<SUBJECT>Constant Volume Combustion (CVC) Technology for Vulcan Program Phase II
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-09-70
<ARCHDATE>11302009
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Contracting Officer, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office (TTO) seeks to further develop Constant Volume Combustion (CVC) technology under Phase II of the Vulcan program.  CVC technology is recognized as having the potential to significantly impact multiple Defense and Commercial Applications. DARPA is interested in ultimately conducting a full scale demonstration of the technology. 

CVC technology can be integrated into a turbine engine through many different architectures – a combined-cycle propulsion system with a separate CVC engine and a turbine engine sharing a common inlet and common nozzle; CVC engine integrated into a turbine engine fan duct; CVC engine integrated into a turbine engine augmentor; and a hybrid system, where a turbine engine combustor is replaced with a CVC module.  Each of these arrangements improves the performance and increases the capability of turbine engines.

A business case analysis (BCA) of CVC engine applications was recently completed.  This study evaluated the cost and benefits of applying CVC engine technology to marine markets and explored the possibilities associated with extending this application to future aviation, commercial, and industrial markets.  Results of the analysis showed that integrating CVC technology into ship-based power gas turbines using a hybrid approach results in fuel savings with potential payback of retrofit cost within three years. 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

CVC has the potential to significantly decrease the fuel consumption of U.S. Navy surface combatants and provide increased capability.  Despite their small output and size relative to the propulsion turbine units, the ship power turbine units on these ships can consume as much as half the fuel.   In addition, electrical power requirements for current and future U.S. Navy surface vessels continue to grow due to the need to incorporate more capable and more numerous defensive and offensive systems to address new threats and missions.   Replacement of the conventional combustors and integration of CVC into the power generation gas turbines on these vessels promises additional ship electrical power and lower Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC).   

The goal of the Vulcan program is to design, build, and demonstrate a full-scale CVC engine.  It is desired in Phases II and III to integrate a CVC module into a turbine engine to replace the original baseline combustor to create a more efficient and more capable power generation unit.  The intent would be to provide a combustor replacement to a turbine engine with minimal modification.  As a result, the CVC concept selected must balance performance and capability versus complexity and cost to upgrade the turbine.  The resulting Vulcan engine will be ground tested in a facility to verify power output and SFC at various power settings, assess impact to other gas turbine components such as the compressor and turbine, and validate durability.  It is expected that this successful demonstration will enable a follow-on acquisition program for conversion kits to existing turbine engines or to provide a new class of turbine engines for use on current and future U.S. Navy surface combatants.  

This component of the Vulcan demonstration program will be conducted in two phases:

•	Phase II:  Component Demonstration and Risk Reduction, CVC Component Integration and Durability Testing at Full-Scale, Turbine and Compressor Rig Testing with a Full-Scale CVC Simulator  
•	Phase III:  Vulcan Engine Performance Testing 

DARPA is interested in an end-to-end demonstration system solution, capable of rapid transition to the U.S. Navy.  Because this is a CVC technology development program intended to develop and demonstrate a fully capable turbine engine-based ship power generation system, DARPA expects that teams will include expertise in that area as well as CVC.  Technology developers with expertise in specific component areas are encouraged to team with a company capable of delivering a full turbine engine.

BACKGROUND

Phase I of the Vulcan program focused on a combined-cycle propulsion system architecture, separate CVC and turbine engines, intended for high-Mach military aircraft. Based on the compelling results of the recent BCA and guidance from DARPA leadership, the scope of Phases II and III has been modified to focus on naval ship-based power generation applications using a hybrid system, where an existing turbine engine is retrofitted by replacing the combustor with a new CVC module.

It is expected that the CVC technology demonstrated in Phases II and III will have traceability and provide risk reduction for many existing and future commercial and industrial applications and other engine architectures, including designs and scalability for incorporation into ship-based propulsion gas turbines, aviation turbine engines, and land-based power generation and other uses.


ADDITIONAL ANNOUNCEMENTS

Further details on the solicitation for proposals will follow in a BAA (Broad Area Announcement) release.  The BAA is anticipated to be released in October 2009.

Until the release of this BAA, the government reserves the right to respond to any requests from any current Vulcan performer or any other responder to this notification as deemed appropriate.

TTO conducts research and development of high-risk, high-payoff advanced tactical military systems. TTO’s mission is to develop highly capable systems that enable orders of magnitude improvement in military capabilities, avoid technological surprise in the TTO areas of emphasis, and efficiently manage and transition existing programs to the DoD Services. TTO areas of emphasis include: advanced platforms (air, sea, space and ground), space operations, unmanned systems, directed energy systems and precision strike. Descriptions of current TTO programs may be found at www.darpa.mil/tto.

An electronic copy of the solicitation, when released, will be available at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered. No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued. All amendments to the solicitation will likewise be posted to this website. Contractors are cautioned to check this website for amendments.

<DESC>NASA/Glenn Research Center is conducting a progressive competition to conductAdvanced Vehicle Concepts System Studies for Subsonic Commercial Transport AircraftEntering Service in the 2030-2035 period. This effort is a full and open competition and is being acquired in two distinct phases.The first phase conducted advanced vehicle concepts system studies for subsoniccommercial transport aircraft entering service in the 2030-2035 time period. The secondphase addresses key technology challenges and to perform initial technologydemonstrations that address enabling technology indentified in phase 1.The initial phase solicitation was described in the February 22, 2008 posting toFedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service, NNH08ZEA001N.The initial phase contracts were awarded to:General Electric Company and Northrop Grumman, on September 29, 2008.A progressive competition strategy will be used with down-selection of sources from theinitial phase to determine the single second phase contractor. The competition for thesecond phase will build on the results of the initial phase, and the award criteria forthe second phase includes successful completion of the initial phase requirementsidentified below. Accordingly, NASA anticipates that only the initial phase contractorswill be capable of successfully competing for the second phase. A new, formalsolicitation will not be issued for the second phase. Instead, proposals will be requested from the initial phase contractors by a LetterRequest for Proposal (RFP) that will include detailed proposal preparation instructionsand evaluation criteria. However, any responsible source may submit a proposal for the second phase, and theseproposals will be considered by the Agency. Prospective offerors for the second phaseother than the initial phase contractors will be provided all the material furnished tothe initial phase contractors necessary to submit a proposal. To be considered for the second phase award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturityequivalent to that of the initial phase contractors, such demonstration to include thefollowing initial phase deliverables upon which the second phase award will be based: 	Development of a credible future scenario within which to describe the challengesthat may be facing commercial aircraft operators in the 2030-35 and beyond timeframe.This scenario establishes a context within which the proposed advanced vehicle concept(s)may meet a market need and enter into service.	An advanced vehicle concept(s) study that will define a vehicle whose missioncapabilities would enable it to fill a broad, primary need in the 2030-35 and beyondtimeframe. See Statement of Work for additional requirements regarding the concept study. 	A prioritized suite of enabling technologies and corresponding technologydevelopment roadmaps required to realize the proposed advanced vehicle concept(s) by the2030-35 timeframe.The following draft Phase 2 evaluation factors are provided for your information.  Pleasenote that these evaluation factors are not final, and NASA reserves the right to changethem at any time up to and including the date upon which Phase 2 proposals are requested. Any such changes in evaluation factors will not necessitate issuance of a new, formalsolicitation for Phase 2.The following Phase 2 selection criteria were in the NRA subtopic:	NASAs evaluation of the progress made during Phase 1. 	NASAs evaluation of the relevance of the vehicle concept(s) to the goals of theSubsonic Fixed Wing project (Table 1 of SOW). 	NASAs evaluation of the ability of the award recipient to address the keytechnology challenges and to refine the vehicle concept(s) identified in Phase 1. 	The availability of award recipients resources, cost, and qualifications of theteam to support the proposed work for Phase 2. 	A clear statement of what intellectual property is expected to be publiclyavailable at the conclusion of the work. It is NASAs intent that all deliverables underthe contract be provided to NASA with unrestricted/unlimited rights; thus, anyrestrictions must demonstrate a significant net benefit to NASA and may cause a lowerscore.Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity mayrender the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking Clinical Centers (CCs) for a four-year continuation of the multi-center Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).  The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of the LTRC Solicitation NIH-NHLBI-HR-11-12.  THIS IS A SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.

The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through studies of human lung tissues. The LTRC facilitates histopathological and molecular research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium.  Collections of specimens are linked to extensive, individual clinical and phenotypic data.  The LTRC will consist of multiple Clinical Centers (CCs), a Radiology Center (RC), a Tissue Repository (TR), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and possibly, External Contributors through the DCC contract.  The CCs will enroll subjects and perform extensive clinical phenotyping.  The RC will perform quantitative analyses and archiving of high resolution chest computed tomography (CT) images.  The TR will process tissues and prepare specimen collections in accordance with investigator requests.  The DCC will manage the study and a central database, provide data quality assurance, and coordinate the review and approval of requests for tissues and data.  External Contributors, if used, will submit data and biospecimens collected according to the LTRC protocol from individuals with specific, targeted conditions. 

The NHLBI anticipates multiple awards under a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Clinical Centers (CCs).  The CCs will 1) obtain and maintain approval for CC activities described in the LTRC Protocol Manual; 2) have expertise in pulmonary diseases and participate fully in the activities of the Steering Committee; 3) obtain and maintain training of appropriate staff in LTRC protocols and procedures; 4) identify potential donor subjects, collect screening data necessary to determine eligibility for participation, recruit and enroll the number of donor subjects prescribed, and perform clinical testing and collect donor subject data; 5) procure biological specimens from enrolled donor subjects, perform initial specimen processing, and transmit processed biological specimens to the Tissue Repository; 6) acquire CT images, de-identify the images, and transmit to the Radiology Center; 7) perform quality control and quality assurance activities; 8) report adverse events; 9) identify any problems with existing LTRC procedures and devise strategies to improve procedures; 10) participate with other LTRC investigators in up to two collaborative clinical research substudies; and, 11) conduct approved research studies and disseminate the results and conclusions to the research community.

Title of Project: Replace Potable Water Tanks and Associated Infrastructure.
Location:  Ash Mountain, Sequoia National Park, Tulare County, California.
Description:  This project will replace the failing potable water storage tanks, replace the water distribution system, and provide limited fire protection (to emergency communication functions inside the Administration/Visitor Center and Fire Management Office building) at the Ash Mountain Headquarters and housing area in Sequoia National Park.  The existing water storage tanks were built in the 1930's and have reached the end of their life cycle.  They will be replaced with new water storage tanks that meet the seismic building code.  The existing public drinking water system is fed from a well and surface water spring and is considered to be a rural water system.  The existing Water Treatment Plant will remain fully operational during the project.  The existing concrete water tanks are to be demolished.  Sustainable elements of this project include replacing water closet and urinal plumbing fixtures for water conservation and installing a photovoltaic array on the roof of the Warehouse building to offset the cost of treating surface water.   
The Work includes demolition of two concrete water tanks with 100,000 gallons and 45,000 gallons of capacity, respectively; demolition of associated piping; construction of three 50,000 gallons (each) cast-in-place concrete water tanks; new water distribution main, valves, fire hydrants, water service lines and meters.  A continuous, 3-day water supply must be maintained during the project without interruption and shall be reflected in the project schedule and sequencing.  The work requires installing temporary water storage tanks and piping that are fully operational before the beginning construction on the other aspects of the water system.  Water supply is to be maintained throughout the construction period to the Administration buildings and housing area serviced by the existing water tanks.  Project schedule and sequencing shall provide for continuous water supply.  
Additionally, the project will: replace existing water closets and urinals throughout the Headquarters Area, with water conserving plumbing fixtures; protect three (3) rooms that are critical to the Park's emergency operations with the installation of a "green" clean agent suppression system; modify and construct enclosures for those protected rooms; and install photovoltaic panels on the roof of the Warehouse Building. Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. 
Estimated price range: $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 
Time for completion: Approximately ten (10) months from the notice to proceed. 
Proposal receipt date is approximately February 19, 2010; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available. 
All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. Small Disadvantaged Business and HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns (May 2004) & 52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (July 2005) (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic SB Search).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 448190   1. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has a requirement to provide Superfund Removal Program personnel (e.g. On-Scene Coordinators (OSC)) with Identification (ID) clothing to allow for easy identification of EPA personnel during emergency responses,national incidents and exercises.  As a result, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) in accordance with FAR Part 13.303 for a five-year period for ID clothing (e.g., polo shirts, tee-shirts, long-sleeved denim shirts, long-sleeved dress shirts, sweatshirts, coach-style jackets, fleece jackets, field vests and baseball-style caps) with potential vendors who have the ability for short notice production and delivery, as well as standard production and delivery times not to exceed six (6) weeks from the date the order is placed.  The clothing items required will be identified in the Request for Quote (RFQ), and need to be available for both men and women.  EPA will provide the appropriate graphics to the successful offeror.  A BPA, as referenced in FAR Part 13.303-1, is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply; the contract generally establishes prices, terms, conditions, and the period covered.
2. Award will be based on best value and the quote that is most advantageous to the Government; cost and/or other factors considered.  Consequently, we request samples of T-shirts at no charge be submitted with quotes in order to evaluate the quality of T-shirts.
3. A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-10-00058 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/1000058/index.htm and https://www.fbo.gov.  
4. The point of contact (POC) for this request for quotes is Manuela Meyer, Contract Specialist, meyer.manuela@epa.gov.  Please copy Elaine Scott, Contracting Officer, scott.elaine@epa.gov on ALL email correspondence.
5. Please submit your Request for Quote (RFQ) via electronic mail to Manuela Meyer, Contract Specialist at meyer.manuela@epa.gov and Elaine Scott, Contracting Officer, scott.elaine@epa.gov in accordance with the deadline specified in Block 10 of the RFQ.  No phone calls please.
6. This is a combined synopsis/Request for Quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only request for quote (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The existing roadway pavement section is 2 inches of asphalt concrete over 4 inches of ABC; although, this section is significantly deteriorated over the approximate lower third of this reach.<BR><BR>2.3 Driveway: The driveway is approximately 230 feet in length and 12 feet wide. The existing roadway pavement section is 2 inches of asphalt concrete over 4 inches of ABC.  <BR><BR>2.4 Parking Area: The parking area is delineated on the attached Detail 1. The thickness of the existing pavement section is unknown. The Corps of Engineers shall remove and fill the existing manhole located near the entrance to the Parking Area prior to Contractor starting work in this area. <BR>3.  CLIN 0001, GRADE AND PAVE ACCESS ROADS: Construct new asphalt concrete pavement surface for the Spillway Access Road, Nelson Road, Driveway, and Parking Area. <BR>3.1 Asphalt Pavement Section:  Pavement section shall be 2.5 inches of asphaltic concrete (AC) pavement over a minimum of 4 inches of milled asphalt/ABC.  The pavement section shall include a thickened edge constructed in accordance with Uniform Standard Details for Public Works Construction, Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG), Standard Detail No. 201, Type B. Asphalt concrete pavement materials shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, MAG Standard Specifications for Asphalt Concrete (Section 710,  inch, Marshal Mix).  Placement and testing requirements for the asphaltic concrete pavement should be in accordance with MAG Standard Specifications for Asphalt Concrete Pavement (Section 321). <BR><BR>3.2 Milling of Existing Asphalt Concrete Pavement and Base Preparation: The existing asphalt concrete pavement shall be milled to provide a well graded mixture with a maximum nominal particle size of  inch.  <BR><BR>The Spillway Access Road shall be milled to full width; however, only 22 feet of width shall be repaved (except for those areas specifically noted above as wider or narrower). Nelson Road shall be milled to full width and repaved to a 12 foot width. The Driveway shall be milled to full width and repaved to a 12 foot width with an approximate 15 foot radius on both sides of the connection point to Marina Road.  All existing pavement in the Parking Area shall be milled and the area repaved to the approximate limits shown on the attached Detail 1. Milling where paving extends below guard rails shall be as close as possible without damaging the guardrails. Pavement below or beyond the guardrail shall be left in place if undisturbed by milling. If it is loosened by the milling it shall be removed and disposed of by additional milling. <BR><BR>The milled asphalt concrete in the Spillway Access Road, Nelson Road, and the Driveway shall be integrated/mixed into the full depth of the existing ABC to provide a minimum 4 inch depth of base material. In the Parking Area, 4 inches of Aggregate Base Course (ABC) shall be placed after milling of the existing pavement.  ABC materials shall be in accordance with Uniform Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, MAG Standard Specifications for Base Materials (Section 702, Aggregate Base). Any excess subgrade materials shall be exported to the low spot on Nelson Road and used as subgrade fill, as described below. Drainage in the Parking Area is to be maintained to the existing central drain. All milled asphalt concrete/ABC shall be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent of the maximum dry density at a moisture content of optimum or lower as determined by ASTM D1557 (Modified Proctor). Testing of milled asphalt concrete/ABC for field density, field moisture content, and moisturedensity relationship shall be in accordance with US Army Corps of Engineers Construction Control Manual Pamphlet No. 415-1-2 with the test frequencies as described in Table 2.1-C, 1 and 3.<BR><BR>3.3 Grading and Subgrade Preparation: Grading shall generally be accomplished to the existing elevations and slopes or as shown on the attached Details 2 and 3. Grading shall include the removal of all existing surface vegetation and other organics, any fills and/or backfills, any disturbed soil, and any unstable (loose, soft, wet, etc.) soils, if encountered, from all proposed pavement areas.  All areas of excavation should be observed by a representative of the Corps of Engineers after clearing and during subsequent scarification to verify removal of all undesirable materials before any filling operations begin at the Site. Widen any resulting depressions as necessary to accommodate compaction equipment and provide a level base for placing fill.  Subsequent to the surface clearing and grubbing efforts, the exposed natural ground surface in those areas not currently covered with existing pavement should be prepared to a minimum depth of 6 inches below all proposed pavement areas.  Subgrade preparation shall include scarification, moisture conditioning (or aeration), and compaction.  Subgrade shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of the maximum dry density at a moisture content of 2 percent below optimum or lower as determined by ASTM D1557 (Modified Proctor).  Material testing shall be in accordance with US Army Corps of Engineers Construction Control Manual Pamphlet No. 415-1-2 with the subgrade test frequencies as described in Table 2.1-B, 1 and 3.<BR><BR>3.4 Drainage Improvements: The low spot identified along the Spillway Access Road just west of the access gate shall be filled after milling, such that a minimum slope of 1/2 of 1 % grade shall be maintained to a discharge point near the south west edge of the drainage where erosion was noted. Rough surveying indicates that fill will be required for a distance of approximately 80 feet to the west of the inlet location. A flaired end culvert and approximately 40 feet of 12-inch diameter corrugated metal pipe (CMP) pipe shall be placed for conveying runoff down the road embankment. A rolled asphalt berm shall extend approximately 150 feet from this discharge point going east along the south edge of the roadway. This berm shall be 4 to 6 inches higher than the edge of the road surface, and provide secure water passage to the inlet. A similar berm shall extend approximately 25 feet to the west to conduct water from the west into the inlet.  <BR><BR>To minimize import of material, the milled asphalt concrete and existing ABC from the low area should be salvaged by rolling to the edge or grading up station toward the dam for later spreading on the fill section. Subgrade fill and ABC shall be placed and compacted as described above.<BR><BR>At each end of the new fill section, a vertical curve will be required to transition from the two slopes. Surveying is not anticipated for this work, and the acceptance criteria will be pleasing to the visual eye and not an abrupt change in slope at 25 miles per hour.<BR><BR>3.5 Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan: The Contractor shall develop and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan in accordance with the requirements of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.<BR><BR>4.  CLIN 0002, AGGREGATE BASE FILL: Contractor shall provide a per ton price (based on full truck loads) to procure, load, transport, place, and compact ABC in the Parking Lot Area and in areas where following milling of the existing surface the milled asphalt concrete/ABC thickness/quality is deemed deficient by the Contracting Officers Representative.  An estimated quantity of 350 tons has been established for this item.  ABC materials shall be in accordance with Uniform Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, MAG Standard Specifications for Base Materials (Section 702, Aggregate Base). <BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W9113M-09-R-0010, for the Advanced Development of Medical Radiation Countermeasure (MRC) will be issued on or about 13 October 2009 with an anticipated contract award on or about 31 March 2010.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.<BR>Small business prime contractors are required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), the concern shall perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.  The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4). Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors. <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, with a size standard of 500 employees. The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.  <BR>The MRC shall be a drug or biologic that can be expeditiously developed, and when used after exposure to doses of ionizing radiation sufficient to cause the gastrointestinal (GI) subsyndrome of acute radiation syndrome (ARS), will either prevent/reduce the extent of incipient radiation injury or promote repair of manifest radiation injury to allow preservation/restoration of the anatomic integrity and normal physiologic functioning of the GI tract resulting in increased survival, reduced incapacitation, and sustained operational effectiveness. MRCs carrying logistical burdens (e.g., special handling or storage conditions lower than -20 degrees Celsius) may be acceptable, but are much less desirable. The MRC should be delivered by minimally invasive means and in as few doses as possible.  <BR>Development and delivery of the MRC product shall require a Contractor to coordinate and manage the activities associated with advanced development of the product. The Contractor will be responsible for conducting the various activities associated with drug/biologic development in manners that are consistent with eventual approval or licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Associated Technology Development activities will include, but are not limited to: manufacturing process development and related tasks, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant small-scale manufacturing and testing of the radiation countermeasure product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing in animals, pilot animal efficacy studies, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conducting a Phase I clinical trial in accordance with FDA regulations and guidelines. After successful completion of the Technology Development efforts and Government review, the Contractor shall conduct necessary follow-on advanced developmental activities leading to FDA approval of the developmental end item.  The Contractor will be required under the base contract to provide one (1) FDA approved MRC.  The Government anticipates FDA approval of the MRC within 3 to 6 years after contract award, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  A CLIN for production quantities of the FDA approved MRC will also be included in the awarded contract as an option.  <BR>Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the Best Value to the Government.  Delivery schedules of the FDA approved MRC shall be proposed by the offerors and will be used as one of the evaluation criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation. The current FY10-15 program/budget funding for this project is $12.29M. Additional funding is envisioned in the subsequent DoD Budgets, starting with the FY12-17 Program Objectives Memorandum. All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 13 October 2009 at the JPEO-CBD website hyperlink http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/packs/Default2.aspx?pg=180.  Scroll down to the bottom of the webpage and select the RFP number W9113M-09-R-0010.  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained because the acquisition will be posted on the above website.

<DESC>The 21st Space Wing, Peterson AFB, CO has a remote installation located at Thule Air Base, Greenland which is the United States Air Force's northernmost base located at (76 320 North latitude by 68 500 West longitude). The base is located 695 miles north of the Arctic Circle and 947 miles south of the North Pole on the Northwest side of the island. Thule has approximately 7,500 tons of scrap metal with potential recycle value in various sizes which needs to be removed and recycled. The contractor would be responsible for all labor, transportation, licensing, bonding, insurance, equipment, and transportation required to ship the material to a recycling facility.
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement but a survey to locate potential sources to remove the scrap metal at Thule AB, Greenland. In accordance with international agreements with the Danish government, this requirement must first be offered to Danish and Greenlandic companies. If there are no Danish/Greenlandic companies showing interest, then the requirement will be opened up to US companies, therefore US companies are encouraged to provide information as well.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (service disabled veteran owned small business, veteran owned small business, hubzone, 8(a), small disadvantage business, small business, or large business) relative to NACIS 423930 (size standard of $8.8 million). Reponses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>Response to this notice shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. Name, address, telephone #, point of contact, and the size of your business.<br />2. A service capability statement.<br />3. Three customer references to which you have provided similar services.<br />4. Copies of applicable licensing and any product catalogs(s). <br />5. The Government is looking to recycle this metal and as such generate revenue. With that in mind, please list the potential markets for this scrap steel.<br />6. For each market listed, please provide a snapshot in time for the month of December of the market value of scrap metal.<br />7. Possible type of contract your company would recommend to accomplish this contract. Are there any specific contract types that may result in a "no-bid" decision by your company? <br />8. Based upon the requirement, what length of contract would be most advantageous? <br />9. What workload estimates are necessary to adequately scope the workload associated with this contract? Is there other data the Air Force could provide that would be useful in determining level of service required? What type of data?<br />10. What discounts and payment terms are customarily offered/negotiated on similar contracts?<br />11. What is the risk areas associated with this effort? How should they be mitigated? <br />12. Type of equipment required to accomplish the job.<br />13. Provide information on the shipping port(s) you might use.<br />14. The USAF realizes Thule AB is in a remote and isolated portion of the globe and thus there will be costs associated with taking this scrap metal to the recycling markets. Therefore, as part of this sources sought interested parties shall provide an idea of this cost. This shall be represented as an estimated percentage decrease (or range) from the market index for the scrap metal. For example, proposed market index for scrap steel in December 2009 is US $110/ton and you estimate a 15% - 25% reduction in this index to cover the cost of taking this material to market. Thus, the net income USAF might expect is US $82 - US$93/ton. Note: These are budgetary estimates. Final numbers will be requested with an official bid. The scrap and miscellaneous metals will be un-segregated and unprepared, with no more than 10% by weight consisting of other materials (wood, glass, rubber, plastic, concrete, etc).<br /><br />Important facts:</p>
<p>1. The description of the scrap metal pile is as follows:</p>
<p>- Pipe diameters vary from 4 inch to 16 inch and it is all standard weight or SCH 40 <br />- Pipe lengths vary with most around 20 ft and there are welded flanges, bends, tees, and a few valves attached <br />- Steel plate thickness is about 70% (by area) 1/4 inch, 10% 1/2 inch, 10%<br />5/8 inch and 10% 3/4 inch<br />- Steel plate size vary with maximum dimensions around 10 ft<br />- Each tank was 2.5 million U.S. gallons; Number of tanks already torn down 26<br />- Tank height was 40'<br />- Tank diameter was 100'<br />- Tank wall thickness was: Bottom 1/3 - 1", mid 1/3 - 3/4", top 1/3 - 1/2"<br />- There are various 12" and 16" inlet/outlet/transfer pipeline pieces along with both 12" and 16" valves from the tanks and pipeline.</p>
<p>Original tank dimensions were 100 ft diameter and 40 ft height with a conical roof. We have about 2,100 tons of piping and 5,200 tons of scrap from the tanks, a total of 7,300 tons.</p>
<p>Other Important Facts:</p>
<p>1. The only means to remove the scrap metal from Thule AB is via ship or air. <br />2. Due to the weather conditions at Thule, outdoor work normally needs to be accomplished between May to September. During this period, May, Jun, and July, and most of August will have 24 hours of daylight. <br />3. Due to the weather the dock is generally open from Jun through mid September. <br />4. The Pier is capable of receiving large ships and is located approximately 1 mile away on improved dirt road from the scrap pile. There are no roads or rail service out of Thule AB.<br />5. The airport is also located approximately 1 mile away from the scrap pile. <br />6. Contractor will be required to provide all of the required equipment to transport the scrap metal to the pier for loading onto the ship, which will be coordinated with the onsite contractor. <br />7. Two Danish ships come to Thule AB to off-load supplies. They depart and return to the port in Aalborg Denmark. The first ship arrives at the beginning of July and the second ship arrives in Aug. There is a charge associated with transporting items on these ships. <br />8. One American ship comes to Thule AB to off-load supplies. It departs and returns to Norfolk, Virginia and normally arrives at Thule AB in mid July.<br />9. Lodging is available on Thule for approximately $35.00 per night, food for approximately $9.00 per day, and a rental car for approximately $100.00 per day. <br />10. All questions need to be provided in writing. For Danish/Greenlandic interested parties: Contact Patrick King via email at patrick.king@det1.dk and for US interested parties contact David Sonnenberg via email at david.sonnenberg@peterson.af.mil or Renata Ott via email at renata.ott@peterson.af.mil.<br />11. If required, a site visit can be arranged for any interested contractor at no cost to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is seeking sources for commercial sleeping bag liners domestically manufactured to be Berry compliant.  The USMC is interested in investigating a sleeping bag liner as a modular component for use with all their sleep systems; currently fielded  modular sleep system, and the MSS  future replacement by the Three Season Sleep System, and developmental extreme cold sleep system over the next 3 to 5 years.  The sleeping bag liner would allow the Marine to tailor layers to optimize comfort from -25F to 100F based upon the items he is willing to carry for the environmental conditions they expect to face.   The USMCs concept of use includes using the liner alone with the bivy cover for upper temperatures when a sleeping bag is too warm, and used in conjunction with any of the sleeping bags to increase warmth at lower temperatures depending on the Marines sensitivity to the cold and his preference for warming layers inside the sleeping bag.    To be suitable for military use, the sleeping bag liner must be; very light, highly compressible and add 5 to 10 degrees protection when used.<BR><BR>Target performance characteristics for the sleeping bag liner follow. Finished weight of 1.3 lbs maximum with 1.0 lbs desired.  The compressed volume of the liner shall not exceed 140 cu in the sleep system compression sack where less volume at 100 cu in is desired. The insulation value of the liner shall add 0.6 clo in thermal manikin testing with 1.0 clo desired.  The liner end item shall be compatible with a center zip sleeping bag, tapered shape, and smooth surface to slip over fleece type clothing layers without generating static electricity and shall have an easy to use closure to keep the liner in position around the users body.   The material shall wick moisture away from sweaty skin, dry fast, provide  high moisture vapor transmission, and be strong to resist tearing or bursting from boot shod feet and rapid stuffing action.  The item shall be durable to a minimum of 30 machine launderings and drying where 50 laundering cycles are desired. The color shall be a subdued green, brown or black, and coyote brown is desired.  The fabric shall be colorfast to laundering, perspiration and wet crocking.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
<p>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative ideas that may support a potential new DARPA program designed to provide revolutionary approaches to materials synthesis, allowing unprecedented materials combinations and synthetic flexibility.</p>
<p>High-impact, technologically-relevant materials such as tribological thin film coatings <br />(e.g., diamond) and electrode materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes) are made via a suite of common synthetic techniques. For the materials of interest in this Request for Information (RFI), all deposition techniques including chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, physical vapor deposition, ion beam sputtering, and atomic layer deposition, employ extreme bulk (macro-scale) conditions such as high temperature (&gt;400 &deg;C), sub-atmospheric pressure, and/or bulk mixing to achieve desired thin film composition, microstructure, morphology, and quality. Use of these bulk processing techniques drastically limits synthetic flexibility and substrate choice (e.g. eliminating most polymers and biological substrates such as living cells), and introduces significant challenges for realizing fine spatial control (e.g. nanoscale patterning). However, at the fundamental level, such materials are built from simple chemical reactions that are inherently local (nano- and atom-scale).</p>
<p>DARPA is interested in detailed submissions of novel approaches to materials synthesis on the local (nano- and atom-scale) level that promote spatial, temporal and output specificity for thin film reactions traditionally requiring extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Complete process approaches that demonstrate the ability to mimic high temperature deposition through localization of reactant generation, removal of by-products, and input/extraction of energy at an atomic scale (i.e. at the reaction location) are of interest. Although successful approaches will likely integrate multiple component strategies, descriptions of control over one aspect of the materials synthesis are also desired. For example:</p>
<p>&bull; Production of reactive species stable at/on a surface for the timeframe, at the location, and in the appropriate flux rates to mimic traditional high temperature thin-film growth; <br />&bull; Demonstration of energy imparted to surface reactants/products to effectively mimic a high temperature surface reaction for thin-film growth without impacting the bulk temperature of the substrate; or <br />&bull; Demonstration of product-specific local reactions, which traditionally require high temperature (&gt;400 &deg;C) and sub-atmospheric pressure, under lower temperature (&lt;200 &deg;C) and/or non-vacuum conditions.</p>
<p>Ideas related to iterative advances of traditional materials synthesis technologies, as well as those that are not focused on radically reducing the overall thermal budget for deposition <br />(i.e., localizing the energy needed exclusively to the site of thin-film growth), and/or do not provide dramatically enhanced spatial control, should not be submitted.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources including, but not limited to, universities, university affiliated research centers, and private or public companies. Presentation of any available preliminary data is encouraged. To ensure that all technically relevant aspects of the RFI are fully addressed, technologies and capabilities should target the following criterion:</p>
<p>i. Novelty: Of particular interest are novel, revolutionary approaches that address materials synthesis though local control of chemical reactions, without the need for high temperatures (&gt;400 &deg;C) and low pressures (&lt;1 atm). Existing intellectual property should be clearly identified. Specifically excluded from this RFI are iterative improvements on current synthetic technologies and non-scalable technologies. Submissions should clearly indicate how the proposed approach radically shifts the traditional paradigms of materials synthesis.</p>
<p>ii. Materials &amp; Applications: Submissions may address any one of a number of technologically-relevant thin-film materials which are generally restricted to high temperature vacuum deposition, including, but not limited to: diamond, BN, TiO2, SiC, carbon nanotubes, graphene, TiB2, ZrO2, YSZ, and B4C. Respondents should:<br />a. Explicitly identify the material(s) compatible with their approach, as well as material(s) that are inherently incompatible. <br />b. Identify applications and insertion opportunities for the identified material(s).</p>
<p>iii. Technical Capability: Submissions must provide evidence and/or theoretical foundations for revolutionary improvements over state of the art technologies in temperature, pressure, and/or spatial control.</p>
<p>iv. Limitations: Submissions should address the underlying scientific and technological barriers as well as any potential limitations (fundamental, technological, or practical) of the approach. An analysis of limiting factors such as materials, chemistry, and/or engineering required for the proposed concept should be highlighted.</p>
<p>v. Related Work and Previous Experience: Examples of current and previous work that provide evidence for the potential of the proposed concept should be included if applicable. Experimental demonstration of LOCO concepts, models, and/or information about currently licensed products is also of particular interest.</p>
<p>vi. Commercialization Opportunity: While focused on revolutionary ideas and concepts, the ultimate goal envisioned is development of a commercial opportunity.</p>

<CONTACT>Della Koelling, Phone 907-586-8852, Email dkoelling@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This project will require the translation of a 5,000 to 10,000 word document focusing on the ecology of invasive species into Yup’ik Eskimo. The wording will be presented in a simple context that will be understandable by a high-school level audience and include a minimum of scientific jargon.  The occasional translation of some terms and concepts foreign to the Yup’ik language may be necessary.
The document will be translated from an English language Microsoft word document, to a Yup’ik language Microsoft word document.  The contractor must be able to speak, read and write the Yup’ik  and English languages proficiently, as well as be able to translate simple to moderately complex concepts between the two.  The document will be divided into self-contained sections.  Each section must be translated in a fashion that retains as much of the original context and meaning as possible.  Care will be placed on using correct grammar and spelling in the translated version, with the intent that the finished translation will need minimal editing in order to meet the standards of quality typically used in USDA Forest Service publications.  Examples of other publications will be provided upon request by the contractor.  The project will be completed in two phases.  The original phase will involve the translation of the text, and the return of it upon completion.  At this point the text will be reviewed by other Yup’ik speakers to insure the validity of the translation.  After this review the text may be returned to the translator for the second phase to make changes and improvements as needed.  The contractor will also agree to have their name listed in the acknowledgements of both the English and Yup’ik versions.

<a href="mailto:ruth.gullette.ctr@usmc.mil">Energy Efficiency Technology</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager, Combat Support Equipment, Shelter Team (PM CSE, MARCORSYSCOM), is conducting a market research to identify potential sources and best practices regarding the availability, design, and development of technologies that enhance the energy efficiency of soft-walled shelters (tents), rigid walled shelters, heating and lighting.  Technologies of interest are those that would most effectively enhance self sufficiency of a Forward Operating Base (FOB) roughly the size of a Marine Corps Company (150 Marines).
The remote locations of USMC FOBs create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations.  These FOBs are currently heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated bulk fuel (i.e. energy). Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous and transportation costs are extremely expensive.  The delivered cost of fuel can easily total ten to a hundred times the original purchase price.  
The need to rapidly establish FOBs for combat operations has resulted in soft-walled shelters that are less than optimal from an energy efficiency perspective.  This places a considerable burden on Environmental Control Units (ECUs) as they struggle to cool/heat interior spaces, which in turn places a considerable burden on generator fuel consumption.  Alternative approaches to energy efficient soft shelters are sought. 
Areas of interest to include, but not limited to thermally efficient shelters, insulating materials, energy efficient lighting, heaters and other technologies that improve shelter thermal efficiency.  
The Marine Corps is in the process of initiating dramatic steps toward rapidly improving the energy efficiency of shelters used in FOBs.  The information received in this RFI will be used to help identify technical solutions suitable for improving the energy efficiency of shelter related FOB operations.  Information received may ultimately result in requests for manufacturers to provide samples to demonstrate their technologies at no cost to the Government. 
Vendors who believe they have a product capable of meeting these requirements are requested to provide two copies of the following: product literature, brochures, price lists, and any other relevant information. All submissions shall be UNCLASSIFIED. Any, and all information submitted, will not be returned.  Submissions shall include: Company's name, business size, mailing address, point of contact information, and email address. Quantity and funding availability are unknown at this time.  Electronic submissions are preferred.  Interested sources should send all responses and capability statements via email to Ruth Gullette at ruth.gullette.ctr@usmc.mil.  Hard copy submissions may be sent to: Marine Corps Systems Command, 2201 Willis St., Quantico, VA 22134-6050, Attn: Ruth Gullette. Responses are due no later than 14 Jan 2010, 2:00 PM Local Time. Submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists.
The Marine Corps Shelter Team will be attending the National Defense Industrial Association, USMC Expeditionary Power and Energy Symposium in New Orleans, 25 - 27 January 2010.  Vendors who wish to meet with the Shelter Team during the symposium to further discuss their products and solutions are requested to submit a meeting request with their RFI literature submittal. Point of Contact is required to include name, email address and telephone numbers. Meeting time will be limited to no more than 45 minutes.  Specific meeting location and schedule To Be Determined (TBD) and will be disseminated prior to the symposium.

<p>Background</p>
<p>WPS contract products support F-15E, F-16, B-1, F-18, F-22, and F-35 operational units worldwide, including foreign countries flying those aircraft. Weapon families supported by WPS contract products include JDAM, JSOW, WCMD, SDB, Paveway IV, AGM-130, and EGBU-15. The Air Combat Command directed the use of PGMPS for all USAF PGM mission planning activities, so the list of weapons supported may increase during the WPS contract period of performance. The WPS contract replaces the PGMPS contract which was awarded in August 2002. The PGMPS contract was a full and open competition, and the WPS contract will follow the same strategy.</p>

<DESC>Developers/manufacturers of mobile kitchens and JP-8 fired kitchen appliances are being sought.  The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager, Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Natick, MA is conducting a Request for Information to locate potential developers/manufacturers for the Battlefield Kitchen (BK) and Battlefield Kitchen Appliances.  The BK is being pursued as the replacement to the Army's Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT).  The BK will be a trailer based kitchen, sized to feed up to 300 personnel at remote field sites.  It will be towed by the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle and prepare the full range of military rations.<BR><BR>The cornerstone of the BK concept is to standardize a modular appliance suite so the appliance compliment and location within the BK will be interchangeable for maximum versatility.  The appliances will be multiples of 22 inches wide.  It is envisioned that there will be single (22 inch), double (44 inch) and possibly triple (66 inch) modules.  All modules will be 24 inches deep.  The maximum height will be approximately 50 inches.  The actual height will be based on the type of appliance and the final system design.  The 50 inch figure is based on the requirement for C-130 aircraft compatibility which limits the total height of the BK to 96 inches.  Assumptions include the trailer chassis will be 38 inches above ground level, floor and ceiling will require 8 inches, leaving 50 inches for the appliance.<BR><BR>Specifications for both the appliance suite and the BK system are currently being prepared.  The draft specification for the appliance suite is available on the following link:  https://www3.natick.army.mil . The BK system specification will be available for release soon.<BR><BR>Improvements over the current MKT will include closed combustion thermostatically controlled appliances, modular interchangeable appliances, hand wash sink with running hot water, integral electrical power source, JP-8 fuel fired appliances that require low electrical power for future inclusion of alternate energy sources, and powered ventilation hood with improved environmental conditions (including heat and noise).  High efficiency, novel systems will be considered with simplicity, maintainability, and lightweight being the main design drivers.<BR><BR>All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Information submissions should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, and relevant company background/experience.  Information submissions must be received NLT 15 Feb 2010.  Responses to this notice should be directed to:  U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems, Food Service Equipment Team, ATTN:  SFAE-CSS-FP-F (Glenn Doucet), Natick MA 01760-5057, facsimile to 508-233-5555, or email to glenn.doucet@us.army.mil.  All information supplied will be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified by the firm or available from other sources without restriction.  This Request for Information is for information and planning purposes only.  This notice is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a commitment by the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center.

This equipment includes Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems (MRI), radiographic/fluoroscopic systems, radiographic systems, computed tomography scanners (CT), nuclear medicine scanners (SPECT/CT, SPECT), ultrasound imaging scanners, and similar equipment.

The government requires maintenance services that include an escalation system, such that if a technician can not determine the problem within a reasonable time, the problem is referred to a senior technician, and should that person not be able to correct the problem, more senior personnel or the product’s hardware/software engineers can be tasked with solving he problem, maintaining uptime for the system in excess of 98%.  

The government requires compliance with the DoD and Federal Information Assurance regulations.  The service providers must comply with the requirements to gain access to DoD networks, which include use of the business to business gateway, national agency checks, compliance with base access regulations, and, for some employees, obtaining a DoD common access card.  The government efforts necessary to process the documentation is such that the government is only willing to process one complete set for maintenance of this equipment (i.e. subcontracting is not authorized.)

At the conclusion of any contract period, the government requires the contractor to verify/certify that only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) authorized parts have been installed in the system, that the system is performing at or better than the original specifications, and that the OEM would accept the product for a new maintenance contract without inspection fees/corrective maintenance costs.

The government requires use of OEM parts which have gone through the OEM (FDA current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) compliant) quality assurance system, and the parts have not been used after the quality assurance process and prior to replacement in the government owned equipment.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-10-14 <br />Proposer's Day Workshop Announcement
<p>Transformer (TX)<br />Tactical Technology Office<br />Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</p>
<p><br />The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Transformer (TX) program. The workshop will occur at 0700-1500 EST on January 14, 2010, at Westin Arlington Gateway, 801 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p>This Special Notice is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Workshop is intended to introduce to the research community the TX program vision, goals and objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The workshop does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance at the workshop is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this workshop.</p>
<p>The objective of the Transformer (TX) program is to demonstrate a 1 to 4 person transportation vehicle that can drive and fly, thus enabling the warfighter to avoid water, difficult terrain, and road obstructions as well as IED and ambush threats. The vehicle will be capable of driving on prepared surface and light off-road conditions, while flight functionality will require Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL). In addition, range and speed efficiencies will allow for tactically relevant missions to be performed on a single tank of fuel. The ability to provide the warfighter a platform that enables terrain-independent mobility would significantly affect how distributed operations are performed today. Current transport systems present operational limitations where the warfighter is either anchored to the ground with HMMWVs and thus vulnerable to ambush, or reliant on helicopters, which are limited in flight speed and availability. TX provides the flexibility to adapt to traditional and asymmetric threats by providing the operator unimpeded movement over difficult terrain. In addition, transportation is no longer restricted to trafficable terrain that tends to makes movement predictable. This enables the warfighter to approach targets from directions opportune to them and not the enemy.</p>
<p>Within the TX program, DARPA seeks to: 1) Develop a robust vehicle design that maximizes military utility at a reasonable cost, 2) Identify and mature the critical enabling technologies necessary to vehicle development, and 3) Build a single prototype vehicle that demonstrates the program goals through ground and flight tests. Technologies relevant to the objectives of the TX program can be found in numerous disciplines and areas of research including: adaptive wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight composite materials, advanced flight control technology for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight, hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, and others.</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a TX Proposers' Day Workshop. The workshop will: (a) Introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the TX program vision and objectives; (b) Explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) Promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the TX program goals. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical. Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate discussions during the poster session.</p>
<p>There is no fee to attend the TX Proposers' Day Workshop. Registration for the workshop is limited by the venue capacity. To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of three persons per organization. Early registration is strongly recommended. The poster session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 100 posters total. The registration cutoff date is 4:00PM ET, January 7, 2010.</p>
<p>Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>Workshop Details: <br />Time: January 14, 2010, 7:00am-3:00pm<br />Location: Westin Arlington Gateway<br />801 North Glebe Road<br />Arlington, VA 22203 <br />(800) 627-7076 (Reservations)<br />(703) 717-6200 (Hotel Operator)<br />Registration Website: http://www.sa-meetings.com/TX2010 (Password = TX2010)</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY&ndash; Network Operations Center (NOC) Support Services for the Operation and Management of the NOAA Research Network <br />&nbsp;<br />IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5, THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA), ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE (AGO), INTENDS TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO INDIANA UNIVERSITY FOR NETWORK OPERATIONS CENTER (NOC) SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE NOAA RESEARCH NETWORK. <br /><br />THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has determined Indiana University is the sole source capable of performing the requirements necessary for support services from a vendor that has (1) extensive knowledge and experience in providing Network Operations Center (NOC) support for high performance research networks and (2) partnerships with the Regional Optical Networks (RON) consortiums.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />NOAA shall execute a sole source firm fixed price contract to Indiana University with the demonstrated ability of provide the required NOC Services characteristics (below) with a base period and four option years. The anticipated award date is on or about March 2, 2010.&nbsp; The NAICS code is 541513 - Computer Facilities Management Services.<br />&nbsp;<br />This Special Notice does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. Nor does this Special Notice constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that any procurement action that may be issued for the Government's requirements related Network Operations Center (NOC) support for high performance research networks.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Department of Commerce (DOC) / National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) / Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is undertaking efforts to design, engineer, build and operate a national-wide high-performance research network to interconnect NOAA research supercomputing facilities.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />NOC Services Characteristics Required<br />Important characteristics of Network Operations Center Support services are further defined to require:<br />&nbsp;<br />A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24x7x365 technical support of the NRN network for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 support levels.<br />B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOC/NOAA security-approved configuration management techniques to ensure optimal network operation and uptime characteristics<br />C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuous monitoring of the operational status of the NRN, which is built on the I2 and NLR research networks.<br />D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis and optimization of the NRN network utilizing networking tools developed specifically for research and education networks.<br />E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On-going visualization of NRN network status, for the purpose of analysis and optimization of data transfer <br />F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consultation on NRN design in order to optimize operation and to monitor services. <br />&nbsp;<br />The vendor must have a longstanding knowledge and experience within the national research networking community to provide the unique NOC services that are needed for the NOAA Research Network.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Required Critical Elements for Performance Achievement<br />Defined critical elements that are required for the NRN project within the strict time requirements:<br />&nbsp;<br />A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-established, longstanding working relationship with all Regional Optical Networks (RONs) cited for the NRN project. NOAA will be installing government networking equipment at various RON sites and upon successful installation, will need immediate operation and monitoring support. Preexisting RON relationships will meet this requirement, and interested parties should articulate their preexisting relationships with all Regional Optical Networks (RONs).<br />&nbsp;<br />B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-established, longstanding working relationship and technical involvement with Internet-2 (I2) and the National Lambda Rail (NLR), both of which will provide the communications backbone for NRN. The NRN will be built with government owned equipment, installed at RON sites, and interconnected via I2 and NLR networks to establish a NOAA private research network.&nbsp; Use and access to I2/NLR has stringent membership requirements.&nbsp; The proposed vendor must meet this requirement to currently provide NOC services for both I2 and NLR to a number of clients within the research and education community <br />&nbsp;<br />C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediate access and familiarity with RON facility collocation sites. The proposed vendor must currently provide the NOC services for the two US Academic Research and Education (R&amp;E) WAN networks (I2 &amp; NLR) as well as the trans-Pacific WAN (TransPAC2.) They must also provide NOC services for multiple RONs and GigaPops (AMPATH, CIC OmniPOP). This meets the strict timeline and research network experience needed by the NRN. <br />&nbsp;<br />D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fully integrated and deployed custom monitoring and analysis tools that have been developed to address the specific requirements of the research networking community. The proposed vendor must have extensive integration, support, and NOC services supplied to I2, NLR, RONs and the Research Networking community as a whole, and they must have developed, proofed and deployed multiple network monitoring tool sets customized specifically to support R&amp;E ultra-high speed networks such as PerfSonar.<br />&nbsp;<br />E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nation-wide, consolidated research network operation and maintenance support. As stated in element three above, the vendor must have, and continues to provide critical NOC services for the key network resources that will be used to build NRN.&nbsp; In order to ensure that NRN operates as a highly available, stable flexible, R&amp;E network, the NOC provider must be the binding agent of the independent individual entities. Because this network is integrated from multiple existing networks including I2, NLR, and the RONs the vendor must be uniquely suited to be the binding element to create a single working infrastructure out of separate networks. This existing relationship is mandatory to produce this binding agent within the time required to meet the deadlines of the project.<br />&nbsp;<br />F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost-effective NOC services that provide the best value to the Government. The I2, NLR, the many Regional Optical Networks, GigaPops, participating universities and government entities together make up a community whose main goal is to enable scientific research and education through the integration of these ultra-high speed data networks. The nature of this community is to collaborate, support, and leverage the community&rsquo;s collective talents to provide fiscally responsible networking services to promote their science and research objectives. Because the proposed vendor must be a part of this collaborative community and a not a commercial provider their services, NOAA anticipates services will be provided at a substantially lower cost than a vendor without this historical knowledge and relationship(s).<br />&nbsp;<br />Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response. NOAA&rsquo;s HPC program requires a national, secure, low cost, low latency, highly stable and highly available 10GB per second fiber optic communication network to support its mission requirements. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to operate and monitor NOAA&rsquo;s high-speed fiber optic National Research Network (NRN) supporting NOAA&rsquo;s high performance computing (HPC), video, voice and data communications.&nbsp; <br /><br />All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements contained in this Special Notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. <br />&nbsp;<br />Affirmative responses must be received no later than noon Eastern Time on January 7, 2010. Any questions or responses regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the above e-mail address.&nbsp; Responses shall be e-mailed to Claude.F.Bordelon@noaa.gov.<br />THIS NOT A SOLICITATION.<br />

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, DELIVERY ORDER AGAINST GSA FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE GS23F0120P FOR ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING FIRM TO DEVELOP A ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING CONCEPT DESIGN, DESIGN NARRATIVE, CONCEPT SPECIFICATION, CONCEPT COST ESTIMATE AND UPDATED PROGRAM OF REQUREMENTS FOR THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATOMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA), ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY COMPUTING CENTER (NESCC), A LARGE SCALE SUPERCOMPUTER DATA CENTER FACILITY.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO X-NTH INCORPORATED, 2601 WESTHALL LANE, MAITLAND, FL 32751, UNDER GSA SCHEDULE GS23F0120P.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, posts this notice of intent to issue a delivery order to X-NTH Incorporated, of Maitland, FL against GSA Schedule GS23F0120P for the development of an Architectural and Engineering Concept Design, Design Narrative, Concept Specifications, Concept Cost Estimate and to update the Program of Requirements for the NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center (NESCC), a large scale supercomputer data center facility. NOAA's goal is to commence operation in the NESCC in 2011.</p>
<p>In May 2009, NOAA awarded a delivery order, number WC1330-09-NC-1177, through competitive process, to X-NTH Incorporated against GSA Schedule GS23F120P. X-NTH Incorporated was tasked to develop an architectural and engineering Program of Requirements and cost estimate for the NESCC. X-NTH Incorporated delivered the Program of Requirements dated September 30, 2009. The current requirement for the development of the conceptual design and updating of the Program of Requirements is essentially follow-on work to that X-NTH Incorporated performed on delivery order WC1330-09-NC-1177. The information X-NTH Incorporated gathered from the research they conducted to produce the Program of Requirements is an essential component for expediting the development of the conceptual design package, updating the Program of Requirements and meeting the schedule for operation deployment in 2011. To consider sources other than X-NTH Incorporated would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the operation deployment schedule. A Contractor other than X-NTH Incorporated would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements to the point that they could begin work on developing the conceptual design and updating the Program of Requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from X-NTH Incorporated.<br /><br />This Concept Design is required to provide an entry level design for the purposes of procuring a Developer/Contractor to build out a facility to meet NOAA's High Performance Computing needs. The estimated value of this action is approximately $400,000.00. The scope of this delivery order falls into two phases, Concept Design and Supplemental Engineering Services. The description of task objectives will be conducted in two phases as follows:</p>
<p>Phase One: Concept Design</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop a Concept Design to include Concept Drawings, Concept Specifications, a Design Narrative, Concept Cost Estimate, and update the Program of Requirements dated 09/30/2009.</p>
<p>Phase Two: Supplemental Professional Engineering Services</p>
<p>In addition to providing Concept Design, NOAA requires the Contractor to provide Architect/Engineering (AE) and specialized technical services on an as needed basis over a period of six months. The Contractor shall provide professional engineering services to assist the Government in resolving any technical issues and in performing special design analysis.</p>
<p>This notice is for full disclosure compliance and announcement of potential subcontracting opportunities only. No competitive solicitation package is available, and no offers will be accepted from any source other than X-NTH Incorporated, 2601 Westhall Lane, Maitland, FL 32751, Telephone: (407) 660-0088.</p>

This is notice of a Firm Fixed-Price Task Order No. T2011101074 (TO 46) award made on December 23, 2009, to HDR Engineering, Inc., 8404 Indian Hills Dr, Omaha, NE 68114-4049, in the Firm Fixed-Price amount of $115,251.09 under Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services Indefinite Quantity / Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) Contract No. 1443C2000090100.
This project is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act.
The description of the work involved under this Task Order is shown below:
FOR THE SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) GENERATED POWER COMPONENTS DESIGN-BUILD REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PREPARATION SERVICES WITH LIMITED DESIGN SERVICES FOR SCHEMATIC DESIGN (SD) MODIFICATIONS.
Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The Government determined that the identified contractor is the "only one responsible source" as defined by FAR 6.302-1 for the required Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services.
HDR Engineering, Inc. created the existing Predesign (PD) and Schematic Design (SD) for the installation of the Photovoltaic (PV) Power Generation System on Alcatraz Island.  HDR Engineering, Inc. possesses institutional knowledge of the required submittals and processes with all Key Stakeholders so as not to duplicate efforts, time, or cost.  HDR Engineering, Inc. also has an institutional knowledge crucial for minimizing interference with the normal operations on Alcatraz Island, for minimizing disturbances of avian habitats and activities, for minimizing conflicts with existing facilities and infrastructure, and for identifying necessary restoration work due to project construction.  HDR Engineering, Inc. has accumulated a body of knowledge and expertise concerning the site and system by working closely with The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to facilitate the determination of the most beneficial technology to apply, system configuration and components, and system capability, to include Schematic Design (SD) level structural engineering, and other services to adequately address the installation details of the PV system that is considered vital during the contracting and construction phases of this project as potential bidders and the eventual contractor will require clarifications regarding the basis and, potentially, the value engineering proposals that will require prompt and accurate responses grounded in a firm understanding of the site's conditions and the design parameters on which the construction documents are based.  HDR Engineering, Inc. is the only source that can respond to requests for information and review submittals in a timely manner without duplicating effort to ensure that all aspects of the specifications and drawings are addressed appropriately.  HDR Engineering, Inc. is also the only source that can amend its existing Schematic Design (SD) documents without duplicating efforts and cost.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U. S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) plans to award a contract or a purchase order or a delivery order to Sybase, Inc., for the software maintenance services described below, for calendar-year 2010.  The maintenance will cover technical support and updates for the Sybase IQ software, which is part of the RITA/BTS Enterprise Architecture. The maintenance is usually renewed on an annual basis.  

The RITA/BTS Office of Airline Information TranStats Internet and Intranet Program make extensive use of the Sybase IQ database software produced by Sybase, Inc.  The Sybase IQ software is part of the RITA/BTS Enterprise Architecture.  RITA/BTS has Internet and Intranet data warehouse applications based on the Sybase IQ database technology and the data warehouse is growing.  Sybase charges an annual maintenance fee for their software, which covers technical support.  There are updates to the software too.  It is essential that the TranStats Program receive the updates to remain up to date with the latest data warehouse technology.  Sybase is the sole manufacturer of Sybase IQ database software, and is the sole provider of maintenance for their Sybase IQ database software.  The Integrated Airline Information System, currently under development using other database technology, will replace TranStats, so it is anticipated that calendar-year 2010 or 2011 (due to parallel acceptance testing) will be the last year Sybase maintenance will be required.

USDOT has no other option for purchasing maintenance for the Sybase IQ database software, because Sybase, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of its Sybase IQ database software, and is the sole provider of maintenance for their Sybase IQ database software.  Sybase is the only available source for these services.

Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than Sybase will be able to provide maintenance for the Sybase IQ database software.

Nevertheless, any entity, other than Sybase, Inc., which believes that it can provide the needed software maintenance services to RITA at the high level of quality indispensable to the agency, shall submit a Statement of Qualifications to james.mowery@dot.gov not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Time January 12, 2010.

Statutory Authority Cited:

This sole source purchase is intended to be made under the authority of Title 41 U.S.C. 253(c), “Other Than Full and Open Competition” and as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 6.302-1 (c)), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements – Application for brand name description".

Reason that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited

As noted above, each of the files to be purchased is used to test the validity of the traffic and operating statistics reported by each airline to RITA/BTS’ Office of Airline Information.  The airline data products distributed by OAI are used by DOT aviation policy staff in OST, FAA, OGC, and OIG in administering their congressionally mandated aviation responsibilities.  

14 CFR Part 234.4 requires the use of Official Airline Guide published flight schedule data in processing air carrier reported on-time flight performance statistics that are used to compute flight delay statistics  reads:
 “Reporting of on-time performance.
(a) Each reporting carrier shall file BTS Form 234 ‘‘On-Time Flight Performance
Report’’ with the Office of Airline Information on a monthly basis, setting forth the information for each of its reportable flights held out in the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in the computer reservations systems (CRS), or in other schedule publications.
The reportable flights include, but are not limited to, cancelled flights, mechanically cancelled flights, diverted flights, new flights and wetleased flights. The report shall be made in the form and manner set forth in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Director, Office of Airline Statistics, and shall contain the following information:
(1) Carrier and flight number. 
(2) Aircraft tail number.
(3) Origin and Destination airport codes.
(4) Published OAG departure and arrival times for each scheduled operation of the flight. 
(5) CRS scheduled arrival and departure time for each scheduled operation
of the flight.
(6) Actual departure and arrival time for each operation of the flight.
(7) Difference in minutes between OAG and CRS scheduled arrival times.
(8) Difference in minutes between OAG and CRS scheduled departure times.
(9) Actual wheels-off and wheels-on times for each operation of the flight.
(10) Date and day of week of scheduled flight operation.” (Emphasis added)

Any deviation from the regulations would require a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a change in the reporting requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations.

The designation of the OAG schedule data was based on the fact UBM Aviation Worldwide, LLC’s (formerly OAG Worldwide, LLC) data products are considered to be the most comprehensive data available.  They also underpin every other major travel system in the world including Global Distribution Systems such as Sabre and Worldspan, as well as on-line booking engines, such as ORBITZ, Expedia, and Travelocity.  The OAG is also the source of data used by the FAA in its Enhanced Traffic Management System. 

While the current regulations mandate the use of OAG, it is important, however, to note that a possible future alternate source for flight schedule has been identified in OAI’s market research analysis as described under item 8.  

The Research and Innovative Technology Administration is currently planning to implement an Oracle 11g and Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise solution to replace and improve OAI’s present mid-tier server-based Airline Reporting Data Information System that serves as the platform for collecting, processing, and disseminating recurrent airline data reports submitted pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations.  Part of this process is documenting the current “as  is” state which includes using OAG software to validate the airline data submissions.  OAI envisions that a more detailed alternatives analysis will be conducted in FY 2011 with the implementation of the new Integrated Airline Information System.

Nevertheless, any organization other than UBM Aviation Worldwide, which believes that it can provide to RITA the needed type of software at the high level of quality indispensable to the agency, shall e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to james.mowery@dot.gov not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Time January 12, 2010.

<p>Development of TB Contact Investigations and Genotyping training materials for TB control worker. The consultant for this project will be responsible for designing, developing and writing the training module for TB Contact Investigations.<br /><br />Description/Work Statement</p>
<p>Background and Need<br />Tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne communicable disease. Contact investigations are the cornerstone of TB control programs. Contact investigations help identify people (contacts) who were exposed to a person with infectious TB disease and provide the appropriate treatment, if necessary. In 2005, CDC promulgated new guidelines which included new research, methods, and tools necessary for efficient and effective TB contact investigations. One of the tools highlighted in the contact investigations guidelines is genotyping. Analysis of genotyping data is recommended to identify TB clusters and to determine if there is a need to expand a contact investigation or if an outbreak investigation is required. Currently, the existing U.S. TB educational materials for conducting contact investigations are over 10 years old. Thus, new contact investigation information and genotyping application training materials do not currently exist The need for TB contact investigation and genotyping training materials to transfer knowledge and skills to local and state TB control program staff has been identified in several formal and informal needs assessments conducted by CDC and CDC partners.</p>
<p>To address this need, CDC would like to revise the popular training curriculum, The CDC Self-Study Modules on Tuberculosis, to include an updated module on Contact Investigations and Genotyping. This module series has served as an important resource in training thousands of TB control workers in local, state, and federal programs.</p>
<p>Project Objective <br />The project objective is the development of TB Contact Investigations and Genotyping training materials for TB control workers. The training materials will include a module on Contact Investigations and Genotyping that includes a glossary, study questions, and case studies in a format that is consistent with The CDC Self-Study Modules on Tuberculosis series. The content should incorporate information and tools from published CDC guidelines and input from CDC subject-matter experts. Easy-to-use, stand alone Contact Investigation and Genotyping tools (e.g., checklists, decision flow charts) should be included in the module where appropriate.</p>
<p>Scope of Work <br />The consultant for this project will be responsible for designing, developing, and writing the training module for TB Contact Investigations and related Geonotyping training materials. The consultant will work closely with CDC subject-matter and educational-design experts to ensure that the curriculum is consistent with CDC guidelines. The consultant should have a complete draft of the module ready for field-testing 4 months from the contract start date.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements <br />Under this contract, the Consultant will be required to develop an easy-to understand training module onTB Contact Investigations and Genotyping training materials for TB control workers with accompanying tools. The consultant should have experience in developing TB training curricula with specific experience in Contact investigations, Genotyping, and Cluster Investigations.</p>

<p>Our key audiences will include:</p>
<p>&bull; General public within the Mid-Atlantic (Maryland/DC/Virginia) communities<br />&bull; Tertiary markets ranging from New England through the Carolinas and as far west as Ohio<br />&bull; Proven, dedicated air show fans<br />&bull; Military audiences including active and retired residing throughout the Mid-Atlantic region<br /><br />The following areas of service are needed and your recommended technical plan for the provision of each should be reflected in your proposal.

The Contractor will disclose which elements of the work described below shall be managed in-house and which elements of work shall be subcontracted. The Contractor shall name and describe potential subcontractors for each of the work elements described below, if applicable. The Contractor will be expected to work with the 316 PAO officers, enlisted personnel and civilian staff on communication and marketing initiatives.<br />1. REQUIRED ELEMENTS</p>
<p>STAFFING - The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, and services necessary to perform all identified functions related to Air Show promotions and creative services for the Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington JSOH as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). The contractor shall perform the requirements in this PWS, conforming to the professional standards identified in this PWS and generally accepted within the industry, and shall follow all applicable instructions and directives as identified by this PWS.</p>
<p>a. MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING - Upon Contract Execution, the Contractor shall provide full account management services monthly on or about the final work day of each month. These reports shall expand to weekly beginning six (6) weeks prior to the event and are due on Fridays (beginning on 2 April 2010). At the request of 316 PAO, such reports may be required twice weekly within the period 2 April through 16 May, 2010.</p>
<p>b. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE - Services shall be performed at Contractor's place of business, but be must be available for regular meetings on-site at Joint Base Andrews NAF Washington on a schedule mutually determined by both parties.</p>
<p>c. TIME OF PERFORMANCE - Services shall commence immediately upon Contract execution and shall continue through 31 May 2010, to include provision of a post-show follow-up report. Contractor must be able to provide continued staffing throughout that period of time.</p>
<p>2. STRATEGIC MARKETING PLANNING</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop a campaign timeline that summarizes anticipated project start and completion milestones that includes delivery of each of the elements identified in this PWS.</p>
<p>3. SPECIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>a. BRAND CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- JSOH's current public identity presents several brand challenges, not the least of which is the lack of identity among the general public that the Joint Services Open House is indeed an Air Show. The second challenge will revolve around the official change in the name of Andrews AFB from its current nomenclature to Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility (NAF) Washington, the promotion of which shall not be considered a part of this PWS. However, once established, Contractor on this project must, through the implementation of the brand development campaign on behalf of the Joint Services Open House, develop new brand strategy and or message architecture, for JSOH that is also reflective of the familiar name, Andrews. Such branding will begin with the development of a new logo that effectively communicates both the nature of the Air Show and its deployment at Andrews, albeit under a new name and imagery. All messaging and creative services will derive from these strategies and shall be consistent and impactful against target audiences and achieve agreed performance metrics.</p>
<p>b. TELEVISION COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION - Incorporating the new brand identity created through paragraph 3a. in this statement of work, the Contractor shall develop a series of four 30-second high-impact television commercials, created in such a way that the spot can be edited on an annual basis through voice-over and graphic changes for reuse in subsequent years with only minor budgetary alterations.</p>
<p>As required, the contractor shall develop treatments and scripts for video productions to support program needs. Upon approval of the script, the Contractor shall provide all pre-production, production, and post-production services including scouting sites, identifying talent, securing releases, negotiating buy-outs, scheduling and coordinating video and film shoots, AVID editing, composing original and securing rights of existing music, providing rough cuts as required, and providing a closed-captioned master and the appropriate number of copies upon request.</p>
<p>c. RADIO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION - With oversight and management from 316 PAO, the contractor shall also create radio scripts to fulfill the needs of radio advertising outlets, most commonly :15, :30 and/or :60 scripts, in addition to any short "live read" information handed to the on-air personalities. These spots may also be used as radio public service announcements and may take the form of scripts or they may be pre-produced commercial, at the direction of 316 PAO leadership.</p>
<p>d. PRINT/OUTDOOR/COLLATERAL CREATIVE PRODUCTION - The Contractor's plan for Air Show promotion and marketing shall include the creative development, content development, copy, design, and production management for the following material elements:</p>
<p>Print ads<br />Posters<br />Flyers<br />Billboards<br />Transit Advertising (including mobile billboards, bus exteriors, bus and Metro interior cards and Metro station dioramas)</p>
<p>Contractor must provide all print advertising intended for transit advertising to CBS Outdoor, Inc.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide at least two creative concepts for all major deliverables and subsequent designs. In addition, the contractor shall provide detailed cost estimates and production options, including price breaks at high volumes, to ensure optimum quality output at the most efficient price. All approved concepts and deliverables will be copyrighted to the Department of Defense/Air Force.</p>
<p>e. WEBSITE PRODUCTION - The contractor will work closely with 316 PAO to develop an informative, high impact, and comprehensive website that will provide a one-stop information resource for attendees, members of the media and sponsors to access and gather all information on the JSOH. The Contractor shall update the website with new or corrected information within 24 normal of receiving information from 316 PAO.</p>
<p>f. ONLINE AND SOCIAL MARKETING OUTLETS The contractor will assist 316 PAO in strengthening its online presence through use of Web 2.0 tools and technologies and outreach to new forms of media. This includes outreach through blogs, search engines and websites in an effort to publicize and promote the event as well as incorporation of social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube and others, as appropriate, to achieve similar goals</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>NOTE - All creative elements, including print, broadcast, outdoor/transit, Web 2.0 and banner advertising must achieve agreed communications objectives against target audiences and geographic requirements, defined as: active duty military from all branches of service, retired members, future recruits, local community residents, Washington DC vacationers and multigenerational families of all demographics seeking education, entertainment, and unique patriotic outdoor events in the culturally rich geography of the nations' capital.</p>
<p>g. MEDIA PARTNERSHIP OUTREACH - In conjunction with - or as a precursor to - creation and development of the advertising plan, Contractor shall attempt to engage in media partnership relations with selected newspapers, radio stations and television stations. The concepts behind such relationships are to make these media outlets marketing partners with the event. Such relationships are designed to generate value-added benefits such as added air time or advertising space, an increased presence on the media outlets website, onsite appearances and enhancements and possible media sell through opportunities. Every effort shall be extended to negotiate such partnerships at no cost to the event, but should the terms of the relationship prove to be of better value to the Government when incorporated as part of a media buy - with said enhancements unavailable without such a media buy - then Contractor may incorporate this element into the Advertising strategy.</p>
<p>h. ADVERTISING - The contractor shall secure local (National Capitol Region) media for direct air show promotion to inform attendees about the event, increase general awareness of the event and maximize show attendance.</p>
<p>Media advertisements will consist of radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, transit, direct mail, mobile billboards, online vehicles, onsite signage and/or other approved mediums and be targeted toward strategically located channels and news outlets, occurring with frequency one month before the event and increase to at least once per day in the preceding two weeks until event completion, or at a frequency which meets desired outcome as the assigned budget will allow. Contractor shall determine the advertising and marketing mix that provides the greatest value and optimal levels of exposure for the Government as possible, as determined by budget, reach and frequency numbers. Total advertising budget shall not exceed $105,000.00. For the purposes of this proposal, Contractor should submit a general advertising plan that shows recommended breakdowns of Advertising expenditures, with such plan to reflect the Contractor's best recommendations for placement of advertising while staying within the limitations of the available budget.</p>
<p>Upon execution Contractor shall submit their recommended advertising plan and attain "sign off" from Public Affairs prior to securing said media. Contractor shall also keep 316 PAO informed about pending and upcoming deadlines - including market trends affecting the availability of advertising inventory - well in advance of such deadlines in order to ensure the placement of all desired advertising.</p>
<p>i. TACTICAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION - The Contractor shall provide project management and coordination answerable to deadlines established by 316 PAO, ensuring the agreed plan is executed on time and within the agreed budget to include media placement, employee expenses (to include communication devices) or subcontracting outside services with mark ups not to exceed 15%. The contractor shall provide an integrated program approach that includes detailed project work plans, targeted deliverable dates, estimated costs with a detailed schedule of fixed fees or pricing approach, and anticipated equipment purchases and variable costs for approval. Work plans shall be updated weekly. Weekly project reviews must provide detailed progress in accordance with the agreed work plan that highlights anticipated risks, variable costs and potential budget overruns. In no instance shall the contractor exceed agreed budget items without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>j. PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN - JSOH Management organization requires a full-service firm to form and execute a publicity communications plan to inform, communicate and engage the public of the region of the Washington DC MSA persuading attendance to a FREE air show/open house created for their enjoyment, education, and entertainment. This effort shall also communicate specific "news" elements associated with the event, including the message points detailed below. To a lesser extent, Contractor shall secure select, strategic national earned media to increase awareness of JSOH and Joint Base Andrews NAF Washington.</p>
<p>Message Generation to include:</p>
<p>Attendees: Directions, hour of operations, security considerations, parking and attendance instructions, performances (air and ground), list of displays, allowed and prohibited items, and any other items of information.</p>
<p>Members of the Media: Media contacts, approved graphics, biographies, show facts, downloads of 10 second and 30 second video spots, etc.</p>
<p>Sponsors: Sponsorship opportunities, contact details, etc.</p>
<p>k. PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS (PSAs) - Through the production of the television commercials, radio spots and print ads, Contractor shall engage in outreach efforts to secure placement of such materials as public service ads and announcements, taking into consideration both the cost of the event (FREE) and the public services (i.e., military) orientation of the event. If different from the designed advertisements, the PSAs should be tailored with targeted messages for specific, desired demographics or event elements.</p>
<p>l. MERCHANDISING - The Contractor shall if required by 316 PAO provide all material support to include labor and production expenses for the creation of merchandising elements including, but not limited to t-shirts, hats, lapel pins, posters and other materials showcasing the newly designed logo and identity of the event. For the purposes of this proposal, Contractor must outline their proposed strategy and document their past performance relative to the creation and production of collateral materials, in the event that the 316 PAO decides after contract award to incorporate a merchandising element into the program.</p>
<p>m. WRAP-UP REPORT - Contractor shall furnish 316 PAO with a comprehensive post-event wrap-up report due within two weeks following completion of the air show. This report shall include copies of all advertising and publicity materials generated in support of the show (including screen shot captures of on-line outreach and coverage), and screen shots or line item references to all TV and radio publicity hits. While this wrap-up report is due by 31 May 2010, 316 PAO recognizes that it often takes several weeks for press clipping services to provide all copies of articles that run. For this reason, should the Contractor require additional time to complete the report as they await receipt of final items, Contractor must communicate such request in writing to 316 PAO and an extension deadline shall be granted. The Government will not incur any cost for additional time required by the contractor past 31 May 10.</p>
<p>4. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide references, professional biographies, team member roles/areas of expertise and detailed examples of comparable experience completed within the last 5 years and selected team's proven performance with air shows and large sports or entertainment events with attendees exceeding 75,000. Experience with high level air shows and other localized events considered to be among the most prominent and prestigious in the marketplace is required as is a strong existing relationship with Washington-area mainstream media, including television and radio reporters, editors and assignment directors; newspaper and magazine editors and reporters; calendar and feature editors and managers of "things to do" blogs, websites and newsletters.</p>
<p>5. MANAGEMENT AND STAFF PERSONNEL</p>

Statement of Work: 

1. BACKGROUND:

Oral health is vital for force health protection. Failure to achieve a standard of oral health could preclude a soldier from deploying. Dental Readiness is a command responsibility. DoD established a uniform dental classification in HA Policy 02-11. DoD policy requires dental screening examinations to be accomplished and documented on 90% of service members. Members of the Army National Guard shall receive an annual dental screening examination to determine their dental classification. The results of that screening examination shall be entered into the DENCLASS database no later than 5 days from the date of examination. The DENCLASS database updates the Army Medical Protection System (MEDPROS). Dental treatment may be required as well, at certain times.

2. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:

The objective of this Statement of Work is to provide parameters and criteria for the conduct and completion of the Deployment requirements for Dental readiness including treatment for Alerted
          soldiers of the 27th BCT utilizing a mobile dental facility.   
                                                                                                                                                                          
         The requirements include:

•	Clinical evaluation of the oral cavity by a licensed dentist employing visual clinical exam supported by bitewing dental radiographs. Panographic dental radiographs must represent the Soldier’s current dental condition. Panographs are to be taken if there is no panograph in the record, if an existing panograph is greater than 10 years old, or if the Soldier has had major dental work since last panograph. Also the dentist may order a panograph if deemed clinically necessary to complete a proper dental exam. Radiographs will be taken by dental technicians. Existing adequate panographs that are analog images will be scanned electronically and uploaded into DENCLASS by the contractor.
•	Each exam will be entered into the DENCLASS reporting system within 24 hours of examination by ASM Research (ASMR) trained personnel, annotated on the Standard Form (SF) 603 (Health Record – Dental) and on the SF 5570 (Health Questionnaire for Dental Treatment) of the Soldier’s dental record.
•	Personnel performing the dental screening examination have a moral and ethical obligation to inform the Soldier if they observe or are apprised of any sign or symptom for which the Soldier should obtain further evaluation or care.
•	A dental screening examination identifies deficiencies.  Dental treatments required to correct those deficiencies to deployment standards are authorized.

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government’s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communication Requirements (SCR) Division, Webster Field Annex intends to procure Rack Ready Vehicular Platforms  for multiple programs which the SCR Division supports.   The Government intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements in accordance with the attached statement of work and solicitation.  The agreements will be in effect for a period of 5 years.  

Performance will take place CONUS.  There is a partial set aside for small business (see solicitation for details).  

All interested contractors/vendors should complete the RFP including all certifications contained in its provisions, and provide a proposal in the format specified in Section L.  Proposals are due by 2:00 P.M. Eastern February 3, 2010.

To be eligible to receive an agreement with the Federal Government, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) online at www.ccr.gov.

The government will not accept proposals submitted via e-mail.  The POC is Robert Battaglia, phone: 732-323-7535 or e-mail: robert.battaglia@navy.mil

Purpose of a BPA

It is the intent of the Contacting Office at Lakehurst NJ to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to qualified responsible contractors/vendors providing a basis for the award of delivery orders for its SCR’s requirements.  It is important to understand what a BPA is and what it will accomplish.  It is an agreement in which a contractor has been determined able to provide a particular product or class of products.  Upon receipt of a BPA, terms and conditions have been agreed to in advance for any delivery orders between the contract agency and the contractor.  Each BPA has a maximum dollar value assigned that represents only the potential dollar value; it is not a promise of total dollars awarded to any particular vendor.  For the Rack Ready Platform, that maxium value is 10 million dollars.  In addition, if that dollar value is reached with any one contractor, the contracting agency reserves the right to issue an additional BPA with that contractor, as well as award additional BPAs to qualified contractors at any time.

This solicitation meets the Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements for Synopsis (FAR 5.207 -- Preparation and Transmittal of Synopses).  After the BPAs are awarded, Request for Proposals/Quotes (RFPs) will be sent electronically to the qualified contractors for competition on either a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable or Best Value Basis, that basis provided in each individual RFP.   An additional advertisement will not be published for Delivery Orders (FAR 5.202 (11):  The proposed contract action is made under the terms of an existing contract that was previously synopsized in sufficient detail to comply with the requirements of FAR 5.207 with respect to the current proposed contract action)

The required information for potential contractor proposals will demonstrate their ability to meet the requirements of the individual Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  It is possible that a contractor will only be determined qualified to provide certain CLINs as opposed to the entire BPA as advertised.  There are certain CLINs set aside for small businesses as well.

The Price information is not binding on the contractor; it simply provides a basis for estimating future procurements.  While providing price information is a requirement for the proposal, there is no evaluation as to price reasonableness conducted.  BPA’s are reviewed annually as well, and during those annual reviews, updated price sheets will be requested.  Price becomes a factor only when an RFP is released for a delivery order.  At that time, competition will determine price reasonableness unless best value requirements specify otherwise.

There is not an order attached to the basic BPA itself, but it qualifies the contractor to compete for delivery order awards issued to holders of the BPAs.  These competitions are conducted in a compressed timeframe due to the immediacy of the requirement.  The process for the placement of delivery orders is spelled out in Section H of the RFP for the BPA.  

If you produce the items described in the Statement of Work, you are encouraged to submit a proposal as described in Section L.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Repair California Boulevard from Highway 1 to Utah Avenue / Modification 03<br />General: Restore Three Storm Drain Culverts / Re-line Three Culverts<br />Corrosion of the existing corrugated steel culvert pipes will lead to underground piping of the subgrade soils leading to erosion of the subgrade soils creating sinkholes or settling the new pavement. <br />This project is based on relining 3 culverts with HDPE Snap Tite Pipe. Once the liner has been installed and placed in a comfortable position to allow a good section for the slurry, then pressurized grout (slurry) will be applied in the void between the existing pipe and the liner to fill the void. With the installation of the liner it will require labors and masons working in the confined area of the drain inlet basin for the grout tie in, this will require safety measures for confined spaces and will consist of a certified safety monitor with proper PPE supplied for the confined space entry, ventilation fan, harness, safety man lift winch. Restore discharge opening areas by installing an energy dissipater at the discharge end of the culvert on the down stream side. Traffic control will be used during the concrete installation for the mixers and pump to stage. Coordination with service contracts for irrigation run off water will need scheduling.

<DESC>It is the Government's intent to negotiate on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Operation, Maintenance, and Repair of the Fort Rucker Gunnery Range Complex, Fort Rucker, Alabama, with the incumbent contractor, Honeywell Technology Solutions, Incorporated for an interim three-month period 1 January through 31 March 2010, with two one-month options if needed for 1-30 April and 1-31 May 2010, via contract modification to the existing contract DABK31-03-C-0001, in order to prevent a lapse in service. This extension has become necessary because of unanticipated delays in the pre-award process for the new competitive acquisition, which is currently issued competitively as W9124G-09-R-0002 and is extended indefinitely pending amendment and subsequent receipt of proposals. The contractor shall provide services to operate, maintain, and repair the Fort Rucker Gunnery Range Complex on a cost-plus-award-fee basis. This interim three-month period is anticipated to provide sufficient time to complete the competitive acquisition already underway. No solicitation documents exist at this time.

<DESC>The U.S&nbsp;Department of the Treasury (Treasury) would like to thank all of the interested parties that submitted capability statements in response to this Sources Sought Notice. Based on the analysis of the responses received, the Treasury has determined that this requirement shall be set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)&nbsp;concerns.<br /><br />The response date and time for this sources sought is not extended by this update.&nbsp;<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />This is a sources sought notice. This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) requires services to support the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) operations. These services include assistance responding to discovery requests, FOIA requests, requests for records from the Congressional Oversight Panel, Congressional Committees having oversight jurisdiction, and similar requestors. Although many Treasury documents contain sensitive data that must be protected from disclosure, a concurrent objective is to promote Treasury program transparency by making all records that can be totally or partially publicly released readily accessible via an on-line electronic reading room or similar methods.
<p>The requirement includes the following types of activities:</p>
<p>&bull; Examine case files to determine issues related to sufficiency of evidence and prepare documentation to support FOIA requests; <br />&bull; Prepare administrative documentation for active case files; <br />&bull; Apply legal precedents involving active case files; and <br />&bull; Examine and evaluate information in case files, for case litigation worthiness and appropriate legal citations.</p>
<p>Interested contractors should be familiar with processing procedures and laws pertaining to FOIA and have demonstrated experience in the field.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential interest and capabilities and qualifications of prospective offerors for this requirement. Treasury is particularly interested in understanding the capabilities and qualifications of interested small business concerns, including woman and minority-owned small businesses, and services-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to provide a written response to this notice which shall be limited to three pages. The response should include the following:</p>
<p>1. Vendor's name and address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address;</p>
<p>2. Vendor's small business size status, including whether the vendor is a woman-owned, minority-owned, hubzone or SDVOSB;</p>
<p>3. Whether the vendor is interested in working as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, or anticipates significant teaming arrangements; and</p>
<p>4. A description of the vendor's capabilities to meet some or all of the required services.</p>

<DESC>The type of Notice was improperly selected as "Sources Sought" and should have been "Combined Synopsis/Solicitation" instead. The original Notice was issued only to comply with Agency requirements to publisize American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funded requirements although the project will actually be awarded under an existing competitively awarded Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity type contract and is not being offered for competition at this time. Because there is no possibility of competition at this stage of the acquisition process, a revised Notice will not be issued.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.</p>
<p>This notice is amended with the following changes.<br /><br />The first paragraph is replaced with the following:<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS/QUOTES. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; ANY FORTHCOMING PROCUREMENT IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE WILL UTILIZE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDING.</p>
<p>The original specifications are deleted in&nbsp;their entirety and replaced as follows:<br /><br />The 600 MHz NMR spectrometer&nbsp;NIST seeks to acquire shall consist of:</p>
<p>Magnet console and software&nbsp;subsystem capabilities, with an operating frequency for 1H of 600 MHz, is sought which is comparable in capabilities to that outlined in detail&nbsp;below for the 900 MHz NMR system.&nbsp; A wide bore magnet will not be required.<br /><br />900 MHz NMR System</p>
<p>Requirements &amp; Specifications<br /><br />The system shall include magnet, console and software subsystems capable of operating at ~ 21.14 T (1H resonance frequency of 900 MHz). The system shall be capable of observing a wide range of NMR-active nuclei including, but not limited to, 1H, 2H, 13C, 31P, 15N, and acquiring one- and multi-dimensional spectral datasets. The system shall have the option to operate with cryogenic cooled, double and triple resonance (1H, 13C, and 2H coils &lsquo;cold') high resolution solution state probes, as well as standard room temperature probes. The system shall include pulse field gradients, as well as a gradient shimming capability. The system shall also have the capability to acquire data on samples in the solid state, using magic angle spinning (MAS) and static solid-state probe components.</p>
<p>In addition to the base 600&nbsp;MHz and/or&nbsp;900 MHz NMR system, optional components will be included in the requirements and specification. Depending on funds available at the time of purchase, such components may or may not be included in procurement of the NMR system. Since these options may be critical to NIST's future use of the NMR system, the sources responding to this notice should demonstrate that such options are available, are functional with the specified system, and can be retrofitted to the specified system in the future.</p>
<p>All other information remains unchanged.</p>

THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH, INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) PEO SUB seeks information as to potential qualified commercial sources with specific experience and expertise to replace the current Photonics Mast (PM) for VIRGINIA and SSGN Class Submarines. The new Photonics Mast Replacement (PMR) will have application to the Virginia Class and Ohio Class SSGN Class submarines with the potential for implementation on new design as well as 688/688i Class submarines. The PMR requirement is currently identified as an FY12 developmental new start with a planned FY16 initial production build. 
The PMR requirement is for a non hull penetrating optronics mast cited in a telescoping Universal Modular Mast (UMM) bay. Features shall include day and night infrared and visual imaging, laser range finding, special stealth features, and a capable antenna suite with broad spectral coverage and direction finding as well as potential for 360 degree Situational Awareness and Collision Avoidance imaging capability. The PMR shall support the existing Photonics Mast antenna suite which is currently planned to be an integrated component of the PMR.
As the Navy is seeking to attract and maximize the use of the existing industrial base we also seek information regarding technical risks/inhibitors that would be a limiter to effective future competition. Obtaining this information will allow the Navy to potentially implement risk mitigation initiatives early on in the process enabling the Navy to reach a broader technical community.

This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the United States Coast Guard’s (USCG) Technical Engineering Development Support Services Request for Proposal (RFP).  This procurement will be an 8(a) Set-aside.  

The USCG, Command and Control Center (C2CEN), located in Portsmouth, Virginia is seeking capable 8(a) certified small business sources or 8(a) joint ventures, including those with an approved SBA Mentor Protégé Agreement that can provide technical engineering development and support services.  Contract teaming is encouraged as prescribed under the SBA rules for Joint Ventures, Prime Contractor/Sub-Contractor arrangements, and the SBA’s Mentor-Protégé Program Procedures.

The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire technical engineering development and support services required to develop, integrate, deploy, enhance, and maintain new and existing USCG command, control, communications, computer, and information technology systems.  These systems are deployed on Coast Guard vessels and aircraft, unmanned facilities (i.e. Navigation Systems), and command centers located throughout the United States and the world.  C2CEN requires technical engineering support in the following five areas: (1) engineering development services necessary to build, implement and enhance command and control systems and communication systems; (2) systems requirements analysis necessary to derive requirements from the mission or business requirements provided by the Coast Guard; (3) integrated logistics support necessary to ensure C2CEN’s products and systems are fielded in the highest quality in terms of reliability, availability, maintainability, testability and supportability to include the wide variety of command and control systems and communication systems that are presently deployed or scheduled to be deployed; (4) system lifecycle operations and maintenance support and training services required to support current and future command and control systems and communication systems; (5) INFOSEC and Certification and Accreditation services required to obtain specified certifications; and (6) performance analysis support. This technical engineering support is necessary in order to provide the Coast Guard with integrated, responsive, and cost-effective command and control systems and communication systems required to support the USCG’s multiple mission objectives.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS POST-AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO ACCESS SYSTEMS, INC. FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of issuance of modification 0028 to Delivery Order 0001 of a previously competed contract (TIRNO-07-D-00004) that was awarded to Access Systems, Inc., a small business.  This purchase will provide additional Millions of Instructions Per Seconds (MIPS) through upgrades to our existing software licenses and maintenance through September 30, 2010.  The additional MIPS will support new workloads to the IRS mainframe environment.  The mainframe environment contains mission critical tax applications affected by the changes implemented by the ARRA.  These changes will result in increased workload volumes and changes that will require additional processing resources.  The increased workloads include processing new Business Master File tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems such as Corporate File Online.  This acquisition will provide the software licenses and maintenance for the additional processor capacity needed to process these workloads. The firm-fixed price modification award amount is $266,932.60.

GENERAL WORK REQUIREMENTS:  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, supervision, transportation and all else necessary to perform the following Task Order Scope of Work at Alamo Dam, Arizona.  The scope of this effort generally includes milling of the existing asphalt pavement, integration of the milled asphalt into the existing aggregate base course (ABC), grading and compaction of the milled asphalt/ABC, and paving with an asphalt concrete surface course.  The work area includes the Spillway Access Road, Nelson Road, and the driveway and parking area for the Dam Tenders Residence.  <BR><BR>This scope of work generalizes major work elements and is not all inclusive.  The Government will rely on the Contractor's expertise and experience to successfully execute this contract.<BR><BR>This Task Order Scope of Work shall be performed in accordance with the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications per your basic contract, Occupation Safety and Health Requirements (29 CFR 1910 and 1926), US Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1), and all applicable state and local codes.<BR><BR>2.  PROJECT INFORMATION: The following areas are planned for grading and paving under this task order:<BR><BR>2.1	Spillway Access Road: This road is approximately 3,170 feet in length, and the majority of this reach varies from approximately 24 to 26 feet in width. There is an approximately 300 foot long section that is approximately 32 feet wide between the control tower and the generator house. There is an approximately 250 foot long section that is approximately 10 feet wide between the end of the dam embankment and the spillway. The existing roadway pavement section is 2 inches of asphalt concrete over 4 inches of ABC. <BR><BR>2.2	Nelson Road: The portion of this road planned for paving is approximately 2,670 feet in length and 12 feet wide.  This road provides access from the Spillway Road to the base of the dam and gauging station.  The road has multiple switch backs and the grade is approximately 10-12%.  The existing roadway pavement section is 2 inches of asphalt concrete over 4 inches of ABC; although, this section is significantly deteriorated over the approximate lower third of this reach.<BR><BR>2.3 Driveway: The driveway is approximately 230 feet in length and 12 feet wide. The existing roadway pavement section is 2 inches of asphalt concrete over 4 inches of ABC.  <BR><BR>2.4 Parking Area: The parking area is delineated on the attached Detail 1. The thickness of the existing pavement section is unknown. The Corps of Engineers shall remove and fill the existing manhole located near the entrance to the Parking Area prior to Contractor starting work in this area. <BR>3.  CLIN 0001, GRADE AND PAVE ACCESS ROADS: Construct new asphalt concrete pavement surface for the Spillway Access Road, Nelson Road, Driveway, and Parking Area. <BR>3.1 Asphalt Pavement Section:  Pavement section shall be 2.5 inches of asphaltic concrete (AC) pavement over a minimum of 4 inches of milled asphalt/ABC.  The pavement section shall include a thickened edge constructed in accordance with Uniform Standard Details for Public Works Construction, Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG), Standard Detail No. 201, Type B. Asphalt concrete pavement materials shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, MAG Standard Specifications for Asphalt Concrete (Section 710,  inch, Marshal Mix).  Placement and testing requirements for the asphaltic concrete pavement should be in accordance with MAG Standard Specifications for Asphalt Concrete Pavement (Section 321). <BR><BR>3.2 Milling of Existing Asphalt Concrete Pavement and Base Preparation: The existing asphalt concrete pavement shall be milled to provide a well graded mixture with a maximum nominal particle size of  inch.  <BR><BR>The Spillway Access Road shall be milled to full width; however, only 22 feet of width shall be repaved (except for those areas specifically noted above as wider or narrower). Nelson Road shall be milled to full width and repaved to a 12 foot width. The Driveway shall be milled to full width and repaved to a 12 foot width with an approximate 15 foot radius on both sides of the connection point to Marina Road.  All existing pavement in the Parking Area shall be milled and the area repaved to the approximate limits shown on the attached Detail 1. Milling where paving extends below guard rails shall be as close as possible without damaging the guardrails. Pavement below or beyond the guardrail shall be left in place if undisturbed by milling. If it is loosened by the milling it shall be removed and disposed of by additional milling. <BR><BR>The milled asphalt concrete in the Spillway Access Road, Nelson Road, and the Driveway shall be integrated/mixed into the full depth of the existing ABC to provide a minimum 4 inch depth of base material. In the Parking Area, 4 inches of Aggregate Base Course (ABC) shall be placed after milling of the existing pavement.  ABC materials shall be in accordance with Uniform Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, MAG Standard Specifications for Base Materials (Section 702, Aggregate Base). Any excess subgrade materials shall be exported to the low spot on Nelson Road and used as subgrade fill, as described below. Drainage in the Parking Area is to be maintained to the existing central drain. All milled asphalt concrete/ABC shall be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent of the maximum dry density at a moisture content of optimum or lower as determined by ASTM D1557 (Modified Proctor). Testing of milled asphalt concrete/ABC for field density, field moisture content, and moisturedensity relationship shall be in accordance with US Army Corps of Engineers Construction Control Manual Pamphlet No. 415-1-2 with the test frequencies as described in Table 2.1-C, 1 and 3.<BR><BR>3.3 Grading and Subgrade Preparation: Grading shall generally be accomplished to the existing elevations and slopes or as shown on the attached Details 2 and 3. Grading shall include the removal of all existing surface vegetation and other organics, any fills and/or backfills, any disturbed soil, and any unstable (loose, soft, wet, etc.) soils, if encountered, from all proposed pavement areas.  All areas of excavation should be observed by a representative of the Corps of Engineers after clearing and during subsequent scarification to verify removal of all undesirable materials before any filling operations begin at the Site. Widen any resulting depressions as necessary to accommodate compaction equipment and provide a level base for placing fill.  Subsequent to the surface clearing and grubbing efforts, the exposed natural ground surface in those areas not currently covered with existing pavement should be prepared to a minimum depth of 6 inches below all proposed pavement areas.  Subgrade preparation shall include scarification, moisture conditioning (or aeration), and compaction.  Subgrade shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of the maximum dry density at a moisture content of 2 percent below optimum or lower as determined by ASTM D1557 (Modified Proctor).  Material testing shall be in accordance with US Army Corps of Engineers Construction Control Manual Pamphlet No. 415-1-2 with the subgrade test frequencies as described in Table 2.1-B, 1 and 3.<BR><BR>3.4 Drainage Improvements: The low spot identified along the Spillway Access Road just west of the access gate shall be filled after milling, such that a minimum slope of 1/2 of 1 % grade shall be maintained to a discharge point near the south west edge of the drainage where erosion was noted. Rough surveying indicates that fill will be required for a distance of approximately 80 feet to the west of the inlet location. A flaired end culvert and approximately 40 feet of 12-inch diameter corrugated metal pipe (CMP) pipe shall be placed for conveying runoff down the road embankment. A rolled asphalt berm shall extend approximately 150 feet from this discharge point going east along the south edge of the roadway. This berm shall be 4 to 6 inches higher than the edge of the road surface, and provide secure water passage to the inlet. A similar berm shall extend approximately 25 feet to the west to conduct water from the west into the inlet.  <BR><BR>To minimize import of material, the milled asphalt concrete and existing ABC from the low area should be salvaged by rolling to the edge or grading up station toward the dam for later spreading on the fill section. Subgrade fill and ABC shall be placed and compacted as described above.<BR><BR>At each end of the new fill section, a vertical curve will be required to transition from the two slopes. Surveying is not anticipated for this work, and the acceptance criteria will be pleasing to the visual eye and not an abrupt change in slope at 25 miles per hour.<BR><BR>3.5 Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan: The Contractor shall develop and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan in accordance with the requirements of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.<BR><BR>4.  CLIN 0002, AGGREGATE BASE FILL: Contractor shall provide a per ton price (based on full truck loads) to procure, load, transport, place, and compact ABC in the Parking Lot Area and in areas where following milling of the existing surface the milled asphalt concrete/ABC thickness/quality is deemed deficient by the Contracting Officers Representative.  An estimated quantity of 350 tons has been established for this item.  ABC materials shall be in accordance with Uniform Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, MAG Standard Specifications for Base Materials (Section 702, Aggregate Base). <BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY--Avian predation of migrating juvenile salmonids, particularly from gulls, is a common occurrence downstream of hydropower projects. In general terms, juvenile fish passing the dam may become disoriented due to a number of factors (acceleration, change in pressure, etc.) thereby becoming increasingly vulnerable to avian predation downstream of the dam.<BR><BR>An Avian Predation Deterrent Array (APDA) in the tailrace areas have been shown to significantly reduce avian predation rates on passing juvenile salmonids. The goal of the APDA is to provide a passive physical deterrent (wire coverage) over the entire tailrace area, from the face of the project downstream to the boat restricted zone (BRZ) to provide protection from avian predation, providing the juvenile salmonids time to recover before moving downstream. <BR><BR>Six array support structures (anchor poles) will be required. Three 40 ft anchor poles on the Oregon shore and three 90 ft anchor poles on navlock guidewall islands. Carrier lines will be installed between the anchor poles, to provide intermediate anchor points for the avian lines. Anchor pole and foundation design work will be required as part of the solicitation.<BR><BR>The typical span for a single wire will be approximately 2800 ft, while the longest span will approach 3100 ft. The avian lines will drape across the BRZ within 40 ft above normal high tailwater (minimal sag). <BR><BR>This will require in-water work with construction starting no earlier than 1 December 2009 and work completion no later than 15 March 2010.
