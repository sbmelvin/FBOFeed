<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC), including Design-Build capability, for U.S. Army Installations within Honshu, Japan, with 1-year basic period plus four (4) 1-year options. The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design-build capability. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks encompassing design-build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work such as, but not limited to, HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning), electrical, mechanical, architectural, and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order. Individual task orders may be as low as Y1,000,000, or may be well in excess of Y150,000,000; however most task orders will fall the range of Y5,000,000 to Y100,000,000 (Y stands for Japanese Yen currency). The estimated program value is Not-to-Exceed Y8,000,000,000 for a five-year period.
<p>The Government may award multiple contracts up to eight; however, the government reserves the right to award less than eight. The multiple contract awards will be made to offerors who provide the Government with the best value, using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) process in accordance with AFFARS 5315, and Mandatory Procedure (MP) 5315.305, paragraphs 5.5.2 and 5.6.2.1., and information Guide (IG) 5315.101-1, with evaluation factors to be included in the RFP consisting of: Technical Acceptability including Seed Project, Past Performance, and Price of Seed Project. The RFP will include a seed project, and award of the seed project at the time of contact award will satisfy the guaranteed minimum/Y500,000 for the MACC. All other successful awardees not receiving award of seed project at the time of contract award are guaranteed a minimum of Y500,000. The Government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees. The solicitation for MACC pre-announced here is expected in March 2011. The closing date and time for submission of offers as well as the date and time for pre-proposal conference will be contained in the solicitation package which will be made available only on Electric Posting System (EPS) single government point of entry (GPE) Web at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at the time.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>NOTE: Since the contemplating contract is to be awarded by the contracting activity located in Japan and to be performed in Japan, the offerors must meet the following two requirements OCONUS: (1) DFARS 252.252.225-7042, "Authorization to Perform" - The Offeror has been duly authorized to operate and to do business in the country or countries in which the contract is to be performed, and (2) FAR 52.236-7 (modified IAW AFFARS 5336.507), "Permits and Responsibilities" - The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any host government and political subdivisions laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.
