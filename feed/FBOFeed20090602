<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENTThis is a notice of intent of The Louis Stokes Cleveland, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44141 to negotiate a sole source BPA with POLYMEDCO Inc., a large business, for Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) testing. The following are the requirements determined by P&LMS (Pathology and Laboratory Medical Service)  for a new testing system:1)  Immunoassay Based Methodology - this methodology provides for more specificity with fecal occult blood testing thereby reducing false positive results (and in turn reducing colonoscopies).  2)  Fully Automated System - P&LMS receives and tests approximately 1500 fecal occult blood cards each month.  Fast turn- around-time is crucial to meet VHA performance measures.  3)  Connectivity - The automated system must be capable of interfacing with Vista for electronic transfer of patient results into the computer system.4)  Simple/Safe Sample Collection Device - The collection device should be simple and easy for the patients to use.  Compliance is a major issue with fecal occult blood testing.  A simple, clean collection device is essential.  Also, a collection device that does not require laboratory personnel to handle the specimen directly, improves safety in the laboratory.The proposed period of performance shall be from date of award,  thru September 30, 2009, with option years. The government believes that only one business can satisfy the agency requirements and intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b) - access to proprietary information. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by June 24, 2009. Such capabilities information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. No solicitation is available at this time.    All inquiries must be submitted by email to Harvey J. McGowan, Contract Specialist harvey.mcgowan@va.gov by no later then June 24, 2009 @ 12:00 P.M. (Noon Eastern Standard Time).

<DESC><p>The firm must have five (5) or more years experience of successful design &amp; manufacture of this type of WLS Fiber. Also, the firm must be able to produce, test &amp; ship 13,000 km of 0.7 mm diameter (WLS) Fiber (fully meeting Spec. requirements) over a 3 year period (10/09 - 9/12). The light generated in the Fiber must have an average Attenuation length of at least 12 m at a wavelength of 580 nm. Fiber is composed of a clear polystyrene core doped with a fluorescent dye and clad with a layer of PMMA and a layer of fluorinated polymer. The dye, K27 or equivalent, absorbs blue light entering the core and shifts the wavelength by &gt;75 nm from blue to yellow-green light. The dye has a high efficiency for conversion of the blue light and a low Attenuation for the green light. The two (2) free ends of the loop guide the transmitted light to the avalanche diode. The Fiber, whether bent or straight, must be resistant to damage by the liquid scintillator (cladding continuity is essential here) and maintain its light yield for at least 15 years.</p>

<SUBJECT>Advanced Horizon Reference System (AHRS)
<SOLNBR>N68335-09-R-0174
<RESPDATE>061509
<CONTACT>David Andreoli, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-5208, Fax 732-323-7440, Email david.andreoli@navy.mil - Barbara J Petrzilka, Contracting Officer, Phone 732-323-2067, Fax 732-323-7531, Email barbara.petrzilka@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure an Advanced Horizon Reference System (AHRS).  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing, refurbishment and delivery of the production representative model.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test a single production unit will be procured.  The Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of up to fifteen (15) systems along with spares. 

The AHRS program objective is the acquisition and initial support of a next generation AHRS that is intended to replace the A/W37A-1, the legacy Horizon Reference Set (HRS), for both forward and back-fit applications for all air capable ships with up-the-stern approaches.  The AHRS will provide a horizon reference which is independent of the ships rolling motion. The visual display will be a roll-stabilized, lighted reference bar to be located on top of the hangar or suitable structure forward of the operating area.  The AHRS will meet or exceed all of the performance requirements of the existing US Navy HRS and interface to legacy gyro systems using synchro formats as a well as an Ethernet-based system from the ships Navigation Sensor System Interface (NAVSSI). The AHRS will interface to the Aviation Lighting System Control Panel Set (ALS-CPS) being procured by the Government.  The AHRS will receive NAVSSI ship motion data and HCS operator communication via the ALS-CPS.

The AHRS program will involve designing, building, testing and refurbishing a production representative system in order to demonstrate conformance to the AHRS System Specification and the purchase of a production system.  The following constraints express the Navys desires for a form, fit replaceable system in order to reduce back-fit applications complexity and cost.  Suggestions for modifications to the System Specification may be provided for the Government for review in order to accomplish the overall Government objective of procurement of a modernized, affordable system that can be used for both forward and back-fit applications.

- For back-fit applications it is desired to have the next generation AHRS fit into the same footprint as the existing system and mount to the same foundations.  

The current horizon bar assembly mounts on a frame that has been shock qualified for the existing AHRS.  It is desired to retain this frame assembly; therefore the replacement AHRS should not exceed the weight of the existing system by more than 10%.  If the new system weight exceeds this parameter, the frame will require redesign and must be supplied as part of the next generation AHRS system.

It is also desired to utilize the existing cables to the maximum extent possible.  In particular, the legacy gyro cable is long and expensive to run so it should be reutilized, which will require the cable to enter the electronics cabinet in the same position as the existing cable.  If cables types must be changed it is desired that the cable sizes be the same or smaller so existing wire-ways and cable deck penetration tubes can be reutilized.  By keeping the same number of cable penetrations and keeping diameters consistent with existing cables, the install costs and required installation services can be minimized.

- If the vendor chooses to use components that exceed the current system size and weight the vendor should provide supporting data to show how this equipment can be mounted on existing ships while minimizing installation costs.

- The next generation AHRS should use 115 VAC, 60 Hz ships power.  The 400 Hz ship input should be used only for the synchro reference. 

- Components from the existing HRS may be reused in the proposed new design to the maximum practical extent.  However it is expected that only the boxes and structural parts will be retained.  The system technical manuals AD-400A1-MDB-000, AD-400A1-OMI-000 and AD-400A1-IPB-000 will be provided to the Contractor for reference as well as representative HRS drawings of the current system. If components are to be reused, the modification plans and the extent of reuse will be provided to the Government as part of the program proposal.

- It is desired to maintain one configuration for both forward and back-fit systems.  For systems that connect to the ships NAVSSI, navigation data will be received via an Ethernet connection from the ALS-CPS.  For systems that use synchro navigation data, a synchro card will be installed in the control cabinet for receiving ship motion data.  

Copies of the drawing package will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the drawing package is mailed.  If you have previously supplied a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, it is not required for you to resubmit.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a companys CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.

Award will be based on a determination of Best Value, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the drawing package shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.  Note that information to be provided is subject to export controls.  Please ensure a certified DD From 2345 is sent to NAVAIR Contracts with your request for performance parameters.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813312   NAICS Code: 813312   The US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air and Radiation, Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) plans to award a Sole Source purchase order to BioDiversity Research Institute (BRI) under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13: SimplifiedAcquisitions under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1). CAMD has a requirement for analytical services to assess monitored datasets of mercury concentrations in environmental media from sites across the nation. Specifically, these include mercury data on wildlife, such as loons and other piscivorus birds, songbirds and mammals. The main services rendered to EPA under this contract are the compilation of mercury monitoring datasets, development of a documented, standardized, searchable, geo-referenced electronic database, and the assessment of thresholds, patterns, trends and gaps in the data.
CAMD requires this database of mercury concentrations in wildlife to develop a baseline mercury record for tracking the efficacy of federal and state mercury air rules over time and for characterizing the wildlife mercury monitoring density/coverage needed to establish a future, integrated mercury monitoring network (e.g. air, water, sediments, fish, wildlife).
The BioDiversity Research Institute (BRI) is uniquely qualified to conduct the work required for standardizing and assessing wildlife mercury data. The BRI is the preeminent scientific organization for cutting-edge research on the effects of mercury on wildlife. Through their research and monitoring efforts on avian and mammalian indicators of ecosystem response to mercury inputs, they have acquired more than 85 datasets representing >350,000 datapoints from more than 40 states across the U.S. and globally. While some of the data collected in these states are available in governmental reports and peer-reviewed papers, much of the data are only available through direct access with BRI. BRI is the sole entity that houses these data. No other agencies, company or organization has direct access to BRI's mercury database. The scientists at BRI are nationally and internationally recognized as experts in wildlife biology, and particularly with their work on mercury in birds (loons) and mammals. Dr. David Evers, the Executive Director of BRI and Principle Investigator for this project, has more than 30 peer reviewed scientific journal articles published on avian ecotoxicology.  BRI, under the leadership of Dr. Evers, has the unique data and approaches, including experience in performing these types of environmental mercury assessments to support the needs of CAMD.
Due to the nature of this procurement EPA believes there is only one responsible source capable of meeting these requirements. No solicitation or Request for Quotes is available. Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting these requirements may submit a response, which is received by COB, Friday, June 12, 2009, will be considered. Responses must be submitted in writing via the email link below. No telephone calls will be accepted. The point of contact for this procurement is Nicole Schuller, Contracting Officer, at schuller.nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511210   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Ingenuity Systems, 1700 Seaport Blvd. Redwood City, CA 94063 for the renewal of two(2)Ingenuity Pathways Analysis concurrent licensefor one year with unlimited user accounts. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software is a web-based application that enables researchers to explore, understand, and discover relevant networks significant to their research results. Using a researcher's gene or protein dataset in combination with Ingenuity's genome-scale knowledge base, the application generates multiple biologic networks with an associated functional analysis to facilitate biological understanding of the dataset. Specifically it: A. supports genomic and proteomic data analysis; B. enables discovery of novel genes, proteins and interactions (canonical) pathways; C. allows expansion of pathways to identify putative targets; D. contains manually curated pathways from full-text scientific literature (Not just abstracts); E. allows comparisons of 2 groups of pathways; F. allows user creation of a pathway from a set of genes; G. develops pathways from an input genelist on the "fly", meaning it develops a pathway from just that set of genes and no others. This is a unique Pathway Analysis software that allows researchers to view their data in terms of networks of pathways in an "interactomic fashion". There are no pathways analysis packages on the market today that contains the depth of annotated pathways as provided by Ingenuity Pathway Software. This software is presently being used to support an ongoing research project at EPA. As such, it is required for continuity of data analyses for the project.

<DESC>BARDA - Strategic and Technology Science Division
Broad Agency Announcement Synopsis Notice 

Science and Technology Platforms Applied to Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Development

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies. BARDAs mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN), in support of the preparedness mission and priorities of the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) articulated in the PHEMCE Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.  The Implementation Plan for CBRN agents is located on the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) website http://www.hhs.gov/aspr/barda/phemc/index.html and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza on the website http://www.pandemicflu.gov.

The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act (PAHPA) directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist countermeasure and product advanced research and development, (ii) research on and development of research tools and other devices and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives.  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), BARDA seeks to advance the technological and scientific advancements of medical countermeasures for biodefense CBRN and emerging infectious disease threats, including pandemic influenza.  The PAHPA is located on the ASPR website http://www.hhs.gov/aspr/opsp/pahpa/index.html.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is specifically designed to promote science and technology advancements of platforms applied to MCM development for the Strategic Science and Technology Division (SSTD) of BARDA and will be open to all responsible Offerors.  Specific instructions on the preparation and submittal of offers and administrative actions will be published in the BAA expected to be released on or about 15 June 2009.  The Governments intent is to solicit potential advancements in science and technology in the following BARDA SSTD Areas of Interest:   

1.	Technologies to accelerate evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.

2.	Formulation chemistry, protein stabilization, and vaccine delivery technologies as applied to products in advanced stages of development or to licensed products. 

3.	Innovative methods in bioprocess development and manufacturing. 

4.	Methods and technologies to advance development of diagnostic tests for the rapid diagnosis of human infections.

The BARDA SSTD Areas of Interest are designed to target platform technologies focused on (1) product development improvements to enhance the safety, efficacy, and ease of use of MCM, (2) reducing time and cost of MCM development, evaluation, and manufacturing, and (3) advanced development of innovative diagnostic platforms for the rapid detection of priority pathogens.  The specific application of the technologies will focus on biodefense (CBRN agents) and emerging infectious disease (EID) threats, including pandemic flu, particularly as applied to candidate products in late stages of product development.  BARDA anticipates that demonstration of the utility of these novel platforms in biodefense and EID generating validated data suitable for analysis of candidate products and have direct application to commercial-scale manufacturing or testing processes.  The development activities should be fully integrated with regulatory activities associated with product development efforts. 

BARDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts and/or cooperative agreements for research and development efforts from this BAA that have sufficient potential for success; are of interest to the Government; and support one or more of the listed BARDA SSTD Areas of Interest.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Diaabetes Treatment and Prevention intends to solicit for offers for healthcare improvement consultant services.  Required services include but are not limited to harvesting the knowledge gained and lessons learned from Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) 333 community directed grants programs and 66 demonstration programs;  collaborating on the development of documents to guide SDPI work in the area of continous quality improvement and measurement for improvement; providing guidance and assistance in the development of measures; assisting in the development of learning communities and resource centers to enhance Best Practice utilization and evaluation by SDPI grantees; incorporating improvement principles into future Request For Application (RFA) processes; and developing tools and training resources to enhance the success of future SDPI applicants.

An interested organization should be a healthcare improvement organization with partnerships in academia.  An interested organization must have researched and proven improvement tools that reduce adverse patient care events, improve clinical outcomes, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and improve healthcare financial performance.  An interested organization must currently be providing quality improvement training to healthcare professionals nationally through a variety of methods such as conferences and web based continuing medical education.  Interested parties will be evaluated on experience that includes working with American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities and the Indian Health Service, Tribal, & Urban programs (ITU) healthcare system such as, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), Clinical Reporting System (CRS), and iCare.  More information is available at the IHS website:  www.ihs.gov.

Background:

The mission of the IHS Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) is to develop, document and sustain a public health effort to prevent and control diabetes and related chronic diseases in AIAN people and communities. The DDTP employs collaborative strategies in the 12 IHS Areas through coordination of a network of Area Diabetes Consultants, model diabetes programs, and ITU SDPI grant programs. In addition, the DDTP is the primary point of contact for inter-agency and well as intra-agency communication on the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related chronic diseases in AIAN communities.

The Special Diabetes Program for Indians is a $150 Million grant program that is administered by the DDTP. The program addresses the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes and its related complications in AIAN communities. Over 300 ITU non-competitive grant programs have been funded through the SDPI grant program annually since 1998. In addition, 66 competitive grant programs have been funded annually since 2004 to address prevention of Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease risk reduction. SDPI is currently authorized through FY2011.  The IHS Director has expressed his desire to Tribal Leadership that this SDPI project align itself more closely with the Chronic Care Initiative (CCI) in incorporating improvement principles and practices into grantee activities for the prevention and treatment of diabetes in AIAN communities.
 
The CCI grew out of the work done by the IHS DDTP over the past 3 decades. For the past three years, DDTP has worked closely with the CCI leaders.  Having observed the value of CCIs integration of improvement principles into strategy and processes, the DDTP has made a commitment to incorporate improvement into SDPI plans for 2009 and beyond.  Doing this will build on a very successful program and accelerate its progress and outcomes, resulting in improved diabetes care and prevention in Native communities.

General Tasks in the Statement of Work:

1.	Capture knowledge gained from SDPI grantees over the past 12 years
2.	Provide guidance and assistance in the integration of improvement principles in DDTP/SDPI work
3.	Assist in the development of  SDPI Learning Communities and SDPI Resource Centers
4.	Provide guidance and assistance with SDPI Request for Application 
5.	Develop improvement tools and training resources

This procurement is offered for full and open competition and being solicited under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations.  The period of performance shall be for one base year plus two 12-month option periods.   It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price Contract will be awarded. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720 and 611430, with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. The solicitation will be available on or about June 16, 2009, with a tentative closing date of July 15, 2009.

<DESC><BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK<BR>17 May 2009<BR><BR><BR>1.	 LOCATION:  Whittier Narrows Dam, South El Monte, Los Angeles County, California.<BR><BR>2.	 ITEM:  Remote Groundwater Level Monitoring at Whittier Narrows Dam<BR><BR>3.	BACKGROUND AND LOCATION:  <BR><BR>	a.  Whittier Narrows Dam is a flood control embankment located in Southern California approximately 13 miles east of downtown Los Angeles (N34.0213, E118.0703).  As such, the dam is in a highly urbanized area and is readily accessible via major freeways and surface streets.  The earthen embankment dam is founded on deep alluvial deposits and does not have a positive cutoff, therefore seepage under and through the embankment is anticipated in the design.  Water is impounded infrequently in the reservoir only after storm events and is released in a regulated manner to facilitate groundwater recharge within and downstream from the reservoir while minimizing uncontrolled seepage downstream and maintaining a high level of dam safety.  As a part of the design, a series of 50-foot deep, 8-inch diameter relief wells are located at the downstream toe of the dam on a 50 to 100-foot spacing.  Groundwater levels typically vary between 10 and 30-feet below ground surface (bgs) under the central portion of the 3-mile long embankment but may rise as high as 2 feet bgs in the relief wells (the top of a lateral pipe connection to a toe drain from the relief well casing is at a depth of 2-feet).  Because of the relatively coarse, pervious nature of the foundation materials, groundwater under the dam reacts rapidly to reservoir impoundment and in select locations at the downstream toe can be expressed at the ground surface and create surface ponding.  Therefore, groundwater levels are a critical to the operation of the dam when water is being maintained in the reservoir.  At the present time, groundwater levels must be monitored manually by sounding a few of the 141 relief wells during rain events or reservoir impoundment. <BR><BR>	b.  Because of the dams close proximity to a highly urbanized area, the location of the relief wells is easily accessible to both authorized and un-authorized persons.  Therefore, vandalism of structures and equipment is a constant threat.  <BR><BR>	c.  As a part of a currently on-going dam safety assessment for Whittier Narrows Dam, it is anticipated that additional seepage control measures such as gravel drains and berms may be constructed within several years at the downstream toe of at least a portion of the central embankment (between Rosemead Blvd. and the San Gabriel River spillway).  This construction would be in the area of the existing relief wells.<BR>	<BR>	d.  Currently, the Los Angeles District Reservoir Regulation Section maintains web-based data on reservoir levels, inflow and outflow volumes, and precipitation for all dams in the District . (http://www.spl.usace.army.mil/resreg/)  At Whittier Narrows Dam, this data is telemetered via line-of-sight transmission for both the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River drainages from transmitters at control houses on the top of each end of the embankment.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>4.	PURPOSE OF WORK:  The purpose of remotely monitoring groundwater levels at Whittier Narrows dam is threefold:  <BR><BR>	a.  Prior to construction of any additional seepage control measures, real-time groundwater levels would allow optimum assessment of conditions relating to safe and efficient operation of the dam during storm events.<BR><BR>	b.  Remote sampling of groundwater level data would provide valuable data relating to the response of groundwater levels to reservoir surface elevations.  This data could be useful in optimizing the design of additional seepage control measures.<BR><BR>	c.  After construction of any additional seepage control measures, real-time measurements of groundwater levels at the downstream toe could be used to assess the effectiveness and operation of the system.<BR><BR>5.	SERVICES REQUIRED: <BR>	a.  Install pressure transducers or piezometers to measure groundwater levels at three locations at the downstream toe of the dam.  Existing relief wells may be used for installation or new, cased holes constructed for that purpose.  The locations shall be in the areas as follows:<BR><BR>Area<BR>Designation	Stations within Area	Relief Wells<BR>in Area	Total<BR>Depth<BR>	From	To		<BR>1	56+80		72	t.d. 47.0<BR>		59+00	74	t.d. 49.0<BR>2	65+60		80	t.d. 45.0<BR>			81	t.d. 47.8<BR>			82	t.d. 49.0<BR>		67+65	83	t.d. 48.0<BR>3	81+35		97	t.d. 48.5<BR>			98	t.d. 49.5<BR>			99	t.d. 49.5<BR>		84+45	100	t.d. 48.9<BR><BR>	b.  Install data logger for each pressure transducer capable of data transmission to a remote site (radio, cell phone, GOES, etc.).<BR><BR>	c.  Provide necessary power for each installation (hard wired, solar panel, rechargeable battery, etc.).<BR><BR>	d.  Construct site security for each site (chain link fencing, instrument house, buried equipment enclosure, etc.).<BR><BR>	e.  Provide hardware and software as necessary to access data from remote computers.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>6.	PERIOD OF SERVICE:	The work and services in the time allowed as follows:<BR><BR>Complete installation of hardware:  60 calendar days after written notification of purchase order award.<BR><BR>Successful data transmission and remote download:  90 calendar days after written notification of purchase order award.<BR><BR><BR>7.	ITEMS AND DATA TO BE FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT:  <BR><BR>The Government shall make available to the contractor relevant information from related studies, design memorandums, and other pertinent data available in its files which may contribute to the preparation of the project, including the following:<BR><BR>Relief Well Pumping Test Data Report  Whittier Narrows Dam prepared for USACE Los Angeles by AMEC Geomatrix, Inc., 2009.<BR><BR>A visit to the project site will be arranged, date TBD<BR><BR>8.	OTHER REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall prepare a project schedule and coordinate all aspects of the work prior to execution with project manager David Lukesh, USACE Los Angeles District Geotechnical Branch, (213) 452-3595.<BR><BR><BR>9.	PAYMENT FOR WORK AND SERVICES:  The Government will award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order.  The agreed upon awarded price shall constitute full compensation by the Government to the contractor for the work and services performed under this Scope of work.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W912EF-07-D-0003-0004.<br><br>The Dworshak Fish Hatchery located near Orofino, Idaho is owned by the Walla Walla District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Nez Perce Tribe.  The hatchery raises approximately 2.0 million steelhead smolts annually to release in the Clearwater River as part of the COE Dworshak Dam mitigation program.  The hatchery also participates in the Lower Snake River Compensation Plan, raising approximately 1.0 million Chinook salmon smolts for the North Fork River each year.  Additionally, 280,000 Coho salmon smolts are raised as part of a cooperative program with the Nez Perce Tribe and 15,000 rainbow trout are raised for outreach activities.<BR><BR>The Dworshak Fish Hatchery has a total of 84 concrete Burrows Ponds arranged into three different systems.  Each system has the infrastructure and equipment for operation under water reuse configuration.  The Burrows Ponds in System I were constructed for reuse during the initial hatchery construction and reuse equipment was added in System II and III during the second phase of construction.  In system I and II, Burrows pond effluent is collected in one of two concrete effluent drain channels that run perpendicular to the ponds, one channel drains directly to the river and the other transfers pond effluent to the corresponding systems reuse treatment equipment.  System III effluent can be directed to either the systems channel pump sump for reuse operation or to the River for discharge. Dworshak Fish Hatchery cannot utilize the reuse system because of water quality issues.  When the reuse system is utilized, water quality decreases and fish mortality increases.<BR><BR>Dworshak Fish Hatchery has 30 raceways arranged in 2 banks.  The majority of effluent exits the hatchery via the fish ladder.  Cleaning effluent can be diverted to a sump and then pumped to the settling basin and out to the North Fork Clearwater River.  The hatchery has 128 small nursery tanks in the nursery room.  Nursery tank effluent is always treated in one of two full-flow clarifying basins that are part of the System I Burrows Pond reuse system.<BR><BR>Dworshak Fish Hatchery currently discharges the majority of hatchery effluent directly to either the North Fork of the Clearwater River or the Clearwater River with minimal or no effluent treatment.  There are a total of 20 discharge locations from the hatchery (7 outfalls to the North Fork and 13 outfalls to the main stem of the Clearwater), although many of them are storm drains or overflows that do not come into contact with fish rearing environments or do not discharge on a continuous basis.  Nursery tank effluent is always treated in one of two full-flow clarifying basins.  When not operated in reuse, effluent from ponds in Systems I and II is discharged directly to the Clearwater or North Fork Rivers.  System I Burrows pond effluent is only treated in the systems clarifying basins during water reuse operation.  Fish typically experience poor health during the time the reuse systems are being operated, particularly fish in Systems II and III.  System III is no longer operated in reuse configuration due to the extensive decline in fish health during reuse operation.<BR><BR>Discharge permits in the state of Idaho are issued through the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Dworshak Fish Hatchery currently operates under discharge Permit #IDG131003 within the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), General Permit #IDG131000 for Cold Water Aquaculture Facilities in Idaho without wasteload allocations.  In December 2008, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq to the FWS for violating their General Aquaculture NPDES permit.  The two primary violations were the discharge of untreated cleaning wastewater and that the Dworshak Fish Hatchery lacked the means to measure flow.<BR><BR>If an aquaculture wastewater treatment facility in Idaho needs to be changed or modified, the director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) must approve the plan prior to construction or modification.  The DEQ must also be notified when the project is complete so that a representative from the DEQ can conduct onsite inspection of the completed project to ensure compliance with the approved plans and specifications.<BR>

Cameroon: Limb Gas to Electricity Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Cameroon Ministry of Energy and Water Resources.
Cameroon: Limb Gas to Electricity Technical Assistance

The Government of Cameroon considers power shortages to be one of the key constraints to its economic growth. The nation has an installed production capacity of 935 MW but the countrys effectively functioning productive capacity is, at present, only 450 MW. This shortfall is caused by various factors including: reliance on aged facilities and equipment, the effect of harsh climatic conditions, and a lack of long term maintenance. The performance of the power sector since 2001 has been disappointing, as severe droughts have limited the supply of water, which is the source of 90 percent of the electric power produced in Cameroon. To guard against outages in the dry season, Cameroon must decrease its dependency on hydropower through diversification of its power supply.

Like other oil-producing countries in the region, Cameroon previously focused on oil production and flared unused associated gas.  While exploring for crude oil, several off-shore gas fields were found in Cameroon.  Some of these fields remained undeveloped because at the time they offered little potential for commercial development. Among those fields is the off-shore Isongo Marine Gas Field, located 35 km from the coastal city of Limb on the northern coast of Cameroon.  Intensified seismic surveying and exploratory drilling have discovered several other fields near the Isongo Marine Field, including the Isongo C, D, E, and F Fields. Two of these fields, Isongo E and F, are being considered for development as a source of fuel for the 400 MW Limb power plant.  The permit for these fields is held by EurOil Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the international oil company BowLeven Plc., and EurOil would supply the feedstock to fuel the Limb power plant.  The initial off-taker would be the Government of Cameroon, though the transmission system will be licensed to a regulated monopoly under the Governments ongoing policy to create competition in the sector.  
	
The overall project involves a series of major interdependent investment projects that will have to be balanced as to production, throughput, consumption volumes, and long-term price commitments. The Limb power plant plans call for a total plant capacity of 400 MW, which would include the conversion to natural gas of an existing 85 MW heavy- fuel-oil-fired reciprocating power plant and the addition, at the same site, of 315 MW of new-plant capacity. The new construction will be a combined-cycle, gas-fired plant built in two or three phases (depending on plant configuration) taking into consideration the immediacy of need, capacity, load balancing in a fragile transmission system, and cost. The Limb power plant is currently connected to the southern grid through a 15 km 90 KV transmission line, which does not have the capability to accommodate output from a 400 MW power plant. Reinforcement by a second 90 KV line to the network and the construction of a 60 km 225 KV line to Douala, plus requisite transformers, ancillary control, and protection equipment are part of the Limb Gas to Electricity Project. These additions would enable delivery of power to the commercial center of Cameroon. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $695,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. on July 24, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AAC - Air Armament Center, 691st ARSS, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 622, Building 349, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6008</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 728th Armament Systems Group, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracting Office, Eglin AFB FL is planning to procure spare components in support of the BQM-167 Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) program in 4th quarter FY09. AFSATs are used by the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) to test and evaluate air-to-air and surface-to-air weapon systems. The Air Force currently procures the BQM-167A target, produced by Composite Engineering Inc. (CEi), to meet this need. The Government does not own a technical data package for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.<br />Schedule is critical for the procurement and delivery of spares, and any potential source must be able to deliver these items within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements. Potential sources must be capable of providing all the spare items required (~400 unique items in total), not a subset. The Government plans to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in FY10 that will extend through FY15, and issue delivery orders on a quarterly basis to meet ongoing spares requirements. Spare components to be procured include, but are not limited, to the following:<br />CEi P/N DESCRIPTION LEAD TIME<br />1C700-107 Structural Assy, Electronics Bay Cover 7 mos<br />1F200-101 Structural Assy, Empennage 7 mos<br />1F341-101 Sequencer, ALE-47 (Modified) 7 mos<br />1L301-101 Canopy, Drogue Assembly 7 mos<br />1L307-101 Canopy, Main Assembly 7 mos<br />1E420-9 SENSOR_VDOPS_ENCRYPTION_ESP 7 mos<br />1C220-101 Structural Assy, Fuselage 8 mos<br />1C300-101 Assy, Empennage 8 mos<br />1E455-1 Autopilot Sensor 8 mos<br />1C600-101 Assy,Outboard Wing,RH 9 mos<br />1C600-102 Assy,Outboard Wing,LH 9 mos<br />1E474-101 Electrical Assy, Power Conditioning Unit 10 mos<br />1E460-1 Transponder, GRDCS 11 mos<br />1E480-1 Transponder, L-Band (IFF) 11 mos<br />1E470-3 Integrated Flight Controller 11 mos<br />1C400-501 Engine, TRI60-5+ 12 mos<br />1J001-3 Engine Control Unit 12 mos<br />Potential offerors who are capable of meeting the Air Force's spare requirements and delivery schedules outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The offeror's SOC shall clearly demonstrate that: (1) it is capable of producing the spare components listed above within the delivery lead times specified; (2) the delivered spare components are produced in compliance with "International Standard ISO 9001, Quality Management Systems Requirements; and (3) spare components delivered will meet form, fit, and performance requirements for physical and functional compatibility with the BQM-167 aerial target system to include target and associated support equipment. The SOC shall be limited to 25 pages including attachments. Responses are requested by 17 June 2009.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this&nbsp;effort is to obtain hardware and engineering services in support of the Air National Guard (ANG) Block 30 F-16 Advanced Identity Friend/Foe (AIFF) program. This effort supports current and future installation phases of the program, which will allow for installation of 100+ systems on ANG aircraft.
<p>The ANG has selected the AN/APX-113-56 Combined Interrogator/Transponder (CIT) AIFF system for their fleet of Block 25/30/32 C-model F-16 aircraft. To date, 81 ANG aircraft have been modified with the -56 AIFF system. Current funding will allow for fielding of approximately 100 additional systems, with expected future funding for additional installations within the next three years.</p>
<p>AIFF is a critical system for the ANG ASA mission of national security, reducing fratricide and pilot workload while increasing pilot situational awareness. The ANG AIFF program has been funded with a combination of Defense Emergency Response Funds (DERF), Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Congressional Plus-up sources of funding.<br />AIFF was initially fielded with Software Capabilities Update (SCU) 6 in November 2007. Group A and B Hardware kits are fully qualified and have been flying on ANG F-16 aircraft</p>

<DESC>Amendment to Sources Sought 09-006S - New response time - June 10, 2009
This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (Dredging).    The small business size standard for NAICS Code 237990 is $20 million. 
The purpose of the proposed project is for a Contractor to furnish all of the labor, dredge, support equipment, materials, and incidentals necessary for the performance of maintenance dredging along the overflow weir from the headworks of the All American Canal and north along the Colorado River channel for a distance of approximately 3,000 feet, approximately 2,100 feet along the face of the dam and weir, and approximately 1,200 feet north up the secondary river channel above the Gila Sluiceway adjacent to Hidden Shores (formerly Imperial Oasis) on the Arizona side of the river channel.     
In addition to affecting the ability to store sluicing flows, sediment deposition above Imperial Dam has resulted in nuisance vegetation growth near hydraulic features, which compromise the operational function of the reservoir and the structural integrity of the Dam, including features of historical value. 
Depending upon the availability of funding, Reclamation will also require the maintenance dredging of the Laguna Settling Basin.  The Laguna Basin dredging will be an executable option to the Imperial Dredging requirement.
It should be noted, the dredge and associated equipment are required to operate over a large temperature variation.  Ambient air temperatures can range from the lower 30's during the winter months to highs of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months (June through September).
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin November 6, 2009 with an anticipated completion date of November 1, 2010. 
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Wendy Williams at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than 10 June, 2009.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Wendy Williams/LC-3113, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail wwilliams@usbr.gov.  
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

The project title:  Reviewer Education in State of the Art Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Background:
A goal of Office of Pharmaceutical Science is to help establish common approaches to the manufacture and formulation of drugs among pharmaceutical manufacturers.  OPS is an umbrella organization over the activities of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) review (also referred to as the Product Quality Review) in CDER.  This includes assessment of product and process design and evaluation of product quality in light of established standards and setting and maintaining new quality standards.  The level of assessment required by OPS Staff is becoming more challenging as the Agency begins to see the submission of novel and complex dosage forms resulting in added complexity in science-based regulatory decision making.
OPS oversees the review process for CDERs New Drug (NDA) and Abbreviated New Drug Applications as well as Investigational New Appliations (INDs) and some Biologic License Applications (BLAs) which is conducted by the Offices of New Drug Quality Assessment, Generic Drugs, and Biotechnology Products with support from the Office of Testing and Research and the Immediate Office.  
The staff working in these programs has backgrounds in chemistry, biology, biopharmaceutics, clinical pharmacology, immunology, pharmaceutical science, microbiology, pharmacology/toxicology, labeling and statistics.  
OPS is faced with the challenge to ensure that the entire staff attains the necessary level of understanding across the various technical and scientific elements of the product assessment.  Further, OPS engages in scientific research to support decision making for application review, standard setting, and for technology development which establishes an expectation and requirement in awareness and understanding of current pharmaceutical and manufacturing science .
Purpose
The purpose of this contract is to deliver a professional development program to ensure reviewers are current in state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing and technology.   Accomplishing this objective requires delivery of a well-structured educational program based on the needs of OPS staff that review and evaluate the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (i.e., CMC or product quality information) for Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs), New Drug Applications (NDAs), Biologic License Applications (BLAs), and Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs).
Project Requirement
The delivery of contractor services and products to CDER should contribute directly to the accomplishment of expectations in the following task areas:

	Providing recommendations for a structured professional development program in state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing and technology
	Identifying the needs and competencies of OPS staff who review or contribute to the scientific assessments of INDs, NDAs, BLAs, and ANDAs
	Designing the scientific training program based on the needs of the CDER review programs and knowledge requirements for state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing and technology
	Developing goals and objectives for a professional development program based on the reviewers' needs and competencies,
	Delivering the professional development program, 
	Evaluating the training program to ensure it met the stated goals and objectives, and
	Identifying a designated project manager to facilitate the contract goals, objectives, timelines, and resource management.

<a href="mailto:lorna.tribby@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
The NAVY is seeking inputs from parties interested in supplying a power source with a high energy density, for manned US Navy wet-submersibles. Any suitable power source, such as batteries, fuel cells, etc. will be considered.  The power systems are managed by Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane).  Attachment 1 provides specific requirements for the proposed power system.  Interested parties shall submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper") following format outlined in attachment 1.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically to the NSWC Crane Contracting Office point of contact below NLT 1159 PM EST 6/19/2009. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.
White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of this announcement.  The following point of contact is provided for information regarding technical issues: Mr. Joe Bailey, email joseph.p.bailey1@navy.mil , phone 812-854-1665 or Larry West larry.m.west@navy.mil, phone 850-766-7056.  NSWC Crane Contracting Office Point of Contact is Lorna Tribby, email lorna.tribby@navy.mil, phone 812-854-6021. Please refer to announcement number N00164-09-R-GS51 in all correspondence and communications. ATTACHMENT 1 BACKGROUND: Rechargeable silver zinc batteries, as well as lithium ion batteries have been used for similar submersibles in the past.  However, this RFI is not intended to limit interested parties from considering and proposing other chemistries and technologies.  With rapid technological advances in engineering, manufacturers may well exceed current power density and configuration requirements.  Deviations from the specification that would enhance or improve desirable characteristics of the power system are encouraged.  In addition to the power source itself, a power management system is required.For planning purposes, anticipate delivery of prototype power system and ancillary support equipment in fiscal year 2012. 1.  Specific energy should have a minimum threshold of 0.15 kWhr per kilogram with an objective of 0.19 kWhr per kilogram at the lowest replaceable unit (LRU) level, and shall be configured to fit within additional power system packaging.  Energy density should have a minimum threshold of 0.3 kWhr/Liter with an objective of .4 kWhr/Liter at the LRU level.
2.  The power source should be modular in nature with the ability to connect or disconnect additional identical power sources for scalability to smaller or larger platforms such that varying mission requirements can be met with the appropriately sized power source.
3.  The power source will be housed inside pressure vessels within a manned compartment. The pressure vessels will not be provided as part of the power source; a separate entity will design and fabricate the vessels.  This RFI does not need to focus on the pressure vessel (or other packaging methods) only that the power source will be housed within one. Pressure vessels will see pressures of approximately 200' of seawater. Power source pressure proof packaging options that will optimize the overall package weight and volumetric power density are encouraged.  Examples of this include pressure compensated or inherently pressure proof systems.
4.  The proposed technology for the power source shall have a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or greater in accordance with DOD 5000.
5. The power system must have capability of being charged in place, without removal or modification of any portion of the power system or submersible. Submersible must be able to be recharged prior to, and after diving evolutions without removal of any portion of the power system. 
6.  Operating conditions in water will be from 32oF to 100oF, and air storage temperatures will be from -30oF to 140oF.

Background:

As part of its mission to protect the public health and safety, and the environment, the NRC conducts routine and special inspections of sites to be decommissioned.  During these inspections, samples are collected to determine the radiological status and provide an independent verification of the radiological condition of the site.  

In addition to routine and special inspections, the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E, and related criteria applicable to the decommissioning of facilities licensed under Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, and 72 (as well as other facilities subject to the Commissions jurisdiction) require NRC licensees to submit a License Termination Plan (LTP) or Decommissioning Plan (DP) to demonstrate compliance with the radiological criteria for license termination.  In making the determination that the supporting documentation and the final radiation survey demonstrate that the site is suitable for release, NRC staff conducts: 1) technical reviews of all decommissioning-related documents; 2) in-process inspections to verify the adequacy of decommissioning activities; and 3) confirmatory surveys to validate the final radiation survey.  In order to accomplish these tasks, contractor assistance is required to provide survey instrumentation and laboratory analysis capabilities that are otherwise not available in-house to NRC staff and to augment the NRC staff's technical expertise.

Scientific, technical, and/or other personnel assigned to this task shall have extensive expertise in health physics and radio chemistry in the following areas: 1) design and conduct of radiological surveys in accordance with MARSSIM and NRC guidance, NRC rules, regulations, and inspection procedures; 2) sample preparation, collection methods, analysis techniques, and interpretation of sample data; 3) non-power/power nuclear reactors systems and operations, materials, fuel cycle, uranium recovery, and Site Decommissioning Management Plan sites; and 4) technical knowledge and operational use of survey (i.e., portable instruments, contamination detectors, and in-situ gamma spectroscopy) and laboratory (i.e., gas-proportional counters, liquid scintillation counters, gamma and alpha spectroscopy, and radio chemical separations) instrumentation.

Capability Sought:

As a contingency, the NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in performing sample analysis, document reviews, radiological surveys (i.e., scoping, characterization, remedial action support, in-process, and final status), and special projects related to non-power/power nuclear reactor, fuel facility, uranium recovery, and materials facilities undergoing decommissioning. 

Respondents should provide capabilities which demonstrate their ability to perform the following work requirements: 

Sample Analyses - perform laboratory measurements and radio chemical analysis of samples to include smears, soils, sediments, ground and surface water, vegetation, concrete, and other potentially radiologically contaminated media. The types of analysis will include but are not limited to the following: Gamma Spectroscopy, Alpha Spectroscopy, Gross Alpha/Beta, Liquid Scintillation Counting, Isotopic Radium, Isotopic Strontium, and Technetium-99.  Laboratory work shall be conducted in accordance with a QA program compliant with ASME-NQA-1, Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Facilities.  

Document Reviews - perform technical reviews of a variety of decommissioning documents to include LTPs, DPs, proposed survey and sampling methodologies, technical basis documents, survey reports, sample analysis data, draft NRC regulatory guides, and other assigned special projects.

Radiological Surveys - design and conduct radiological surveys in accordance with agency guidance.  Radiological surveys shall be conducted in accordance with an approved Quality Assurance (QA) program.  

In-Process Evaluations and Confirmatory Survey Inspections - assist with on-site evaluations and in-process inspections conducted at various stages of the licensees/non-licensees decommissioning program in support of its decommissioning survey program or specific request.

Special Projects -  provide technical assistance to NRC staff on special projects related to nuclear facility operations and decommissioning, development of regulatory guidance, and other projects related to radiological health and safety.  These projects may include, but are not limited to, the following: Evaluation of radiological instrumentation and detection sensitivity; and Implementation issues related to the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) and NRC decommissioning guidance

The NRC is seeking commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our technical assistance requirements. Please address the market research questions below and provide capability information on your staffs qualifications and your firms corporate experience and qualifications as demonstrated through similar contracts or efforts. 

1. How long has your business been in operation?

2. What type of business is your company (i.e. small, 8(a), large, etc.)?

3. What is the size of your company in terms of employees and consultants? (Breakdown the mix between the two categories.)

4. Which GSA FSS contracts, if any, do you possess? When do they expire?

6. Has your company effectively established teams in the past such that you could perform scopes of work outside your core competencies? (Describe the types of work and technical disciplines assembled.)

7. List any companies or government agencies your company plans to perform work for related to civilian nuclear reactors, fuel cycle, or uranium mills facilities?

8. Has your company previously faced organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? How were they resolved?

9. Describe any other information your company deems relevant to supporting the inspections of sites to be decommissioned.

10. Describe tasks you have performed in the areas decommissioning of facilities             licensed under 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, and 72.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this "sources sought" is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Baltimore, MD area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs.
<p>Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $59.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $11.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $16.50 ($11.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $59.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $16.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $24.00 ($16.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the Baltimore, MD area, the M&amp;IE rate is $59.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $13.57 ($59.00 X 23%) per person per day.</p>
<p>Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $16.50 per person; lunch, $24.00per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $13.57 per person.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command Joint Munitions and Lethality Life CycleManagement Command, on behalf of The US Army, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of providing a solution to a recurring problem with the operation of the Plasma Ordnance Demilitarization System (PODS).  PODS is an incinerator that will be used for the demilitarization (destruction) of Military ordnance and is located at Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD) in Hawthorne, NV.  The problem being experienced is plugging of off gas piping.  PODS consists of a primary processing chamber followed by a series of interconnected pollution abatement equipment (PAE).  Initial processing of ordnance occurs in the primary processing chamber (PPC), which is an enclosed, oxygen enriched reaction vessel heated by an internally mounted plasma arc torch. The torch, in addition to providing the heat to combust the ordnance, also melts co-fed soil and iron into a slag bath.  Ordnance fed from the top of the PPC drops into the slag bath where it melts and combusts.  Combustion gasses reach temperatures of up to 2,200 F and are continuously drawn off the PPC through the PAE train, which consists of an afterburner, a wet quench, a wet acid gas absorber, a wet high energy scrubber, a dry bag house, and a NOx catalytic reducer.  Plugging occurs in the off gas piping in the hot section of the PAE, between the PPC, the afterburner, and the wet quench units.  Piping in this section is six inch inner diameter and refractory lined (for the purpose of keeping gases at an elevated temperature and high velocity) and features a number of 90 degree elbows.  Plug material typically builds up in the elbows but also settles out on the bottom of some horizontal pipe runs and builds to a point where the process must be stopped and the plug cleared out to allow processing to continue.  Plugging has been experienced when processing pyrotechnic munitions, including a hexachloroethane white smoke, a flare and a simulator.  It is believed these items create a very heavy particulate load, which is evidenced by the fact that the wet portion of the system contains a heavy solids load.  Equipment or process changes that prevent plugging from occurring are being sought and will allow for sustained ordnance processing, which is necessary for cost effective operation.  Interested Offerers shall provide information on their capability of providing a solution to a recurring problem with the operation of the Plasma Ordnance Demilitarization System (PODS). All data should be sent at no cost to the US Government by June 30, 2009 to the US Army Contracting Command. ATTN: Krista M. Ellison, Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07866- 5000, email: krista.ellison@us.army.mil, Tel # (973) 724-6894.  In addition, please provide the firms name and address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, and size of business (small/large). TELEPHONE INQUIRES WILL  NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email.  This is a market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice (Market Survey)
The US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Weapon Systems and Technology Directorate, Indirect Fire Armaments Division, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, is conducting market research for the development of a production manufacturing process for the fabrication and assembly of a high shock and high temperature loaded diode laser igniter for propelling charge initiation in large caliber artillery systems. The laser igniter must be tolerant of high shock and vibration loading (~10,000 Gs axial direction, ~ 5,000 Gs lateral direction) and must operate over a temperature range of  -50C to +150C.  Typical operational constraints for the diode laser igniter are available drive current of 60 - 100 amps (60-70 amps preferred), available drive voltage of 150- 200 Volts,   ~20 - 30 joules nominal output energy, ~15ms pulse width, 0.1Hz duty cycle and an output wavelength range from 750nm to 2 microns.  Life expectancy is typically 10,000-20,000 pulses total over a period of several months to twenty years (i.e.; system could be very active or could be idle for very long periods of time).  The maximum laser beam exit diameter should not exceed 5mm  nor have a beam waist smaller than 5 mm   nor exceed 10mm  at a distance of 1 meter. The physical package size is 22 mm (diameter) X 110 mm long (maximum).  The laser will be in intimate contact with and located within a confined space and must tolerate the overall temperature excursions of the weapon with no active cooling provided to the laser igniter. Low level pulses or low current throttling of the laser is the preferred method for heating the laser when required at the extreme cold temperatures.  Other capabilities to include: the ability to manufacture 15 fully functional laser igniters per day; to be able to deliver initial manufactured production test articles to the Government for Government planned testing and evaluation; to evaluate and analyze the results from the Government planned testing and provide and demonstrate corrective actions/process improvements performed. 
    Firms/companies are invited to indicate their interests and capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, and other technical data. All information is to be submitted via email (10MB limit) at no cost or obligation to the Government; information provided will not be returned. All responsible, interested Offerors are encouraged to submit their capabilities / qualification data No LATER THAN June 24th, 2009.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email. When responding please include your socioeconomic standard as listed in FAR 19.202-5(a). 
The Technical Point of Contact for this action is Tom DeVoe, Electrical Engineer RDAR-WSW-I,  thomas.devoe@us.army.mil 
This is a Sources Sought / Market Survey Announcement only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers is performing market research to identify firms capable of maintaining the Army Facilities Components Systems (AFCS) database. AFCS is a database of structural designs, bills of materials (BOM), logistics data, and related information that describes installations, facilities, buildings, and other structures and works commonly required by military forces for base development, lines of communication activities, and tactical operations.  AFCS is primarily used by units in contingency operations, but can also be used to support construction for disaster relief and peacetime temporary construction. Military planners use AFCS to select the appropriate temporary facilities and to extract necessary information for construction planning. The AFCS database enables users to adapt required building materials to local climates.  The AFCS design library contains simple and standard temporary facility designs that require minimum engineer support to be assembled. These designs allow non-engineer troops or indigenous labor to perform the majority of the work which enables the engineer to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.  The unique and highly specialized services provided by AFCS support ongoing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, disaster relief, and other contingency operations.<BR><BR>The basic requirement is to perform studies and develop austere contingency designs and support data.  AFCS designs are reviewed and updated to use unique state-of-the-art technology in construction designs, materials, and techniques to conserve resources. The AFCS database enables users to adapt required building materials to local customs.  The AFCS design library contains simple and standard temporary facility designs that require minimum engineer support to be assembled. These designs allow non-engineer troops or indigenous labor to perform the majority of the work which enables the engineer to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.  Services to be provided include, but are not limited to: (1) The development, conversion, and revision of drawings, bill of materials (BOM), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE) and construction process management estimates for a variety of facilities and installations in Army contingency operations; (2) Input of drawings, bill of materials (BOM), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE) and construction process management estimates into the AFCS32 database; (3) Revision and maintenance of Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) standards technical manual (TM); (4)  Analysis of Theater of Operations (TO) Army Construction and facility requirements and preparation of criteria and plans for updating AFCS, AFCS32 designs and TOGS to satisfy those requirements and (5) Preparation of AFCS and AFCS32 drawings using Computer-Aided Design techniques and provision of digitized drawing in AFCS and AFCS32 input format.  Customers access AFCS data through the Theater Construction Management System (TCMS). TCMS is a PC based automated construction planning, design, management, and reporting system that is used by military engineers for contingency construction activities. TCMS combines state-of-the-art computer hardware and software with the Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) design information to support engineering missions . Consequently, it is critical that the AFCS designs and data be in the proper data formats to interface with TCMS. <BR><BR>The Government intends to procure the services through the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with one base year ordering period and four one-year options.  The total amount of the contract over the five year ordering period is not expected to exceed $25,000,000.  Historically, this work has resulted in task orders ranging from $25,000 to $2,700,000.  The selected firm must be able to execute at least twenty simultaneous task orders ranging in value from $100,000 to $5,000,000. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  The initial contract is anticipated to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2009.<BR><BR>Potential HUBZone Small Business Contractors are invited it review the attached performance work statement and to submit a response to the Sources Sought Questionnaire.

<DESC>Work requirements for Hydrodynamic Modeling:<BR><BR>The New Orleans District intends to award the University of New Orleans a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed Price purchase order for representative salinity time series for the region from Lake Maurepas to Mississippi Sound and GIS spatial representations of these time series using the UNO mass balance model [Roblin 2008; McCorquodale et al 2009]. GIS spatial representations of the MRGO salinity targets for the study area would be developed based on the mean optimal salinity at the Ford Line and the standard errors for each month. Target salinity ranges will be represented spatially and temporally. Data analysis will be performed to determine the temporal and spatial variation of study area salinity and water quality, as well as validate/calibrate model performance. Representative salinity time series for the pre-2009, baseline, future without project, and future with project condition would be developed. The representation records will include average monthly salinity for dry, wet and near normal years and will be based on the available hydrologic inputs. The model will be calibrated/validated with data provided by USACE SAM. Consistency among the various data sources will be examined. A GIS spatial representation of the analyzed data will be produced.  The representative time series will be compared to the salinity targets to determine if the targets have been met historically, and if not, under which conditions and how often the targets have not been met. Inputs, such as bathymetry, would be updated if available and determined to be necessary. The baseline condition period would include the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (IHNC) storm surge barrier and the full closure structure on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) just south of Bayou La Loutre. The future without project condition would include the baseline condition projects and other projects determined to be part of future without project condition. To present these simulated data for the selected locations on a monthly basis consistent with the salinity targets for the project; mean and upper and lower deciles will be reported.  Output will be recorded for wet, dry, and normal year scenarios.  This is a notice of intent AND a source for sought. Data should be post-processed for input as needed into water quality and ecological models.  Model outputs and methodology should be documented in a modeling report. Interested parties shall notify Christopher Nuccio at (504) 862-2704 by COB on 6/17/09.  It is the Government's intent not to compete this procurement due to its proprietary nature.  THIS IS A SYNOPSIS AND SOURCE FOR SOUGHT COMBINED.  THERE WILL BE NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING.<BR>

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issues this request for information and planning purposes only. This notice is not a Request for Proposal/Quote or Bid. This request for information is a market research tool to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources which will be used for planning purposes and to determine if potential sources exist to support the requirement. This information is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government.</p>
<p>Background: USSOCOM requires managerial, technical, and engineering support to research and develop technology solutions to satisfy the USSOCOM capability roadmap for data storage requirements in the Special Operations Forces Information Environment (SIE). The contractor shall aid in requirements definition, engineering design, testing and evaluation, product integration, and product integration culminating with a demonstration during Coalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstrations or other Government selected venue.</p>
<p>Objectives: USSOCOM requires a secure, scalable storage approach for inclusion into the SIE Classless Stateless Trusted Environment (CSTE) - a concept to provide an SIE-wide data storage capability serving the largest CONUS based locations out to the most forward-deployed tactical user. CSTE storage flattens the information space and supports information continuity from commander to individual SOF warrior. The CSTE storage component will enable Continuity of Operations (COOP) enterprise-wide without regard to where the data is stored. End-users shall have access to data regardless of where on the SIE they access it.</p>
<p>&bull; Improve transportability of the TACLAN system by eliminating redundant data hardware, converging networks, and running virtualized COI's on a single infrastructure, thereby reducing the equipment footprint and decreasing set-up time in a tactical environment.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will monitor and assess USSOCOM programs and projects that have (or may have) an important bearing on SIE-storage technology, especially the integration of information systems and services (Enterprise Collaboration Discovery, Security and Delivery) consistent with implementation of DoD's Net-Centric Data Strategy and Information Sharing Strategy.</p>
<p><br />Task 1 - Requirements Analysis<br />The contractor shall conduct a requirements analysis of the SIE data storage environment and deliver an engineering design that meets the CSTE objectives. The contractor will provide any needed data collection tools, conduct surveys, hold meetings with customers, analyze current SIE WAN links and bandwidth utilization amongst multiple locations, consolidate and refine user requirements, and provide technical assistance to fully define requirements for data storage in support of the CSTE concept for the SIE. The design will provide for a prototype solution to be tested and evaluated on TACLAN in preparation for demonstration. Solution must support NAS and SAN implementations. In addition, contractor will support collapsing multiple networks (Secret and below only) into a single infrastructure. The proposed objectives of this task are: <br />&bull; The SIE storage component will consist of three tiers: local, organizational, and enterprise - designed to enable informational continuity at all times, thus eliminating the need for conventional data recovery and COOP methods.</p>
<p>&bull; Storage will be provided via federated, synchronized, and staged net-centric operations where capabilities and data are vigilantly protected while ensuring the right people can access the right data at the right time.</p>
<p>&bull; The SIE storage component requires a federated control capability to manage all storage tiers, but must also allow for local monitoring and control.</p>
<p>&bull; Directly protect data objects, and be consistent with implementation of DoD's Net-Centric Data Strategy and Information Sharing Strategy.</p>
<p>&bull; All data must be able to be randomly bit-split and encrypted using unique session-based keys protected by workgroup keys.</p>
<p>&bull; Data must be able to be stored at any number of user specified locations and provide M of N fault tolerance (N being the number of shares the data is divided into and M being the minimum number of shares required to recover the data) to aid in data recovery.</p>
<p>&bull; Improve transportability of the TACLAN system by eliminating redundant data hardware, converging networks, and running virtualized COI's on a single infrastructure, thereby reducing the equipment footprint and decreasing set-up time in a tactical environment.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will monitor and assess USSOCOM programs and projects that have (or may have) an important bearing on SIE-storage technology, especially the integration of information systems and services (Enterprise Collaboration Discovery, Security and Delivery) consistent with implementation of DoD's Net-Centric Data Strategy and Information Sharing Strategy.</p>
<p><br />Task 2 - Test and Evaluation<br />The contractor shall support the testing and evaluation of the CSTE prototype data storage solution on TACLAN during demonstrations. The hardware and software for testing shall be determined through the requirements analysis process (Task 1). The prototype storage solution shall be a phased or spiral development, incorporating new phases or spirals as approved by the Government. The contractor will support a prototype demonstration of the storage prototype at a maximum of four geographically dispersed locations or other events identified by the Government such as Future Expeditionary Special Operations Forces Demonstrations. The proposed objectives of this task are:</p>
<p>&bull; The prototype solution will support SIE-wide network-centric storage for both in-garrison and tactical environments, and will be specifically demonstrated on the USSOCOM Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) environment.</p>
<p>&bull; Separate shares must be storable on separate storage media in dispersed locations-both local and geographically remote. A complete copy of the data cannot exist on any storage media volume, and must be provably secure.</p>
<p>&bull; All stored data will be assignable to government-defined Communities of Interest (CoIs) using unique work-group keys. CoIs may be based on classification of the information or end-user grouping, but all data must be bit-split and encrypted to remain classless.</p>
<p>&bull; SIE storage must support disk virtualization where an administrator can create a virtual disk, allocate storage to it, and assign the virtual disk to a specific CoI. Multiple virtual disks using different CoIs can share the same storage areas.</p>
<p>&bull; Administrators must be able to call a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to monitor status, check for events and perform security functions from a single console, be able to create, modify and destroy virtual disks, be able to make the disks visible or invisible to any CoI without requiring the re-zoning of the individual switches in the storage network.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Task 1:<br />6.1.1 Solution Requirements Document<br />Task 2: <br />6.2.1 Prototype definition, Test, Implementation and Evaluation Report<br />6.2.2 Required Documentation</p>
<p><br />This request for information will be used for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. No contract will be awarded as a result of this request. All information received in response to this request that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses&nbsp;will not be returned.

<DESC><p>This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to modify the existing sole source contract FA2550-08-C-8012, Obscura, Mission Integration, &amp; Network Support (OMINS) with the contractor currently performing the effort (Lockheed Martin Integration Systems &amp; Solutions) to extend the period of performance. The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). The extended period of performance is 01 July 2009 through 31 December 2009 to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.
<p>The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.<br />Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</p>
<p>Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</p>
<p>Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement by 12:00 pm MDST, June 17, 2009, via email to the attention of: kathryn.dillon@schriever.af.mil. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing capability information will be provided. Information received will be solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The North American Industrial Classification System Number (NAICS) is 541330, Engineering Services and the size standard is $4.5M.</p>

This project provides for the replacement of leaking sections in both the open and closed geothermal and hot water loops.  The government estimates $400,000.00 to complete this project.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is Public Law (P.L.) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, currently implemented by Office of Acquisition and Logistics' Information Letter (IL) 049-07-8, the Veterans First Contracting Program.5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.     The contractor, Q Services and Technologies, has performed similar work at the Boise VA Medical Center. The geothermal water system offers unique challenges which the contractor has successfully met in performance of the previous contract.  Additionally, the contractor has demonstrated reputable past performance. As a result, it was decided to be in the best interest of the government to acquire this service from this contractor.  6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

<p>CONTACT POINTS: Mary Alice Powe, Contracting Officer, (301) 975-8567</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order on a Sole Source basis under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106(b); with PTW New York, Hicksville, New York for the purchase of Part Number: TN34013, Soft X-ray chamber 0.005 cm 3, Fully guarded, parallel plate, poly-ethylene therapy chamber with 0.03 mm entrance window. Distance entrance window-chamber body 0.3 mm; Open chamber volume; Cable length 1.5 m, connecting system BNT.</p>
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the following: The equipment is necessary to develop the NIST electronic brachytherapy facility. The PTW TN34013 is the only chamber that fits the geometric conditions of the setup. The required chamber, with all its features, is only manufactured by PTW. Extensive research has been conducted to identify the appropriateness of this chamber for this application. This research includes previous use at NIST, independent users, the manufacturer and the developer of the skin dose applicators who use this as part of their proprietary system. The requested model PTW chamber is part of a proprietary measurement system, which will be used to support the development of the NIST facility. The proprietary skin dose applicators require this type chamber for traceability. The chamber needs to be available for purchase. A new design is unacceptable. The performance history of this model chamber is well defined and the cost and time of repeating the research is impossible and unnecessary for the time frame of the project.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this product shall be SEVEN (7) days after receipt of the purchase order.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423450.</p>

The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond ot his requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 11:00 AM (EST) on June 5, 2009. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to maryalice.powe@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) plans to issue a SOLE-SOURCE Purchase Order to the University of  California  Davis (UCD), for UCD to plan, organize and host the Twelfth (2009) Biennial Conference on Transportation Energy and Environmental Policy.  It is anticipated that the conference will be held at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California, from July 28th through July 31st, 2009.  The conference is sponsored by DOTs Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting, by the California Environmental Protection Agency, by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by the U. S. Department of Energy, among others.  The conference is organized under the auspices of the Energy, Alternative Fuel, and Sustainable Transportation Committees of the U. S. Transportation Research Board.  The conference will examine expanding public and private climate change, hydrogen and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases from transportation.  The focus of the conference will be on sub-national, national, and private activities to reduce government greenhouse gas emissions and how they relate to international climate policy.  Because of the vast network of professional contacts that UCD has developed as a result of its having hosted the previous Biennial Conferences since the late 1980s, UCD is believed to be the only organization that is capable of planning, organizing and hosting the 2009 Biennial Conference at the high level of quality and efficiency that is indispensable to DOT.  Notwithstanding the overwhelming SOLE-SOURCE qualifications thought to be possessed by UCD, any organization OTHER THAN UCD that believes it is capable of planning, organizing and hosting the 2009 Biennial Conference may e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to Mr. James Mowery, at james.mowery@dot.gov, not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time June 19, 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-02-C-0006, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Lake Lanier Project, Buford Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  The modification will be funded by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds. The modification will increase the level of effort required under the current contract as follows: 1) Upgrade 185 campsites at two campgrounds to 50 amp electrical service.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each campsite.  2)  The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 36 recreation areas, five operations areas, and the Project Management Office.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY- THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue an 8 (a) Sole Source, Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Spectra Tech, Inc., 132 Jefferson Ct, Oak Ridge, TN  37830.  Solicitation W91278-09-R-0063 is being issued to them for Professional Services for the US Army Corps of Engineers, South Atlantic Division.  The services provided will be technical support, quality assurance and project management.  The primary tasking will involve providing overall technical support to various hydropower and related facilities throughout the South Atlantic Division.  Technical support can include Bidability, Constructability, operability, and Environmental (BCOE) and design reviews, technical and environmental plan reviews, value engineering reviews, and CADD support.  Other tasks may include performing quality assurance duties, program support, such as data gathering or data entry.<BR><BR>Small business set-asides allow for agencies to use competitive procedures to identify and select small businesses from the commercial marketplace to provide products and services to government agencies.  See FAR Subpart 19.5. A number of additional small business authorities provide for agencies to make awards both competitively and noncompetitively to various types of small businesses to further the governments enacted socioeconomic policy goals. By doing so, these programs help agencies maximize small business participation in federal contracting which, in turn, helps small businesses maximize the economic benefits they provide to their communities.<BR><BR>Accordingly, to further the aims of the Recovery Act, agencies are strongly encouraged to take advantage of authorized small business contracting programs, which may include use of noncompetitive authorities, to create opportunities for small businesses. Specifically, agency program, acquisition, and small business offices should work together in planning acquisitions to identify: (1) requirements that can be met effectively with the help of small businesses and (2) the small business contracting authority that is best suited for a given requirement.<BR><BR>Some Task Orders under this IDIQ may be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Such Task Orders will be separately posted and identified as being Recovery Act funded, and detail any special requirements of the contractor related to the execution of such funds.  <BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The Solicitation number is: OPM049-09-Q-0044 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32 dated May 14, 2009.

This procurement is a total set-aside for Small Business with the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541870.  The small business size standard is $7.0 million. 

The Human Resources Products and Services Group (HRPS) provides high quality, cost-effective services and products that help their customers recruit and retain the best talent; develop and maintain a results-oriented federal leadership team; and support Federal employees, annuitants and their families with a variety of quality benefits options. HRPS is comprised of three centers: the Center for Talent Services, Center for Retirement and Insurance Services, and Center for Leadership Capacity Services. 

The Center for Retirement and Insurance Services (CRIS) is responsible for developing and providing Federal employees, retirees and their families with benefits programs and services that offer choice, value and quality to help maintain the government's position as a competitive employer.  In support of this mission, CRIS is responsible for the design, page layout, typesetting, and publishing of the Federal Benefits Guides.  These guides provide Federal employees, retirees and survivor annuitants with the capabilities of enrolling in a health plan and/or changing from one plan or option to another, from self only to self and family, or make a combination of these changes.

In support of this initiative, CRIS has a need for a contractor to produce six (6) Guides to Federal Benefits and 54 Specific Charts for various States and selected US Territories to be designed on an annual basis for our Federal Employees Health Benefits Open Season which occurs each fall.

SCOPE OF SERVICES
The wellness services to be provided under this subcontract shall conform, at a minimum to health and weUness services specified in the Job Corps Federal Regulations (Title 20 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 638.510), in the Job Corps Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), Chapter 5 and applicable Technical Assistance Guides (TAGs). To accomplish these ends, the Center Physician shall:
A. Provide wellness services for a maximum of twelve (12) hours per week. Any additional hours must be approved in advance by the Center Director. The services will be provided at the facilities located at the Center Wellness Services Clinic. Center staff will provide clinical services in emergency situations only, except as provided in written health care guidelines. The Wellness Center is not authorized to provide routine treatment to staff
The maximum weeks of service will not exceed 48 weeks per year. Services are not required during DOL-mandated Center shutdowns that occur during the summer (2 weeks in July) and winter (2 weeks in December). The Subcontractor will not be paid during this period, unless the Physician is required by the Center to provide services, including call, or attend Center-mandated training during this shutdown.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 375 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only.

Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to reserve their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The resultant contract is not intended to cover the price of hotel rooms occupied for the conference attendees, each attendee will be billed by the hotel for his or her room.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The "Conference Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which each conference will be held - The quote total will include the total number of room charges, the audio/visual, the conference space rental, and any other quoted charges or discounts granted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms shall be structured in a format that indicates if the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order.

Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per-night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms and conference spaces to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the night periods separately, and a Conference Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be technically acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The evaluation factors for this procurement are Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).

<p>Name Brand Justification for RM Young Wind Monitors Replacement Parts</p>
<p>&bull; The RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are the standard wind monitoring sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast below the Mason-Dixon Line, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment. <br />&bull; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct. <br />&bull; These RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.<br />&bull; CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor. <br />&bull; CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.<br />&bull; The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required. <br />&bull; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor. <br />&bull; Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.<br />&bull; CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty.</p>
<p>Name Brand Justification for RM Young<br />Multi-Plate Solar Radiation and Precipitation Shields</p>
<p><br />The RM Young Multi-Plate Solar Radiation and Precipitation Shield Model 41003 is the standard shield used for air temperature and relative humidity sensors at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico, throughout the Pacific, the Great Lakes, the Caribbean, and in Alaska. Implementing a different shield in place of the current one will result in the need for additional costs and resources.</p>
<p>&bull; CO-OPS stations are designed for the use of the RM Young Model 41003 shield. A change of shield type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new shield for optimal performance of the sensor it houses. <br />&bull; New mounting hardware will need to be developed and purchased to mount a new type of shield.<br />&bull; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Model 41003 shield. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new shield. <br />&bull; Using another type of shield will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple types of shields in a given region.</p>

<DESC>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT
STATEMENT OF WORK
AVIATION SUPPORT SERVICES


Overview

The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Government wide Policy, Office of Travel, Transportation, and Asset Management requires support services for various aviation studies, training, and plans for Federal government agencies.  This Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is a small business set-aside, and award will be made to only one company.  The period of performance will be one year, with four, one-year options.

GSA Mission

The Office of Travel, Transportation and Asset Management (MT) within the Office of Government wide Policy (OGP) of the GSA develops Federal aviation policy for the entire Federal Government fleet of over 1500 aircraft.  MT was established, in part, to provide GSA with a mechanism to be more active in the government-wide policy setting arena, and to be separate from the operational functions performed by GSA.  The office is an advocate for both excellence and innovation to improve the management and operation of the Governments aviation programs that foster safe, effective and efficient Federal aviation operations.  

Background

The Interagency Committee for Aircraft Policy (ICAP) was established at the direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and is managed by MT.  Eighteen Federal agencies are members of the ICAP and manage/use aircraft for various missions including firefighting, law enforcement, weather prediction, natural resource support, homeland security, and space research.  The ICAP assists GSA in writing government-wide policies for Federal aviation management.  

OMB Circular A-126, Improving the Management and Use of Government Aircraft, tasks the Administrator of the GSA with essential policy and oversight responsibilities for Federal aviation management.  GSAs Aircraft Management Policy staff is responsible for developing Federal aircraft policy on behalf of the Administrator.  

OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget addresses the budget process as well as planning, budgeting and acquisition of capital assets.  Part 7, Exhibit-300 provides direction on preparing and submitting information on new and past acquisitions.

Because management of aviation services is very complex and time consuming, many agencies use contract mechanisms to accommodate various requirements originating from Federal Aviation Regulations and OMB Circulars A-126 and A-11. 

There will be no performance standards required under the BPA itself.  Performance standards will be embedded in the Task Orders issued by federal agencies requesting use of the GSA generated BPA.


1.0	Technical Requirements/Task Description

1.1	Aviation Studies, Training, and Plans.

  The objective of this BPA is to support various aviation studies, workshops, conferences, training and plans performed at the request of individual federal agencies.  The Contractor will conduct all studies, training and plans in accordance with the Task Order issued by an executive agency using the BPA.  These studies include, but are not limited to:

1.1.2	Aircraft Acquisition and Lifecycle Planning: These studies involve acquisition planning, alternative analysis, annual budget performance, and replacement studies (damaged, obsolete, or worn out aircraft).  These are complex assessments that compare and contrast the costs associated with government owned, government flown, and government maintained aircraft against various operational models for operating, renting, or contracting aircraft support.



1.1.3	Federal Aircraft Fleet Cost Accounting Studies performed in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11.

1.1.4	Aircraft training performed in support of various GSA and Federal agency conferences, workshops, and training sessions.  Support may include workshop planning, specific aircraft management training sessions, and project management training.

2.1.1	The Contractor is responsible for providing personnel that have appropriate levels of expertise and skill to accomplish requirements identified in the requesting agency Task Order.

2.1.2	The Contractor will perform work at sites specified in the requesting agency Task Order, and at the Contractors place of business.

2.1.3	The Contractor may be required to travel to complete the requirements of the requesting agency.  All travel requirements will be documented in the Task Order and directed by the requesting agency. 

2.1.4	Unless otherwise directed in the Task Order, all materials will be provided by the Contractor to perform the work required by the Task Order.  All material purchased by the Contractor for the use or ownership of the Federal Government will become the property of the Federal Government.  The Contract must document the transfer of materials in the monthly status reports.

2.1.5	All deliverables required by the Task Order must meet or exceed industry professional standards, and the requirements set forth in Task Order and this BPA.

             in each individual task order.

4.0	Duration of BPA

4.1	The period of performance for this BPA shall be one (1) base year and four (4) one year options.

5.0	       Personal Services

5.1	GSA will assure that any contractor work is in the best interest of the government; that economic and other factors are considered; and that this SOW will not be used to procure personal services prohibited by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 37.104 titled Personal Services Contract.





6.0	Requirement Estimate and Authority to Use BPA	

6.1	GSA anticipates the total cost of task orders awarded under this BPA shall not exceed $200,000.00.  In addition to Government agencies that own /operate aircraft, any Government agency will be able to use the BPA to accomplish aviation studies (including GSA).

7.0	Proposal Submission

7.1	After reviewing this SOW, the contractor shall submit a technical and cost proposal to the GSA Central Office Contracting Division.  Proposals shall summarize major categories at a level of detail to adequately address all requirements in the SOW.

Provide resumes for proposed staff.  

7.1.5	Price

Any resultant agreement from this solicitation will be for the BPA award.  There will be no funds placed on the BPA itself, but the individual Task Orders issued by each agency will be funded.  So it is to each agency that the BPA holder will submit specific cost information for each Task Order.  However the importance of price in the award of the BPA cannot be overlooked.  Offerors must submit general price information including direct labor rates, indirect rates, other overhead rates, etc., so GSA can achieve some sense of the pricing that would be charged on the agency specific Task Orders.

8.0	Technical Evaluation Factors

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION #: F3G2AE9093A001<br />This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request For Quotes</p>
<p>NAICS: 423210 - Furniture Merchant Wholesalers<br />This combined synopsis/solicitation is being issued as 100% Small Business Set-Aside.<br />SBA Size Standard: 100 Employees</p>
<p>Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, NV requires a contract for: Purchase, design/layout, and installation of office furniture for the new AMXS Aggressor F16 hanger. See attached product list for description of items to be purchased.</p>
<p>Amendment 6: Clarification has been posted regarding the under-desk cabinets.&nbsp; See attached parts list "Furniture List Edited 02 June 2009"; clarification is posted in red on the fron page.</p>
<p>Amendment 5: Question and Answer List</p>
<p>Will any furniture be placed in the vault or the COSO cage? If so, please specify what furniture will be placed in those areas?</p>
<p>- Yes, the COSO Cage will contain two rectangular desks, two hutches, two chairs, and one bookcase<br />---------<br />I am working on your quote for the Stanley-Vidmar workstation qty of 3 but the model number A-8 is not a model, it is a line of cabinets. I need full specs with measurements for the top and the cabinets. This is a made to order custom line of workstations and I can not quote it without full measurements.</p>
<p>- The left pedestal should be 30" wide x 27-3/4" Deep x 33" high with 5 drawers. Drawer 1 useable depth 2-1/4", drawer 2 3", drawer 3 3-7/8", drawer 4 5-3/8", drawer 5 8-1/2". The right pedestal should have the same dimensions with 4 drawers. Drawer 1 useable depth 3-7/8", drawer 2 6-1/4", drawers 3 and 4 7". The top must be 1-3/4" thick solid hardwood and be 84" long x 28 1/2" deep. The riser shelf should be 15" high x 12" deep x 84" long with a full back panel, 7 electrical outlets spread evenly under the shelf against the back panel and end stops along the back and both sides of the shelf.<br />-------------<br />Will you accept an open door, non-locking TV cabinet for the Conference area?</p>
<p>- No. We must have a lockable TV cabinet to deter theft of electronics.<br />--------------<br />Was it determined if the pedestals need to be keyed to have the same key number per each person's station or is random keying okay meaning others may have the same key number in the pedestals?</p>
<p>- Each desk/workstation must be keyed to have the same key number per person's station/desk.<br />--------------<br />There is a discrepancy in the furniture list. The APG room has listed 5 desks, but only 4 high back chairs, is this done intentionally? If not, please specify the correct number of chairs and desks.</p>
<p>- The APG office should have 5 desks and 5 high back chairs.</p>
<p>*** The attached furniture list has been edited to reflect this change.<br />-------------<br />Also Note: There was some confusion regarding the "U-Shaped" Conference Table. At the site visit, the customer specified that he wanted a "U-Shaped" table with either a rounded or an angled edge. The customer did not want three rectangular tables put together to resemble a "U-Shape."</p>
<p>For clarification purposes I've attached a sketch of the type of "U-shaped" table that the customer had in mind. Please note that the sketch is not drawn to scale and is meant only as an approximation.</p>
<p>Amendment 4: The response deadline for this solicitation has been extended to Monday 08 June 2009 at 12:00 pm PDT, in order to allow for enough time to answer all the questions that were asked.</p>
<p>Amendment 3: The response deadline has been extended to Tuesday 26 May 2009&nbsp;at 12:00 pm PDT.&nbsp; The following changes were also made to the attached furniture list: The microwave hutches are no longer needed and were thus removed from the list.</p>
<p>Amendment 2: Changes have been made to the attached furniture list.&nbsp; All previous copies of the furniture list are now obsolete.&nbsp; For the most current furniture list, view the attachment titled "Furniture List Edited 7 May 2009."&nbsp; The requested changes to the furniture list are marked in red.</p>
<p>Amendment 1: Questions and Answers<br />1. Is there an onsite dumpster for trash? No<br />2. Does Nellis AFB have cardboard recycling and will they stage a dumpster for the install? No<br />Note: The contractor is responsible for disposing of any cardboard/trash as a result of the furniture installation.<br />3. How many floors are in the building? 2 floors<br />4. Is there an elevator? Yes, there is a passenger elevator.<br />5. Are working hours standard 8-5 (for installation)? Yes, installation shall be done within standard working hours (between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm).<br />6. Is there existing furniture to work around, or that has to be moved? No<br />7. Will added features or benefits be looked at as favorable? Award will be made based on Lowest Price and Delivery Schedule (I cannot award to a contractor that offers added features for a higher price, if there is a lower bidder that meets all the requirements within the solicitation).<br />8. Will desks with wood laminate tops and metal chassis/underneath storage be considered? No, wood laminate/metal combinations are not desired.

4.7.1 Personnel Security

4.7.1.1 The USAO will process background security investigations for grand jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract. Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to grand jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval. If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to grand jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2 Required Security Investigation

4.7.2.1 The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder. The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:


 Policy development or implementation

 Higher-level management assignment

 Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

 Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

 IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

 Assistance to policy development and implementation,

 Mid-level management assignments,

 Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

 Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

 IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3 Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2. As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category. In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.

The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order. However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver. The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position. A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor. When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract. Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Low Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of Investigation Name and Fingerprint check. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check.

4.7.2.5 The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below. The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.

Title and Number of Form No. of Copies

FD-258 Fingerprint Card 2
SF 85P - Questionnaire For 2
Public Trust Positions

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on: 1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities. If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA. In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness. Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees. If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required. The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures. If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations. The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees. This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract. Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
changes.

(g) The motivation for the conduct.

(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract. However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel. In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA. In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants. If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15 Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. 

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause. The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3 Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

(End of Clause)
SECTION D. ATTACHMENTS

D.1 Contractor Residency Requirement Information

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 2 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency 

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

 Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

 Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

 Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

 Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

 Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

 Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

 With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

 Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

 Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.

 Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

 Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractors responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance Emergency Acquisitions, May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

E.1	52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items.

As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:

(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show 
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;

(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
I Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the senders request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
I If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

6-1-2009 - The following are answers to questions received:

Q.  Is there any possible way you would consider amending this quotation to a Service Disabled Veteran SB set aside in accordance with PL 108.183?
A.  The procurement has been designated by the Contracting Officer as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 19, Small Business Programs.  This does not restrict Service Disabled Veteran Small Businesses from submitting quotes.

Q.  Should the NAICS Code assigned to this procurement be 492110?
A.  We believe the NAICS code 511110, Newpaper Publishers, describes the requirement better than 492110, Courier Services, as the awarded vendor is responsible for obtaining the newspapers and magazines from their own source and delivering them to the SEC.

Q.  Is the deadline to reply with a quote June 17th at 2:30pm?
A.  Yes, the deadline for providing quotes is Wednesday, June 17, 2009 at 2:30pm Eastern.


5-26-2009 - The following are answers to questions received:


Q.  Since this solicitation is for delivery and bundling only, who is responsible for paying for the subscriptions?

A. The vendor shall obtain the newspapers and magazines from its source and quote a fixed price for each line item listed in the RFQ, Part 1 - The Schedule. 

Q. If the quantities of subscriptions change, who will make the change in the number of subscriptions and who pays for the additional copies?

A. If the quantities change during the period of performance, the additional quantities will be ordered and paid for by the SEC with a credit card. 

Q. What is the exact pick-up location of the subscriptions?

A. The vendor shall be responsible for obtaining the newspapers and magazines from its source and delivering them to the SEC. The vendor shall label, bundle and deliver the newspapers and magazines to the SEC in accordance with the terms and conditions of the RFQ.



5/21/2009 - The following is a question and answer:

Q:  What or where is the pick up point for the newspapers and magazines?
A:  The vendor is responsible for obtaining the newspapers and magazines from their own source and delivering them to the SEC in accordance with the terms and conditions of the RFQ.

5/19/2009 - The following are questions received and answers:

Q:  Is the contractor required to pack and deliver the publications?
A:  Yes.  Our requirement is for a bundling and delivery service, not for a subscription service.

Q:  Can the credit card be charged at the time of invoice creation or must the SEC approve invoices prior to payment?
A:  The initial purchase order will be paid when an invoice is received, approved and processed for payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.  Credit card orders may be placed for additional items throughout the duration of the period of performance.  These charges would be paid by credit card as the new orders are placed.

Q: Does my firm need to have a GSA Schedule in order to submit a quote?
A: No, you do not need to have a GSA Schedule to respond to the request for quote.  All Small Business vendors are encouraged to submit a response.

Q:  Are electronic submissions acceptable?
A.  Yes, electronic submissions are acceptable.  If the quotes are delivered by email, they must be followed by one (1) signed hardcopy original of each quote within four (4) business days of the closing date (see RFQ Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Quoters).

Q:  We have been working to establish our CCR through the CCR.gov web site.  There have been some technical delays associated with the registration.  Is it possible for us to submit our quote without the CCR?
A:  Quoters must be able to show that they have made an attempt to register at CCR. You can submit an email, a copy/screenshot of the CCR page, etc. to show your attempt to comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS 

TO PROVIDE GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONCRETE PAD FOR THE INSTALLATION OF AN EXPLOSIVE STORAGE MAGAZINE AT SEATTLE-TACOMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - (SEA) 

 
1.0	Purpose

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) National Explosive Detection Canine Team Program (NEDCTP) is committed to establishing safe, secure repositories for training equipment related to the Proprietary Canine Program. To this end, NEDCTP desires to install and maintain an explosives magazine at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.  To achieve this goal, NEDCTP requires this site be prepared for receipt and installation of this magazine.

1.1 Background

TSA is contracting with airports to install explosives storage magazine facilities to be located on or near airport grounds. Each facility will house explosive storage magazine(s) that will safely and securely hold the TSA-approved explosive training aids which are required to train and maintain the proficiency of the TSA explosives detector canines.

1.2 Technical Requirements/Task 

The Contractor shall be responsible for investigating the site for utilities, preparing design drawings for approval, constructing a concrete pad, installing a grounding rod, an encompassing barricade, roof, erecting enclosure fencing, access gate, and associated lighting if necessary.  The construction deliverables are to meet requirements set forth in ATF 5400.7, as well as the following Tasks:

A.  Pre-Construction:

The Contractor will investigate the proposed construction site to locate any utilities, and to ensure that the location will not hinder existing utilities.  

The Contractor will produce engineering drawings based on the construction details in Section B, below. Drawings will need to be submitted to the Port of Seattle for approval prior to the commencement of construction. 

Drawings will need to address:
	All materials to be utilized
	Any water valves and sewer clean outs at the site

B. Construction

Task 1: The contractor shall construct, at minimum, a gravel, crushed stone or DGA base (free draining material) twenty-eight (28) feet wide by forty (40) feet long by four (4) inches deep. The sub-grade must be compacted to meet the ASTM standard of 95%.

Task 2: The contractor shall construct, at a minimum, a smooth/brushed finished concrete pad twenty-eight (28) feet wide by forty (40) feet long by six (6) inches thick at 3,500 pounds per square inch (PSI).  This pad is to be reinforced with 6 X 6 10/10 welded wire fabric or fiberglass reinforced.  It is to conform to (ACI) recommendations and local building codes.  

Task 3:  The contractor shall install two (2) .75 inch by ten (10) foot copper clad grounding rods at opposing ends of pad. Exact location will be determined before start of project.  These grounding rods will be provided by customer. 

Task 4:  The contractor shall construct, at a minimum, an encompassing barricade, either natural or man-made, in accordance with ATF 5400.7, Subpart B, Definitions (see Artificial Barricade and Barricaded). This barricade must meet the standard to conform to ATF 5400.7, Section 55.218 - Table of Distances for Storage of Explosive Materials.  The outer edge of the barrier must be two feet from the concrete pad edge on all sides. This barrier serves to contain or deflect a blast in the event of an unexpected detonation of the explosives storage magazine.  The contractor shall build one roof with a minimum of six (6) inch overhang on all sides.  The roof shall contain a sloping angle and proper drainage material.

Task 5:  The contractor shall erect enclosure fencing and access gate.  This fencing and access gate defines the outermost perimeter of the explosives magazine compound, and serves to restrict access solely to authorized personnel.  Specifications will be finalized during contract negotiations. The fencing must be a minimum of seven (7) feet in height with at least three (3) rows of barbed or razor wire held in place and set at six (6) inches apart across the top of the fencing. The gate locking mechanism must have a lockable drop rod assembly with inset. 

Tasks 4 and Task 5 shall be completed after delivery of the explosive magazine(s).

(a) Definition.Site of the work 

(1) Means-- 

(i) The primary site of the work. The physical place or places where the construction called for in the contract will remain when work on it is completed; and 

(ii) The secondary site of the work, if any. Any other site where a significant portion of the building or work is constructed, provided that such site is 

(A) Located in the United States; and 

(B) Established specifically for the performance of the contract or project; 

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this definition, includes any fabrication plants, mobile factories, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., provided 

(i) They are dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to performance of the contract or project; and 

(ii) They are adjacent or virtually adjacent to the primary site of the work as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i), or the secondary site of the work as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this definition; 

(3) Does not include permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, or tool yards of a Contractor or subcontractor whose locations and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular Federal contract or project. In addition, fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, yards, etc., of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the Project site, are not included in the site of the work. Such permanent, previously established facilities are not a part of the site of the work even if the operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively or nearly so, to the performance of a contract. 

(b) (1) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR Part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or 
cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, or as may be incorporated for a secondary site of the work, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics. Any wage determination incorporated for a secondary site of the work shall be effective from the first day on which work under the contract was performed at that site and shall be incorporated without any adjustment in contract price or estimated cost. Laborers employed by the construction Contractor or construction subcontractor 
that are transporting portions of the building or work between the secondary site of the work and the primary site of the work shall be paid in accordance with the wage determination applicable to the primary site of the work. 

(2) Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause; also, regular contributions made or 
costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such period. 

(3) Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. Laborers or mechanics performing work in 
more than one classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein; provided, that the employers payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed. 

(4) The wage determination (including any additional classifications and wage rates conformed under paragraph (c) of this clause) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the workers. 

(c) (1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefore only when all the following criteria have been met: 

(i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination. 

(ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry. 

(iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination. 

(2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by 
the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the: 

Wage and Hour Division 
Employment Standards Administration 
U.S. Department of Labor 
Washington, DC 20210 

The Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 

(3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 

(4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) determined pursuant to subparagraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this clause shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification. 

(d) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof. 

(e) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; provided, That the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Vendor A </em>[NAME Redacted] is a SDVOSB distributor of laboratory equipment and supplies.&nbsp; A question from reviewing your solicitation is whether the government would accept a distributor of the product.&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">"YES"</span> The specifications seem to require a manufacturer only who is ISO9001 certified. We have many sterilizer models available from the leading manufacturers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our capabilities in this area are extensive, and the quick-scan introduction attached may help convey some of our capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Vendor Question #2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to more fully prepare a quotation for the Solicitation HU0001-09-T-0005, for a steam sterilizer, I need to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="1">
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">Must this unit be new, or will a refurbished/remanufactured unit be acceptable? </span>I would say that it has to be "new" because it would present an unfair advantage to competing vendors who are unable to produce something remanufactured.</li>
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">The solicitation spells out that the unit should be "...<em>64" H x 23" W x 29" D. Unit must not exceed 24" in width due to space limitations at the location of installation</em>."&nbsp; We have a Push button unit for a 20x20x38 with the exterior dimensions of: 65"h x 28"w x 33" Length-can we use this as an acceptable alternative? </span>This is a mistake. It should have read: 34" because the doorway leading into the room gives a clearance of only 34". What we don't want is a side-mounted control box that would take up more width than the unit itself. We want top-mounted or a face mounted control panel.</li>
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">Must the manufacturer be ISO 9001 certified? </span>NO!</li>
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">Do you need a cart and carriage? </span>NO!</li>
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">Do you need an old unit disconnected and removed? </span>NO!</li>
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">Please affirm that you do not need installation and that you will accept delivery of the unit to your location. </span>We do not require installation or delivery to the room, just delivery to the Loading Dock. We have Electricians, Plumbers, and Bio-Medical Maintenance Technicians who can carry out the installation. The offer should only bid on the raw purchase and nothing else.</li>
<li style="COLOR: red; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="color: windowtext;">The specification calls for all stainless steel? Are you running RO/Di water to the unit? </span>"NO"<span style="color: windowtext;"> If you are, then you would need <em>all</em> stainless steel construction for the chamber, jacket and including piping- which is significantly more expensive.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are not going to run RO/Di water through the unit, then we have a unit that has an all stainless steel chamber with a carbon steel jacket, and stainless steel cabinet mounting, is that acceptable? </span>"YES"</li>

<p>As stated by vendor:</p>
<p>I have a few questions about the requirements for this unit.</p>
<p>1: Should catch pan be removable while animal is inside?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: You will need a grate type floor that the animal will be on, and we would like to know if you have any requirements as to the size of the holes in the grate?( Size of the grating?)</p>
<p>THE CURRENT FLOORING WE HAVE IS RUBBERIZED DIAMOND FLOORING. THE DIAMONDS MEASURE 1" WIDE X 2" LONG. THIS HAS WORKED WELL FOR US AND WOULD BE APPROPRIATE MOVING FORWARD.</p>
<p>3: Is there a total weight limit for the complete unit?</p>
<p>NO, AS LONG AS SOMEONE CAN PUSH IT ON THEIR OWN.</p>
<p>4: Can the catch pan drop down between the casters, or must it be on top of the casters.</p>
</span>YES.</p>
<p>THE CART&nbsp;MUST MEET THE MEASUREMENTS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND THE CATCH PAN TO COVER THE ENTIRE BOTTOM OF THE CAGE AS TO AVOID ANY UNPLEASANT ACCIDENTS DURING TRANSPORT.</p>

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS: Project ZHTV060027. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The Period of Performance is 270 days.</p>
<p><br />NAICS CODE: 238210. Size Standard $14M. Install Duplicate Electrical feed to Museum of the Air Force, Area B. Install cable, duct, and padmount switches to create new feed to existing loop circuits serving Museum of the Air Force and The Prairies. Load growth at these sites will cause the existing 250 kcmil cable to be insufficient to serve both loads if one side of the loop fails. Due to the long length of cable feeding these sites, repairs could take 1-3 days, and there is too much load to be restored by portable generator. The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>
<p>Special Requirement/Considerations: Work will need to be coordinated with the Exterior Electric Shop to allow them to switch electrical loads to accommodate the work with minimal customer electrical outages. Work on switches where power outages are required will need to be scheduled to minimize disruption. Work will require electrical contractor experienced with work on 12kV underground systems.</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:&nbsp; CDC hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excludes</span> the Section 508 template from the Technical Proposal 75-page limit.&nbsp; Offerors are instructed to include the completed Section 508 Template as an Appendix (appropriately identified) to the Technical Proposal.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only this Section 508 Appendix is excluded</span> from the 75-page limit; any other Appendix an offeror includes in the Technical Proposal is subject to the 75-page limit.</p>
<p>CDC&nbsp;has prepared&nbsp;Amendment 0003 (attached) to incorporate this&nbsp;change to the solicitation. The change is added to page 51, Subfactor 1, subparagraph 4).&nbsp; Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/20/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received additional questions and has prepared its response provided as an attachment.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Amendment 0002</strong></span> is also attached to incorporate changes to the solicitation arising from the questions received to date. Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>
<p>_________________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/20/2009 notice _________</p>
<p><strong>5/18/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received another question which is included in the attached response.</p>
<p>Also, CDC has made&nbsp;changes to the Statement of Objectives (SOO) which&nbsp;are included in the attached Amendment (i.e. SF 30).&nbsp; Offerors shall acknowledge the Amendment as per instructions contained in block 11 of the SF 30 (attached).&nbsp; The changes in the SOO are located in paragraphs 9 and 10.&nbsp; The proposal due date remains the same.</p>
<p>____________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/18/09 notice _______________</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/13/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Understanding that questions are not due until June 1, 2009, we have a question with regard to the page limit that we believe is critical to offerors as they work to prepare their best responses to this RFP. We wish to clarify that the page limit is indeed 75 pages, inclusive of appendices. Based on experiences bidding other CDC RFPs where this language was included in the RFP and then subsequently amended so that appendices were considered outside the 75-page limit, we wish to clarify this as early as possible in the bid process. To learn that the appendices are excluded the page limit after June 1 will make it virtually impossible for offerors to respond appropriately by the June 22 deadline.
<p>If the page limit stands as it is currently stated in the RFP, we appreciate the clarification and will respond accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>CDC response</strong>:&nbsp;reference Section 'L' on page 50 of the Solicitation, subparagraph L.9 which reads:</p>
<p>L.9 Proposal page format:</p>
<p>Pages shall be 8 &frac12; x 11, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch. Page fold-outs will count as 2 pages. Text printed on double-sided pages will also count as two pages. <strong>Where a page limit applies</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the page limit includes</strong></span> cover letter, table of contents, index, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appendices</span></strong>, attachments, illustrations, charts, tables, diagrams <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and all other documents</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solicitation stipulates a <strong>75-page limit</strong> for the <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>; thus, since a page limit applies to the Technical Proposal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then appendices are included in the page limit</strong></span> pursuant to the instructions in subparagraph L.9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp; End of 5/13/09 Amendment ----</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Notice</strong>:</p>
<p>The solicitation # <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHS-RFP-2009-FTG7</span>&nbsp;is hereby posted as of May 08, 2009.&nbsp; The solicitation is&nbsp;attached to this amendment as MS Word file. Reference Section "L" of the solicitation for detailed&nbsp;proposal preparation and submission instructions.</p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question from an interested offeror</strong>:</p>
<p>According to a recent news article, CDC has received a database from FEMA that is very important for conducting the Children's Health Study. We are wondering whether CDC can release information on the contents of the database (e.g., variables that will be provided to the contractor) before the RFP is released.</p>
<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The United States Postal Service intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract(s) with flexibility in purchase options to one or more prequalified suppliers.

As the project advances it is anticipated that six to twenty-five sites ranging from 100 kilowatts to 2 megawatts will be added to the program every two years.  The determining program expansion factors are dependant on the Postal Service requirements to reduce its greenhouse gas and carbon footprint and the financial value to the USPS.

<DESC><p>Justification for Selection NL115 Ethernet &amp; Compact Flash Module</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HCN-M climate monitoring sites are designed to make high quality temperature and precipitation measurements to track the regional climate signals for the USA.&nbsp; One of the requirements of the station is to provide a near continuous record of these measurements.&nbsp; The data is transmitted each hour by GOES satellite and is recorded and archived at the NCDC.&nbsp; If transmissions fail for any reason the data is kept for long term retrieval on the datalogger at the site.&nbsp; Because of the size of the datastream it is possible that the data stored at the site will exceed the capacity of the memory built into the datalogger.&nbsp; The NL115 and associated Compact Flash Card will dramatically increase the storage capacity of the system on site.&nbsp; Another advantage of the compact flash cards is the data is stored external of the datalogger so if there is a datalogger failure the data will be recoverable.&nbsp; Another advantage is the compact flash card could be replaced by the site host when requested and returned to ATDD for data recovery.&nbsp; This is much more efficient than the processes used in the past to recover data from sites.&nbsp; It will result in cost savings andd also increase the completeness of the data record for the HCN-M network.&nbsp; The NL115 is sold exclusively by the manufacturer of the datalogger, Campbell Scientific, Inc.</p>

In addition to Small Businesses, this Synopsis is encouraging responses from qualified and capable Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Small Businesses, Small Business Joint Ventures, Consortiums and Teaming Partners. This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether or not there are qualified and capable Small Businesses to provide the aforementioned service.</p>
<p>Two or more qualified and capable small businesses must submit responses that demonstrate their qualifications to make a determination for a small business set-aside. Responses must demonstrate the company's ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting clause (FAR 52.219-14). Interested small businesses meeting the small business standard of NAICS code 517919 are requested to submit a response to the Contracting Officer within 7 calendar days of issuance of this RFI. Late responses will not be considered. Responses should provide the business's DUNS number and CAGE code and include a statement of self certification under the NAICS code. Additionally, responses should include recent (within the past three years or work that is on-going) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work. Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered. Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.</p>
<p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to submit a maximum 8 page statement of their knowledge and capabilities to perform the following:</p>
<p>1. AFTAC requires a communications network that can transport analog/digital formatted seismic data, voice, and files to, from, and between AFTAC and its seismic monitoring locations. AFTAC has an alternate operating location for data transmittal at Goodfellow AFB, TX. The communications network must have the ability to transmit data from the service points to Goodfellow AFB when AFTAC's primary location at Patrick AFB, FL is inoperable. The network will also be utilized on a case-by-case base to provide administrative services (.gov e-mail, file transfer) for AFTAC Detachment personnel located at the seismic monitoring locations. AFTAC network personnel will be responsible for establishing virtual private networks across the USAEDS network to provide these services.</p>
<p>2. Patrick AFB, Goodfellow AFB, and Seismic monitoring locations will be referred to as Service Points (SP) A, B, and so forth from this point forward. AFTAC (SP-A) at Patrick AFB, FL requires a global, full duplex, full period communications network connecting multiple SP's (point to point and point to multi-point) together. The government desires a digital/IP-based network and shall use 100% of the service 100% of the time to transmit and receive mission data. At SP locations where the seismic data is in an analog format, the contractor must provide analog to digital converters to transform the data into a digital format prior to entering the USAEDS communications network. Once the data reaches its destination, it must be converted back to analog for final processing. (This conversion only takes place at a few locations. All data going to SP-A or SP-B at (Goodfellow AFB, TX) will not require a conversion.)</p>
<p>3. The contractor-provided network must be able to provide the government with 3-5 IP addresses per SP location. AFTAC network personnel will configure government furnished equipment (GFE) with these IP addresses and coordinate with the contractor's network personnel to establish destination routing. The contractor is required to provide a network that is protected against malice, intrusion, and cyber threats. The contractor must have process controls (firewalls, access control lists, etc.) to reduce the likelihood that its products and services contain malicious functions, control the quality, configuration, and security of components or subcomponents, and have process controls to ensure that personnel in design, configuration management, test, operations, and security positions are trustworthy. The contractor must protect the USAEDS communications network against cyber threats. Threats to control systems can come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled employees, and malicious intruders. To protect against these threats, it is necessary to create a secure cyber-barrier.</p>
<p>4. In addition to the baseline requirements, the government retains the right to add or delete service points, and/or upgrade/change the data rates of the remote sites as required during the life of the contract. Any additions, changes, or upgrades that incur additional costs must be jointly agreed upon between the contractor and the government, and approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>5. SP-A continuously receives data from all other Service Points. SP-B is the backup to SP-A, and shall have the networking capability to receive data from all Service Points upon network failures, or when requested via telephone, or e-mail notification from the Government's technical representative or Systems Control Element. SP-B is a hot stand by for SP-A. SP-B shall be configured to assume the communications responsibilities of SP-A either instantaneously, or within one hour of being notified by the government to swing traffic. Conditions causing SP-B to be activated are communications outages, communication exercises, weather events, disaster preparedness activities, etc.</p>
<p>6. This network requires diversity in routing and network path to ensure redundancy for mission data traffic.</p>
<p>7. The contractor has the choice of providing satellite, frame, leased-line, or MPLS services for any service point. Service points are identified with the type of communications services they are currently operating on. Some locations are extremely remote to civilization or reliable telephone line access.</p>
<p>a. The contractor will furnish all SATCOM and network equipment required to transmit and receive data from one service point to another. The demarcation point will be an interface for GFE off of the contractor's network device (netmodem, router, switch, or hub). <br />b. Protocols the government will utilize: TCP/IP Protocols (I.E. UDP, Telnet, FTP, SMTP, VoIP)<br />c. Maintenance Support (On call or Onsite country): The contractor will be responsible for maintaining equipment and responding to outages. The contractor must be able to either remotely repair or physically repair outages within as quickly as possible. <br />d. 24/7 Helpdesk Support: Support required monitoring the network, calling up maintenance, and providing notifications and updates to key government personnel.</p>
<p>8. The following support is required for each service point:</p>
<p>a. Monthly bandwidth (include separate line for foreign segment and landing fees)<br />b. Monthly, quarterly, or annual unscheduled / preventive maintenance fees<br />c. 24/7/365 Helpdesk services fees</p>
<p>9. The contractor will be responsible for all host nation approval and connection authority certificates for SP's residing in foreign countries. The contractor is also responsible for all fees and tariffs levied by foreign governments when pursuing telecommunications services and satellite frequency requests. These approvals/permissions must be verifiable by government personnel.</p>
<p>10. Below is a list of service point locations. This is not an all-inclusive list of SP's. It is a large portion to aide in determining what is required to provide the necessary services, and the regions of the world where the service will be provided.</p>
<p>Service Point A (Frame Relay/MPLS)<br />Patrick AFB, AFTAC<br />NPA/NPX: 321-494<br />CIR Data Rate: T1 (1.544Mb)<br />Backup Circuit: T1 (1.544Mb)</p>
<p>Service Point B (Frame Relay/MPLS)<br />Goodfellow AFB, TX, Alternate Location<br />NPA/NPX: 915-654<br />CIR Data Rate: T1 (1.544Mb)<br />Backup Circuits: T1 (1.544Mb)</p>
<p>Service Point A will receive traffic from all Service Points with the exception of Service Point B. Service Point B is a standby for Service Point A. Service Point B will also have the ability to provide other services (SMTP, UDP, FTP, etc.) to some of the Service Points. Therefore, Service Point B must remain an active circuit in conjunction with Service Point A.</p>

<DESC>The contractor shall provide Architectural & Engineering design services necessary to provide construction documents, drawings and specifications, for the construction of a  second Data Center in the western U.S. as part of the plan to provide for a modern and redundant facility to support the Department of State computing and Information Technology needs. 

The current Beltsville Information Management Center (BIMC), along with the data center at the State Departments Harry S Truman (HST) building provide processing and storage for the Departments Enterprise Level Computer Systems.  Buildings at BIMC and HST are repurposed mainframe structures with the power systems that are highly inefficient that will no longer support growth.  The purpose of this project is to provide a second redundant data center site.  

The Enterprise Server Operations Center (ESOC) program supports consolidated data center and server management for both classified and unclassified computing.  Centralization of the Departments domestic data centers through the Data Center Consolidation (DCC) program is an extension of the ESOC.  These two programs together support many critical Department systems such as SMART, Visa, Passport, Blackberry, eMail, ONE (Remote Access) and IT Desktop Consolidation Support Servers.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This task order was awarded as Time and Materials because the nature of the USAID mission and its dynamic and changing priorities, based on Global needs and changing Foreign Policy events, made it difficult to predict requirements with enough certainty to allow a Firm Fixed Price task order to be issued.  Performance metrics were established to ensure measurable outcomes and high quality performance.

The extension to the contract is required in order to prevent a disruption in services. Having an on-board janitorial contractor is critical in ensuring that the buildings are kept in a clean and sanitary condition. Without the extension of services, there would be a lapse in service, and unclean / unhealthy conditions could lead to possible injury or spread of contagins resulting in illness or death.</p>
