<DESC>Special Note: Reference Original CBDNet Posting of Synopsis December 17, 2001, against Submission Number SN5149S5.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to solicit proposals for a five-year, Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC or IDIQ), utilizing either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Reimbursement (cost-plus-fixed-fee) (CPFF), Cost Reimbursement-no fee, pricing/payment methods for task orders to be issued. We anticipate that the solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2002. This RFP incorporates the services previously synopsized under M/OP-01-994 for Womens Legal Rights. USAID will be making multiple awards (up to six) for technical assistance and advisory services to support mission in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development to help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S. development assistance programs. [The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities. The quick-response short- and long-term technical services into five major areas:(1)Technical Assistance and Training;(2)Legal;(3)Communications and Outreach (including conference planning and implementation);(4) Grants; and(5)Research. USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S. small businesses, U.S. small disadvantaged businesses, U.S. women-owned small businesses, and U.S. HUBZone small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns. To help identify potential subcontractors, a list of all organizations requesting a copy of the solicitation will be included with each solicitation issued. By providing the list, USAID does not endorse the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID verify the claimed status of the organizations. Necessarily, the list will contain the names of only those organizations known prior to the issuance of the solicitation. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be honored. The preferred method of distribution of USAID procurement information is via the Internet or by request of a solicitation on a 3.5 Floppy Disk. Receipt of this RFP through the Internet must be confirmed by written notification to the contact person noted below if you wish to be notified of any amendments to the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation document to ensure that it is been received from the internet in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.

TESTING:  A first article (a completely assembled prototype of two isolators and support rack) shall be constructed and approved before the remainder of the items on the delivery order is shipped.  Upon approval of the prototype units, the Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor a release order (a statement acknowledging acceptance of the first article and requesting shipment of the balance of the delivery order).  The Contracting Officer will test the first article unit for (1) compliance with these specifications, and (2) air leakage.  The tests will be conducted within seven days after delivery.  This leakage test will be done with all ports sealed and with dry, clean gaskets.  The isolator unit shall be pressurized to 2 inches W.C. with air.  The air supply shall be turned off and the isolator static pressure measured after 15 minutes.  A leakage of 25% of the original pressure will be the maximum acceptable leakage.  In the event the first article is not approved due to a minor defect (one not likely to reduce materially the usability of the unit for its intended purpose, or is a departure from the established standards having little bearing of the effective use or operation of the unit), the Contractor shall modify, repair, or replace the article for a subsequent inspection within 30 days of receipt of notice of rejection.  In the event the first article is not approved due to a major defect (one likely to result in failure, or to reduce materially the usability of the unit for its intended purpose), the Contractor shall replace the article for a subsequent inspection within 30 days of receipt of notice of rejection.  The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer a schedule of corrective actions anticipated by the Contractor within ten days of receipt of the notice of rejection.  Acceptance of defective material is not permitted under any circumstances.  The isolators not passing this test will be returned at the Contractor’s expense.  The approved first article will serve as the manufacturing model and count as part of the production quantity.  Failure of the first article to pass inspection after three testing procedures (either to modified or repaired first articles or to additional first articles) will be indicative of the Contractor’s inability to meet the contract requirements and shall constitute grounds for termination for default in accordance with the termination for cause clause of this contract.  Q.  DELIVERY:  The Government requires delivery of a fully operational cage ready for first article testing within 45 days of contract award.  When the unit is shipped, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer notice that it has been shipped and the anticipated delivery date.  After successful first article testing is completed, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor of the results of the inspection through a release order, upon receipt of which the Contractor should proceed with the delivery of units remaining on the initial delivery order.  These units shall be delivered within 60 days of the receipt of the release order.  (vii) Delivery shall be FOB Destination, 934 College Station Road, Athens, Georgia, within 60 days of contract award.  Acceptance shall be made at destination.  See additional information elsewhere in this solicitation regarding delivery of the different units.  (viii) The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>Special Note: Reference Original CBDNet Posting of Synopsis December 17, 2001, against Submission Number SN5149S5.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to solicit proposals for a five-year, Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC or IDIQ), utilizing either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Reimbursement (cost-plus-fixed-fee) (CPFF), Cost Reimbursement-no fee, pricing/payment methods for task orders to be issued. We anticipate that the solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2002. This RFP incorporates the services previously synopsized under M/OP-01-994 for Womens Legal Rights. USAID will be making multiple awards (up to six) for technical assistance and advisory services to support mission in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development to help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S. development assistance programs. [The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities. The quick-response short- and long-term technical services into five major areas:(1)Technical Assistance and Training;(2)Legal;(3)Communications and Outreach (including conference planning and implementation);(4) Grants; and(5)Research. USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S. small businesses, U.S. small disadvantaged businesses, U.S. women-owned small businesses, and U.S. HUBZone small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns. To help identify potential subcontractors, a list of all organizations requesting a copy of the solicitation will be included with each solicitation issued. By providing the list, USAID does not endorse the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID verify the claimed status of the organizations. Necessarily, the list will contain the names of only those organizations known prior to the issuance of the solicitation. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be honored. The preferred method of distribution of USAID procurement information is via the Internet or by request of a solicitation on a 3.5 Floppy Disk. Receipt of this RFP through the Internet must be confirmed by written notification to the contact person noted below if you wish to be notified of any amendments to the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation document to ensure that it is been received from the internet in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  USAID is not obligated to award a contract.
