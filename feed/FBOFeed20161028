<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) and is not a Solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP). Responses to this NOCA are strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government.
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Direct Attack Division, Hard Target Munitions Branch intents to award a production contract to the Boeing Company located at 6200 James S Mcdonnell Blvd, Saint Louis, MO 63134 for the procurement of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) system. The Period of Performance for the effort is twenty-four months from award of the contract until delivery of the first all-up round.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort is 332993; with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This NOCA neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government to any specific acquisition approach. This NOCA is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment to a contract by the Government.</p>
<p>The contractor shall manage the manufacture, integration, and delivery of ten (10) GBU-57 MOP weapons, to include all components, subassemblies and associated hardware necessary to deliver the all-up rounds. The requirement all includes spare tail-kits.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical challenges of this planned contract, proprietary data is involved for which the<br />Government has only limited rights. Therefore, the Government does not possess, and will not be able to provide a technical data package to potential offerors relative to the GBU-57 MOP system.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of potential sources. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting point of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Ms. Jill Willinghamallen, AFLCMC/AQP, phone 937-255-5472.</p>
<p>Interested and capable sources are encouraged to respond to this synopsis with a Statement of Capability. In addition to a Statement of Capabilities, firms responding to this announcement should include company name, CAGE code, point of contact, address, and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. Please limit your Statement of Capability to no more than 10 single spaced, 10 point font typed pages. If e-mailing your Statement of Capability, please send it in a PDF or MS Word format. Responses should be submitted to Stephanie Mills, Contracting Officer by e-mail at stephanie.mills@us.af.mil no later than 12 November 2016.</p>

Destination: SW3211; 19. Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email:gregory.oneal@us.af.mil.

Mobile access must be available via one s device with access to the library s web page or through the vendor s app for any JJP user deciding to download the app making it available on their personal or VA mobile device as well (allowing app to be downloaded up to two separate devices).
The product must provide links and be integrated with existing National Veterans Affairs databases including OvidMD* and VisualDX*. OvidMD is a clinical, evidence-based tool that combines content from MEDLINE, and Ovid journals. Quickly access current journal research, evidence based guidelines, and eBooks with full-text links. VisualDX is an image-based differential diagnosis tool that is designed to help quickly identify dermatological diseases or conditions at the point of care. It includes more than 16,000 images of over 900 visually identifiable diseases, drug reactions, and infections.
The product must provide clinical decision support, point of care, online database of clinical topical articles, and associated graphs, tables, images, etc. that support the context of the written material. Also, it must provide a core set of clinical resources to be used by clinicians in patient care. 
Resources must be accurate, authoritative, relevant and current. The sources must be well-regarded in their medical subject fields.   When available, any images, tables and diagrams must be included.
The database must provide patient level health articles for providers to use in discussions with their patients for patient education purposes. Additionally, this database must provide ACCME-accredited AMA PRA Category Continuous Medical Education (CME) points per topic reviewed for search(es) performed.
The product must focus on internal medicine and subspecialties including but not limited to cardiology, dermatology, sleep medicine, emergency medicine, endocrinology, rheumatology, gynecology, infectious diseases, oncology, gastroenterology, hematology, and hospital medicine.
Statistical data must be available in both automated monthly reports as well as allow for the librarians to be able to create additional reports as may be required during the month for all types of usage available (CME, onsite, mobile etc.). Availability of usage statistics at an IP level is required.
The navigation within the clinical decision support tool must be logical and easy, providing access to topics and subtopics. Topic links or indexing must retrieve electronic content of high relevance quickly that is  user friendly  with help and direction aids.
The vendor must offer training services for the product on an as-requested basis.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Mr. Jonathan L. Fiechter, Falls Church, Virginia, to perform a critical assessment of OCC's implementation of the recommendations to improve supervisory effectiveness in "An International Review of OCC's Supervision of Large and Midsize Institutions" (December 4, 2013). Specific tasks consist of reviewing, analyzing and assessing OCC's actions in response to the Peer Review Report; conducting interviews with various individuals and groups within the OCC; and developing a final report. Mr. Fiechter performed the initial peer review along with a team of international regulators. He, along with the other individuals who conducted the initial assessment, is uniquely qualified to perform the follow-on assessment because the group has the expert knowledge and understanding of the initial review, its findings and appropriate steps that should have been taken to implement the recommendations. Performance of the work by the original team will ensure that the integrity of the review process is maintained. Internal and external parties will know that the OCC relied on the same individuals who performed the 2013 review to check that work rather than relying upon different individuals to perform the assessment. The period of performance for this requirement is November 9, 2016 through November 30, 2016. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued.

DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for project number 596A4-17-103 that requires Architect/Engineering (A/E) Design Services to  RENOVATE CHEMO INFUSION ANTE ROOM  at the Lexington VA Medical Center   Cooper Division.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. ONLY THE A/E FIRMS RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BY SUBMITTING AN SF330 PACKAGE ON TIME WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR INITIAL EVALUATION. FOLLOWING INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE A/E FIRMS AND THEIR SF330S,  A SOLICITATION FOR A PRICE PROPOSAL WILL BE SENT TO THE HIGHEST TECHNICALLY RATED A/E FIRM TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF SERVICE(S) REQUIRED. 

The A&E Services contract that is anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6 and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6.  In accordance with FAR 36.209  Construction Contracts With Architect-Engineer Firms , no contract for the construction of a project shall be awarded to the firm that designed the project or its subsidiaries or affiliates, except with the approval of the head of the agency or authorized representative.  
A/E DESIGN SERVICES SCOPE:  Modify existing Ante Room to be compliant with USP 797 and USP 800 standards, whichever is the more stringent. Construct Clean Room with access to maintain positive/negative air flow between ante room and regular use area.  (Affected areas would directly affect and include the following rooms in Pharmacy: A-190, A190A, A-190B, and A-190C).  

USP standards apply for Pharmacy service practice and operations. Architectural, Mechanical, and Electrical updates are required to provide correct air quality and workspace for IV preparation. Existing Chemo Infusion Room is not compliant with existing standards (USP 797/USP 800.) Upgrade current Pharmacy Infusion and Chemo room to meet USP 800 Standards. Approximately 1000 SF space requires ante-room entrance separation for both Infusion (Positive Pressure) and Chemo (Negative pressure). Presently Chemo is entered from Infusion which is entered from Ante Room.  

Analysis and design changes to the HVAC system together with any related fire safety changes to meet current standards is the primary scope.  In addition, the local Physical Security system/subsystem components shall be investigated for code compliance and VHA design guidelines compliance.  It will also be required to incorporate automatic door openers for touch free operation where standards permit. Coordination with VA Interiors will be required for architectural finishes and possible finish flooring changes in this entry area.

Project design shall clearly show work required, Phasing of work so as to not impede any routine staff operations, and instructions to construction contractor regarding how to accomplish the necessary renovations in a 24/7 medical environment taking into consideration demolition, dust control, infection control, and specialized facility requirements as discussed with VA staff.  Also included will be limitations, e.g. work required to be completed outside of standard administrative hours, work limited to periods shorter than a single shift, etc., for specific locations in the project. 

END OF DESIGN SERVICES SCOPE

Digital copies of the as-builts are limited. The consultant will be expected to fully investigate and confirm the validity of hard copy as-builts and other drawings. This will include independent investigation of the VAMC s flat files by the consultant to determine and procure the information required for the complete design.
All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73 the total cost of the architect or engineer services contracted for must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-2 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated AE firm selected to complete the design.
Interested firms should submit their current SF-330 to matthew.whisman@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due on November 14, 2016 at 11:00 AM (EST).  Use the instructions located in section eleven (11) below for submitting your SF-330.
Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers

Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f), 52.214-7, and 52.215-1(c) (3).Â  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.
Â 
Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
Â  
To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.Â  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Parts 14.406 and FAR 15.207(c ). 

The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.

Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.

<CONTACT>Kevin Alvarez , Contract Specialist, Email kevin.alvarez@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Human Metabolome Technologies America, Inc., 24 Denby Rd Ste 217, Boston, MA, 02134-1606, to provide F-Scope Metabolomic Analysis services to NHLBI's Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The DIR's Proteomics Core provides DIR researchers with access to mass spectrometry for identification and quantitation of proteins and their posttranslational modifications. In addition to providing researchers with access to state-of-the-art equipment, the Core conducts a variety of mass spectrometric analyses with the exception of capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for targeted analysis.</p>
<p>CE-MS is a relatively new technology that produces high separation efficiency and molecular mass information in a single analysis. It has proven to be much more effective than traditional LC- or GC-MS technologies in separating a unique set of metabolites. F-Scope analysis is a specialized form of CE-MS designed specifically for the study of hydrophilic and polar metabolites in biological samples.<br />There is great demand throughout the DIR for F-Scope analysis, and, because the Proteomics Core is not equipped to perform such analyses, the DIR must outsource all requests for F-Scope analysis to a contractor.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain dual-mode F-Scope analysis for 200 biological samples to aid in the research of hydrophilic and polar metabolites throughout the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>F-Scope analysis is a proprietary technology solely owned and operated by Human Metabolome Technologies, America (HMT). Although there is a small pool of companies that provide CE-MS targeted analysis, only HMT's F-Scope technology is capable of providing highly textured, minimally biased portrayals of hydrophilic and polar metabolites in host substances using complementary chromatographic and spectroscopic technologies, and strong post-machine statistical interrogation. No other CE platform on the market is capable of providing similar results. As a result, HMT is the only company capable of meeting the Government's need.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $15.0 million. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-90 (October 25th, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by November 7, 2016 at 9:00AM EST and must reference synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-HL-2017-017-KMA.  Responses shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6127, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Kevin Alvarez. Responses may be submitted electronically to kevin.alvarez@nih.gov.  Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  "All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency."</p>

<DESC>NOTE: This Pre-solicitation Notice references information resulting from Sources Sought Notice N0018914S2111 issued on 16 September 2014.

The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk (FLCN), Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office formerly announced a Sources Sought Notice (refer to N0018914S2111) to identify potential business sources capable of providing services to the Navy Education and Training Command (NETC), Pensacola, FL in support of NETCâ€™s domain-wide Information Technology (IT) and Support Service requirements. 
Based upon the responses received, as well as thorough market research conducted, adequate competition is anticipated for the acquisition, to the point where an unrestricted, full and open competition is expected to yield extensive participation.
 After examining the history of this acquisition, both among small business primes and subcontractors, as well as the small business responses related to the Sources Sought Notice, it was determined that there is no reasonable expectation of sufficient small business participation that would justify setting aside the acquisition entirely.  

The conclusion reached from an assessment of those small business firms who responded to the Sources Sought Notice, as well as several other small business firmsâ€™ contract experience, is that there is no reasonable expectation of two or more small business concerns being capable of participation in the entire requirement to the point where a full blown set aside would be warranted.
 In light of the conclusion reached, further consideration of those responses to the Sources Sought Notice revealed that many small businesses were interested in the instant requirement, or at the very least parts of the requirement, to the point where a comprehensive review of the acquisition was warranted. The goal of such a review was to determine whether any areas of the requirement could be set aside exclusively for small business concerns. 

Accordingly, in an effort to maximize competition and promote greater small business participation, a determination was been made to split the requirement and solicit separate Request For Proposals (RFP) as follows: (1) N00189-15-R-Z008 for IT Support Services on a full and open, unrestricted basis; and (2) N00189-15-R-Z038 for IT Business Support Services as a total small business set-aside.
  

The remainder of this Pre-Solicitation Notice will provide information in reference to RFP N00189-15-R-Z038 for IT Business Support Services ONLY. For information on the IT Support Services solicitation, refer to RFP N00189-15-R-Z008.

The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk (FLCN), 700 Robbins Avenue Philadelphia, PA 19111 intends to solicit on a full and open competition basis, in accordance with FAR, Part 15 procedures, for Information Technology Business Support Services (RFP # N00189-15-R-Z038) for the Naval Education  and  Training Command (NETC), Pensacola, FL, in support of Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education (MPTE) Information Technology Business requirements. 

NETCâ€™s Information Technology (IT) enterprise site is at the Naval Education  and  Training Command (NETC) located in Pensacola, FL where there are major Echelon III and IV commands with focal points geographically located at San Diego, CA and Norfolk, VA; Naval Service Training Command (NSTC) located at Great Lakes, IL; three Training Support Centers, 13 Learning Centers, and (238) two hundred thirty eight Learning Sites located throughout the United States.

NETC requires a comprehensive contract for support of the diverse information technology (IT) business demands of NETC and all organizations within the MPTE.
 The resultant contract will allow NETC/MPTE activities to order support services by means of task orders with specifically defined scope of work, schedule, and deliverables as needed. FLCN Philadelphia Office will be the ordering office for all requirements generated by NETC and the MPTE enterprise.  

A Single, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract, which would allow for both Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders providing for five years of performance â€“ anticipated to begin on 01 May 2016 and continue through 30 April 2021 â€“ is anticipated to be awarded. 
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519 and the size standard is $27.5 million.
 For planning purposes only, it is estimated that the requirement will require 397,700 man-hours of service over the life of the contract. Offerors shall be required to submit both price and non-price proposals. The Navyâ€™s evaluation of proposals will consider the offerorâ€™s non-price proposal to be more important than the cost/price proposal. 

RFP number N00189-15-R-Z038 will be made available electronically upon its release to the Navy Electronic Commerce Online. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be established in the RFP. Interested parties may download the RFP upon its issuance to the following website: https://www.neco.navy.mil. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring of the aforementioned website for postings of the solicitation and any amendments thereto.
 The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. 

Please direct any and all questions to Mr. Franklin Andujar at franklin.andujar@navy.mil ONLY after reading the details in the Solicitation when it is released and becomes available in NECO.

<DESC><p>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.</p>
<p>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP website at www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP website no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 5, 2017. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. It is the sole responsibility of the proposer to make certain the proposal is properly received by SERDP. Awards will take the form of contracts. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals or travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals.</p>
<p>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $10.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.</p>
<p><br />Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the SERDP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.</p>
<p>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $700,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $700,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office website at http://www.usace.army.mil/ HECSA/HECSASmallBusiness provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Please reference Request for Proposal (RFP) number VA-791-17-R-0012. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center (DALC), in support of the Veteran Health Administration (VHA), is intending to contract with qualified dental insurance carriers to administer and provide insurance coverage to eligible VA beneficiaries for VA s Dental Insurance Program (VADIP).

OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE: 

The VA, Health Eligibility Center (HEC), through the DALC intends to contract with qualified dental insurance carriers to administer and provide insurance coverage to eligible VA beneficiaries for VADIP. Coverage for VADIP dental services will be provided in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

HEC serves as VA s national service center for VA health care registration, enrollment, and eligibility activities. HEC also serves as the business owner for administrative information systems supporting the delivery of VA health benefits.Â  HEC achieves VA s gold standard of honoring America s Veterans by providing accurate and timely health care eligibility and enrollment determinations and responsive and respectful customer service.

HEC supports VA s health care delivery system by providing centralized eligibility verification and enrollment processing services. HEC determines a Veteran s eligibility for VA health benefits and facilitates the enrollment process by providing guidance to VA field offices and facilities. HEC also collaborates with VA s Chief Business Office (CBO) and other administrative offices on the implementation of policy. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2016, Public Law Number (Pub.L. 114-218) requires that VA carry out a dental insurance program to continue the dental insurance program which was initiated under Section 510 of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, (Pub.L. 111-163). Pub.L. 111-163 was repealed by Pub.L. 114-218. Under the current statute, the VADIP will continue its direction of assessing the feasibility and advisability of a competitive, private, premium-based dental insurance plan for Veterans enrolled in VA health care and survivors and dependents of Veterans eligible for VA s Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA). The VA will contract with private dental insurers to provide dental insurance coverage for VADIP beneficiaries. The contracted insurers shall also be responsible for administering various aspects of VADIP. VA s primary role in VADIP is administering the contracts with the private insurer(s) and providing the private insurer(s) with eligibility verification of individuals applying for VADIP coverage.

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: 

Denver Acquisition and Logistic Center, 555 Corporate Circle, Golden, CO 80401. 

SOLICITATION DETAILS:

Public Law 114-218 dated July 29, 2016 mandates a program for VA to provide a contracted dental insurance program to Veterans. Since funding has not been appropriated for this program, any resulting contract will be awarded as a no-cost type contract. As such, this procurement is not subject to the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR); however, it will utilize numerous FAR provisions deemed appropriate and relevant to this solicitation.

The North American Classification Code is 524114 and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5M. This is a full and open procurement for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entity(s) who can meet the requirements.  The Government anticipates the award of multiple firm fixed-price with prospective price redetermination type contracts. These will be  no-cost  contracts with one base period and four option periods.

The base contract period will be from the date of contract award through September 30, 2017, with four one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The current statue terminates on December 21, 2021.

Solicitation documents should be available electronically on or about November 15, 2016 at the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov. NO HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. The anticipated closing date is on or about December 15, 2016 and anticipated award date is on or about January 31, 2017. 

The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Jim Moran. Offerors interested in responding to this solicitation should provide their email addresses and contact information to james.moran3@va.gov. The only terms and conditions that will apply to the solicitation and any resultant contracts shall come from the Contracting Officer through the release of the final RFP and any amendments, information received from other than the Contracting Officer to include other VA sources, are not binding on the VA.

All contractors must be registered through the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website as an active contractor in order to be eligible to enter into a contract.Â The CCR website is now part of the System for Award Management (SAM), which is found at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM.Â  Please be sure your company is registered at this website.Â Prospective offerors should complete electronic annual representations and certifications, which is also part of the SAM.Â Due to the limited time offerors have to respond you are encouraged, but not required, to register in advance. 

This announcement is not a request for proposal and does not bind the Government to award any contract.

<DESC><p>F-15 MODE 5 PROGRAM<br />SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) F-15 Division (AFLCMC/WWQ), Wright Patterson Air Base is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources with the expertise, capabilities and experience to meet the requirements of the F-15 Mode 5 Program. This is not a request for proposals and responses will not be considered as a formal offer to the government nor result in a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this synopsis. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. The intent of this notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the appropriate acquisition type for the procurement. A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to full and open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers. This is not a request for proposals, and the Government will not pay for information received. Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the Fed Biz Opps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this Sources Sought. Any information provided in response to this Synopsis will be used for informational purposes only and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and what type of businesses will be used for subcontracting (other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This Sources Sought does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid. Sources Sought issuance does not restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>Instructions for Responses<br />A. Read description of the F-15 Mode 5 Program and its requirements, provided below, to determine if you believe your company has the expertise, capabilities, and experience to perform on this type of effort.</p>
<p>B. If, after reviewing, you believe your company can meet the Mode 5 requirements and you desire to participate in this survey, you may provide documentation that supports your company's expertise, capabilities, and experience. To do so, provide answers to Capabilities and Business Information in accordance with Part II Communication, all shown below.</p>
<p>Program Description<br />The F-15 Program Office anticipates awarding a new contract for the APX-114 Mode 5 upgrade. The Mode 5 IFF upgrade will provide Mode 5 (Level 1) capability for the APX-114 Air-Air Interrogator (AAI) on the F-15 models C/D/E via a hardware retrofit and software upgrade. Sources are sought to provide for the production of APX-114 kits over 3 years, as well as an initial order of brand new APX-114 boxes. In particular, delivery of approximately 27 new APX-114 units will be required while approximately 450 Mode 4 units will be supplied to the offeror for upgrade to Mode 5. The period of performance will be 3 years from time of award. It is anticipated that this is not a commercial item because this item is not used, sold, or made available to the commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>Program Requirements<br />The F-15 fleet currently has the Mode 4 version of APX-114 and APX-119 installed on the aircraft.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government desires to procure the Base Support Services (SBS) on a small business set-aside basis, provided sufficient qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside. Be advised that the U.S. Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if sufficient small businesses do not respond with information to support the set-aside. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. It is a market research tool (FAR Part 10) being used to determine potential firms capable of providing the services described herein prior to determining the method of acquisition and if this requirement can be set-aside to any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3). It is also a tool to elicit feedback on the requirement as detailed in the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS). Feedback is encouraged and appreciated.
<p>This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code(s) is: 561210, Facilities Support Services, with the Small Business size standard of $38.5M.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>A continuing need is anticipated for SBS requirement which is currently being fulfilled by Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Task Order Contract awarded to seven small businesses under contract numbers W9124J-12-D-0003 through W9124J-12-D-0009 with a one year base and four one year options. Task orders issued under the current MATOC range from $4.0M to $11.0M.</p>
<p>IMCOM requires a prime contractor(s) with the capability to manage multiple task simultaneously at multiple locations. The contractor must also be capable of recruiting and providing a team of highly qualified personnel that will be able to handle mobilization, deployment, redeployment and demobilization mission requirements. Often, these requirements are very fluid, dynamic and can vary by installation. The requirements can develop with little warning and in unexpected volumes. The contractor must be able to respond to unexpected surge requirements with adequate numbers of qualified employees, even when the workload volume is at levels not seen before and with very little advance notice.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide as required SBS Services (Garrison Augmentation Support Services) to the following IMCOM Installations 25 locations:</p>
<p>Camp Atterbury, IN Fort Carson, CO<br />Camp Shelby, MS Fort McCoy, WI<br />Fort Bliss, TX Fort Sill, OK<br />Fort Dix, NJ Fort Stewart, GA<br />Fort Hood, TX Fort Benning, GA<br />Fort Knox, KY Fort Polk, LA<br />Fort Lewis, WA Schofield Barracks, HI<br />Fort Bragg, NC Fort Hunter Liggett, CA<br />Fort Drum, NY Fort Campbell, KY<br />Fort Eustis, VA Fort Leonard Wood, MO<br />Gowen Field, ID Camp Roberts, CA<br />Fort Sam Houston, TX Fort Gordon, GA<br />Fort Riley, KS</p>
<p>Services ordered through this requirement relieve mobilized Reserve Component (RC) units and Soldiers providing non--inherently governmental functions addressed in the 12 task areas of the attached draft PWS:</p>
<p>&bull; Task Area 1: Plans <br />&bull; Task Area 2: Training<br />&bull; Task Area 3: Administrative <br />&bull; Task Area 4: Infrastructure Security <br />&bull; Task Area 5: Human Resources <br />&bull; Task Area 6: Finance <br />&bull; Task Area 7: Material Management and Supply <br />&bull; Task Area 8: Services Support (Subsistence, Laundry, and Supply and Warehouse) <br />&bull; Task Area 9: Movements <br />&bull; Task Area 10: Equipment Readiness and Maintenance <br />&bull; Task Area 11: Billeting and Facilities<br />&bull; Task Area 12: Information Management</p>
<p>For additional details regarding this requirement refer to the attached draft PWS.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) on 13 May 2016. Only electronic submissions will be accepted.</p>
<p><br />Interested business concerns should provide a brief "capabilities statement" package (no page limit pages in length, single spaced, and 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the services. A generic capability statement is not acceptable. No particular layout or format is mandated. It is preferred that your firm submits its response in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, or a combination of both and the document must be searchable. The capability statement package shall be sent by email to the following individual::</p>
<p><br />MAJ Todd Gore (todd.e.gore.mil@mail.mil)</p>
<p>Your email subject line should reflect: "(Firm's Name), Response to the Sources Sought Synopsis for the SBS, W9124J-17-R-0001". The size limit of each email, with all attachments, cannot exceed 9 megabytes (MB) due to the Government's email system restrictions. DO NOT SEND ZIPPED FILES. The Government's information network will remove zipped files. If your firm must send two or more emails in order to prevent exceeding the 9 MB restriction, please label each email with: "(Firm's Name) Information and Comments for W9124J-17-R-0001 - Email # 1 of 2, 2 of 2, etc.".</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, provide a response to each of the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Would an Industry Day Forum for this requirement be beneficial (Why or why not)? If an Industry Day were to be held, how many personnel from your company would you anticipate attending? What topics would you like the Government to discuss? If the Industry Day was held in El Paso TX, would you still be willing to attend?</p>
<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor (performing at least 51% of the work) or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>4. What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?</p>
<p>5. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor), skills on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>6. Do you anticipate any new technology(ies) and method(s) that can improve the quality, decrease costs and/or improve efficiency? If yes, what improved approach(s) can be used to provide the services to include significant changes in how the work can be accomplished?</p>
<p>7. Information to help determine if this service is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, etc.</p>
<p>8. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>9. What is a reasonable phase-in period for a contractor to be fully operational at a new MFGI site that was newly activated by the Army?</p>
<p>10. What do you see as the primary risk areas and/or potential issues associated with an acquisition of this type? How do you propose this risk(s) can be mitigated (if any)?</p>
<p>11. Which contract type do you consider most advantageous for this type of requirement (e.g. Cost-type, Firm Fixed-Price (FFP), a combination type contract) and why? Also, if the workload data is insufficient upon release of the RFP, will you submit a proposal with reasonable risk? If not, other than incumbent manning that cannot be provided, what additional data would be required that would assist in your price development? (Please be specific)</p>
<p>12. Provide your input to a source selection method that would provide the best value to the Government. If a full technical/cost/past performance tradeoff is recommended, provide supporting information describing areas where the Government could receive benefit that might relate to an additional expense/cost to the contract.</p>
<p>13. If a contract for services of this type were awarded with a 10 year ordering period, what would be the pros and cons of 10 year contract? What would be the pros and cons of a five year contract?</p>
<p>14. The NAICS code contemplated for this requirement is 561210, Facilities Support Services industry, with a size standard of $38.5M. In your opinion, does this NAICS code fit this requirement? If not, which NAICS code would you suggest and why?</p>
<p>15. Please provide any recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>
<p>Please note: The Army is interested in maximum effective competition. If you feel any of the aspects listed in this announcement unreasonably restrict competition, please submit a Statement of Unreasonable Restrictions to Competition to the MICC Advocate for Competition, Dean Carsello at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil. In your statement, please reference this announcement number and the Army Advertising and Marketing Program. Also, your statement must indicate what element of the planned acquisition specifically is restricting competition and why it is unreasonable.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK


PURPOSE: CONTRACT RESIDENTIAL SERVICES BEDS
The Wilmington Veterans Affairs Medical Center (WVAMC) is seeking Contract Residential Service (CRS) beds for 24 hours a day/7 days a week (24/7). Service provides a community-based early recovery model of supportive housing within the State of Delaware and accessible by public transportation that provides therapeutic and rehabilitative services in a safe environment to homeless, eligible Veterans. 

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain availability of contractors who can provide housing, outreach services, case management services, and rehabilitative services within the State of Delaware. The areas of coverage would be for the counties of Sussex, Kent, and New Castle. Service is for Veterans experiencing homelessness and/or chronic homelessness as defined by the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including Veterans diagnosed with severe mental illness and substance use disorders, in community-based residential facilities.  

BACKGROUND:
The VA has been providing direct and specialized services for homeless Veterans for nearly 25 years.  The Secretary of the VA has set a zero-tolerance policy for homelessness within the Veteran population.  As part of the Plan to End Homelessness among Veterans announced in late 2009, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has been increasing both capacity of existing programs and services offered to program participants.  The plan calls for utilizing new models of care not previously offered by VA.  The Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program is authorized by 38 U.S.C. 2031, under which VA may provide  care and services under section 1710 of this title to veterans suffering from serious mental illness and to veterans who are homeless. 
The duties of, and standards applicable to, non-VA community-based providers is authorized by 38 U.S.C. 501, 2031, part 63.15.

WVAMC is seeking Contractor(s) to assist with the provision of emergency residential placement and treatment services through the Health Care for Homeless Veterans program. WVAMC intends to issue a multiple award contract in order to service veterans in all three counties and all priority groups.  Priority groups are male veterans, female veterans, veterans with a sex offender status, and sites that can house families.  VA is only able to pay for services provided to the veteran themselves. Contract (s) will not exceed a total of 16 homeless Veterans, who need immediate placement in a safe environment with onsite treatment services.  Many of these veterans have co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and other medical conditions. The goal of the HCHV Contracted Residential Services (CRS) is to rapidly stabilize Veterans  medical, mental health, substance abuse and other psychosocial problems in order to place Veterans in other appropriate transitional or permanent housing within 30 to 90 days, but no more than 180 days. Contractor will provide rapid placement of VA-referred Veterans in a safe, residential treatment setting while addressing Veterans  complex needs through on-site case management and therapeutic support services. This housing must meet the criteria established both by HCHV clinical staff and VA fire and safety officials.  

NOTE: Contractors are urged in the strongest terms to carefully review the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work to ensure that all facilities fire and safety and treatment services criteria can be met in a timely way.

Definitions: 

Chronic Homelessness is defined by HUD in 24 CFR parts 91 and 578 to mean a homeless individual with a disability who lives either in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter, or in an institutional care facility if the individual has been living in the facility for fewer than 90 days and had been living in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter immediately before entering the institutional care facility. In order to meet the  chronically homeless  definition, the individual also must have been living as described above continuously for at least 12 months, or on at least four separate occasions in the last 3 years, where the combined occasions total a length of time of at least 12 months. Each period separating the occasions must include at least 7 nights of living in a situation other than a place not meant for human habitation, in an emergency shelter, or in a safe haven.

Contracted Residential Services (CRS) is a community-based early recovery model of supportive housing that serves hard to reach, hard to engage homeless individuals with severe mental illness and substance use disorders.  Many have not been able to comply with traditional program requirements resulting in high use of emergency room and acute care services and more Veterans living on the streets or in shelters. CRS places no treatment participation demands on residents but expects a transition from unsafe and unstable street life to permanent housing and to re-engage with treatment services. 

Contracted Emergency Residential Services (CERS)
CERS programs target and prioritize homeless Veterans transitioning from literal street homelessness, Veterans being discharged from institutions, including those in need of medical respite, and Veterans who recently became homeless and require safe and stable living arrangements while they seek permanent housing. CERS Programs provide low demand time-limited services such as supporting mental health stabilization, Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment services, enhancement of independent living skills, vocational training, and employment services. In some cases, VA may complement the CERS program with added treatment services; such as participation in VA outpatient programs.  Emphasis is placed on referral and placement in permanent housing or longer term residential programs utilizing VA and/or community resources. Lengths of stay in CERS typically range from 30 to 90 days with the option to extend based on clinical need.


BASIC SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACTOR:

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: The contractor must provide Contracted Emergency Residential Services (CERS) to male and/or female veterans.  Contractor is required to ensure that the facility used for this contract meets the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines for accessible accommodations for Veterans with physical limitations or impairments. No funds will be made available for capital improvements under this contract. All of the facility s CRS rooms must be wheelchair accessible, to include entrances/exits, bathroom facilities, and common areas. Veterans must not be segregated from the rest of the facility due to physical disability; they must have the same access to the physical plant as well as the treatment services and supports at the facility as any other resident. 
The contractor will offer a low-demand environment for CERS with a minimum set of rules designed to re-establish trust and engage the Veteran in needed treatment services as follows:
Acceptance of treatment cannot be a condition of admission or continued stay
Abstinence from alcohol or drugs cannot be a condition of admission or continued stay
Repeated admission or past behavior cannot be a condition of admission or continued stay
Demands are kept to a minimum
Rules focus on staff and resident safety
Infractions of rules are used as opportunities for engagement

ROOM AND BOARD: Room and Board shall be accessible to the Veteran 7 days a week and 24 hours per day. Accommodations will include a private or semi-private room (no more than 4 per room) with a bed and other furnishings such as a dresser, storage, and personal linens (towels, pillows, blankets and bed sheets). The environment must be conducive to social interaction, supportive of recovery models and the fullest development of the resident s rehabilitative potential.  Residents must be assisted in maintaining an acceptable level of personal hygiene and grooming.  The Contractor will allow Veteran to store personal belongings for at least 72 hours after formal HCHV discharge. 

MEALS:  Meals shall meet 2015 dietary guidelines set forth by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including any updates made to the guidelines. A minimum of two meals per day must be provided in a setting that encourages social interaction.  In addition, the contractor must provide the availability of snacks of nourishing quality (e.g. fruits, vegetables, protein sources, etc.), between meals and before bedtime for those requiring or desiring additional food, even when it is not medically indicated. There will not be more than a 14 hour span between evening meal and breakfast of the following day. Contractor will provide alternative meals for Veterans with dietary restrictions if medically indicated (e.g. diabetic, renal and soft mechanical diets) and reasonable accommodation for Veterans with cultural/religious preferences around food (e.g. Kosher, Sikh, etc.). If food in centrally prepared, it shall be prepared, served and stored under sanitary conditions. The contractor shall provide storage space in an onsite refrigerator for Veterans to store and freely access personal food. The contractor shall establish and maintain sanitary procedures for washing dishes, cleaning equipment and work areas, and disposing of waste. 

GENDER SPECIFIC CARE PROVISIONS
Special attention needs to be given to meeting the unique treatment needs of homeless women Veterans. These needs often may include assistance with managing sexual trauma, eating disorders, interpersonal violence, and caring for dependents while in treatment. Special emphasis on privacy and security should be noted in mixed-gender facilities. Veteran residents have a right to be treated with dignity in a humane environment that affords them both reasonable protection from harm and appropriate privacy with regard to their personal needs. The living environments of HCHV CRS must include:
Residential room and board in an environment that promotes a lifestyle free of sexual discrimination.
An environment conducive to social interaction, supportive of recovery models and the fullest development of the resident's rehabilitative potential regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
Separate and secure bathroom arrangements to ensure an acceptable level of privacy for personal hygiene and grooming.

LAUNDRY FACILITIES: Contractor must provide laundry facilities and necessary detergent free of charge and adequate for residents to do their own laundry or to have laundry done at minimum one time per week.

TRANSPORTATION: The Contractor will be expected to help the Veteran access public transportation, including providing information and instructions necessary to enable Veterans to utilize public transportation. If VA Liaison and/or other appropriate VA staff determines that adequate public transportation is not available or appropriate for a Veteran, the Contractor shall provide alternative transport by car or taxi between the hours of 08:00am to 10:00pm.  Transportation shall not be a barrier for a Veteran receiving service necessary to reach their treatment goals. Thus, if public transportation isn t appropriate or adequate, then the contractor must have the ability to provide transportation to accommodate scheduled admissions, meetings, housing search, and other appointments in the community and at the local VA facility during business hours and after hours as necessary.  VA staff may also assist with logistical burdens.

ADDITIONAL SERVICES REQUIRED BY CONTRACTOR: 

THERAPEUTIC/REHABILITATIVE SERVICES: Each Veteran must have an Individual Treatment Plan (ITP) completed by the Contractor with input from the Veteran and with consultation by VA Liaison and/or other appropriate VA staff within 72 hours of admission. Therapeutic and, as appropriate, rehabilitative services must be provided by the contractor. Therapeutic and rehabilitative services must be stated in the ITP based on the veteran s needs. Contractor must provide: 
Group Activities: Structured group activities, as appropriate, shall occur at a minimum of two times per month   examples include group therapy, life skills training, social skills training, financial workshops, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, vocational counseling and recreational activities. For the purposes of this contract  House Meetings  and VA Housing Resource Groups may not be counted as a structured group activity. Group Activities should have a therapeutic value and facilitation shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Should a Veteran have mental health, medical, family and/or employment obligations which directly conflicts with their ability to participate with group activities as stated in their ITP, alternate group activities will be arranged and/or the Contractor will clearly document efforts made to accommodate the Veteran.
VA Coordination: Collaboration and coordination with VA program staff, as needed, will include coordination of supportive psychosocial services.  In particular, coordinated efforts must be made with the VA Liaison or Designee and/or other appropriate VA staff around medical, mental health, admission and discharge needs.
Case Management: Case management means arranging, planning, coordinating, or providing direct services and support; referring and providing linkage to VA and non-VA resources, providing crisis management services and monitoring; and intervening and advocating on behalf of veterans to support transportation, credit, legal, and other needs. A thorough written Individualized Care Plan (ITP) will be developed within 72 business hours of admission for each Veteran. This will include structured individual case management on at least a weekly basis to address the Veteran s psychosocial needs, develop treatment goals, and review progress/barriers towards obtaining their goals towards self-sufficiency. For the purpose of this contract, VA discharge meetings do not count towards the weekly structured individual case management requirements. It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the contractor in any way or the responsibility for the daily care and treatment of the Veteran.   The contractor will assist the residents in obtaining community resources and assistance such as, but not limited to, and as appropriate: applying for social service benefits, applying for VA benefits, income assistance and financial planning, employment services, housing resources, religious/spiritual services and access to social/recreational opportunities.  The contractor case manager will assist Veteran with referrals to and follow up on all potential financial resources the Veteran may be eligible for (e.g. SSI, SSDI, Food Stamps, NSC pension, SC compensation, etc.).  Case Managers will document all structured activities that support Veteran in developing a short and long term plan to understand and address their current financial situation and how to improve it. Financial planning efforts may be accomplished in group but preferably through one on one case management services. The contractor must also promote community interaction, as demonstrated by scheduled activities or by information about resident involvement with community activities, volunteers, and local consumer activities.  Case managers will document all structured activities that support Veteran in applying for employment as appropriate based on needs of Veteran as identified in the assessment. Contractor will provide proper documentation verifying services and case management efforts provided to the resident by all team members including, but not limited to housing, benefit and employment specialists, and program management staff. There will be an expectation that notes are written professionally in a format that utilizes the clear settings of goals and documents progress towards those goals (e.g. SNAP, SOAP, DAP or SMART notes).  
Professional Counseling:  The contractor will provide professional counseling, including counseling on self-care skills, adaptive coping skills, and as appropriate, vocational rehabilitation counseling, in collaboration with VA programs and community resources.  In addition, special attention will be made to address High Suicide Risk (HSR) Veterans as identified by the VA Liaison, VA Mental Health Staff and/or the contractor s Case Manager. On a weekly basis the contracted case manager will be required to update the VA Liaison on Veteran progress and/or safety concerns for HSR Veterans. Contracted case manager will review the HSR Safety Plans with the Veteran on a bi-weekly basis. HSR Safety plan reviews and a copy of the Veteran s Safety Plan will be documented in the chart. If a veteran is deemed to be at risk of self-harm or risk of harm to others then contracted staff will immediately contact 911 or mobile crisis as well as notify VA liaison.  All Veterans will be referred for VA Primary Care and Contractors will support Veterans in making initial and subsequent appointments. Particular efforts to access care will be made for Veterans who are identified by VA Liaison to be highly acute.  Efforts will be documented in the Veterans ITP and reviewed by the VA Liaison at least monthly. 
Community Outreach: The contractor will participate with Delaware Homeless Planning Council to outreach currently homeless veterans who live in the streets, cars, parks and abandoned buildings.    
Permanent Housing Search: Programs are required to provide Veterans with direct and ongoing assistance in achieving permanent housing.  As a primary goal of the HCHV program, plans for Veterans  transition to permanent housing placements must be clearly reflected in each ITP and in weekly case management notes. As part of this plan, Veterans  housing history and needs must be assessed through a formal and thorough Housing Assessment completed within 72 business hours of program admission. Housing Assessments must identify Veterans  housing history, strengths (i.e. positive prior rental history), and barriers (i.e. Unlawful Detainers).  Should Veteran refuse to engage with program staff regarding plans for permanent housing transition, motivational interviewing and other therapeutic techniques will be used to address Veteran ambivalence. All efforts to engage Veteran regarding housing plans, options, and resources shall be clearly documented and include any therapeutic techniques utilized. Contractor staff must provide direct assistance to Veterans in developing permanent housing plans and accessing appropriate housing resources. These services shall be provided weekly through one to one case management. Examples of direct assistance include: 1) assistance obtaining and reviewing Veteran s free credit report, identifying housing strengths and/or barriers associated with current credit status; 2) Creating a Tenant Portfolio with Veteran that contains all relevant documents required in the rental process, including a completed sample rental application for Veteran, income verification documents, identification, applicable subsidies, etc.; 3) Reviewing affordable housing rental options and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) program offerings, and assisting Veterans with making appropriate rental inquiries and submitting completed rental applications; 4) Conducting regular and individualized housing advocacy efforts, including transportation, assistance scheduling, meeting, and communicating with property managers and landlords, and engage in troubleshooting where rental barriers or denials occur in the housing search process 5) exploring housing option in low-rent areas. All housing efforts by Contractor shall be documented clearly and presented to VA Liaison upon request. Mere communication with Veterans regarding housing, without subsequent Contractor staff action and follow-up, shall not on its own meet the above requirements. Veterans with Sex Offender status will have increased focus on discharge to stable or permanent housing placements as evidenced in ITP.
Recovery: Support for an alcohol/drug abuse-free lifestyle provided in an environment conducive to social interaction and the fullest development of the resident s rehabilitative potential. Assistance to gain and to apply knowledge of the recovery process in an environment supportive of recovery models including a focus on Harm Reduction rather than strict abstinence and supportive of a Housing First approach. Pursuant to these principles, drug testing may not be used to admit, discharge or discipline a Veteran but may be used as a clinical intervention to modify behavior. 
Discharge Planning: Securing permanent housing will be the primary discharge goal for every Veteran. All Veterans must have a discharge plan within one week of admission. Veterans must maintain a minimum of two appropriate housing placement applications until permanent housing is obtained. Contractor must provide computer and telephone access for Veterans to assist with discharge planning and case management needs. Case Managers will provide assistance with discharge planning for every Veteran and report all discharges via email within 24 business hours using a secured process (e.g. HOMES ID number).  HOMES exit form is required for discharging a Veteran from any HCHV program via fax within 24 business hours from known discharge.

<a href="mailto:sandra.fisher3@va.gov">sandra.fisher3@va.gov</a>
<DESC>VA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) for design of Upgrade Chiller Plant Switchgear , Project # 528A7-17-702. 
This is a 100% total service disabled veteran owned small business set aside. 
This project proposes to provide a second 15Kv feed to chiller plant, replace substations with energy efficient transformers , provide a single piece of double ended switchgear, and replace and right size the obsolete secondary electric equipment.  New substations will be relocated to an accessible climate controlled electric room to be created on this project.  Due to criticality of chiller plant, all single source of electrical failures in current chiller plant design will be removed in favor of full electrical redundancy. The switchgear location is on a mezzanine which is not climate controlled resulting in summer ambient temperatures well above 100 deg F which further reduced life span of the equipment. The mezzanine is  land locked  inside the chiller plant and there is no access for large pieces of equipment to come or go from that location.
Design services shall include, but are not be limited to, providing complete working drawings, specifications, and detailed cost estimates at every 35/65/95/100 % Review threshold.  Numerous and extensive meetings with various VA employees will be required,  in order to fully understand the functional needs, carefully review the space selected for this project, then prepare construction cost estimates, designs and construction contract documents as described herein.  Design services for asbestos sampling, testing and abatement, if found to be required at any time during the project shall be included but are not expected.  Design services shall also include infection control design in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (TJC) Environment of Care Standards.
The intent is for the design to occur during FY2017 and with construction in FY2017 or 2018.

<p>Description(s):<br />Added: TBD am Modified: October 24, 2016 Time TBD<br />United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) is announcing its inaugural Capabilities Information Exchange (CIE) with industry.</p>
<p>The CIE program is voluntary and open to all interested members of industry. Businesses that participate in the CIE will not receive any financial reimbursement for their participation from the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>On 15 December 2016, at the Fort Eustis Jacobs Conference Center and the TRADOC Headquarters building, ARCIC will conduct its inaugural CIE. During the CIE, the Government will brief industry on the Army's needs, initiatives, and concepts with the intent of integrating industry into capability development early and to assist in making better informed R&amp;D decisions. The CIE will focus on needed capabilities for future force development and inform the Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) strategy http://www.arcic.army.mil/. <br />The purpose of the CIE is to engage in early communication with industry on the Army's needs and concepts regarding future conflict(s). This early engagement will allow industry to better focus their independent research and development investment on efforts that best address the needs of the Warfighter.</p>
<p>CIEs will emphasize long-range planning to define future decision points that consider equipment age, degradation of overmatch, industrial base viability and closure of capability gaps in the near-term (FYs 16-20), mid-term (FYs 21-30), and long-term (FYs 31-50) time frames, while allowing for cost-informed decisions that balance force generation needs for Force 2025 and Beyond. The Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) and the Warfighters' Science and Technology Needs should be used when reviewing topics. See http://www.arcic.army.mil/, and http://www.arcic.army.mil/App_Documents/Army-Warfighters-ST-Needs-Bulletin.pdf.</p>
<p>The CIE will have two parts: An unclassified session from 8:00am to 12:00am which will be held at the Jacobs Conference Center, Building 647, Fort Eustis, VA and a classified session from 1:30pm to 3:00pm at TRADOC Headquarters Building 950, Fort Eustis, VA. The unclassified session will concentrate on: Army Capabilities / Warfighter S&amp;T Needs; Future Force Design efforts (operational and organizational); Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx); and the review of draft requirements documents.

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: The U.S. Census Bureau intends to award a noncompetitive contract to International Business Machines Corporation. The purpose of this procurement is to obtain dissemination and maintenance services to the Census Bureau through American Fact Finder Dissemination Operations.
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The United States (U.S.) Census Bureau is a bureau of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) and is one of several principal federal agencies that provide statistical services. The Census Bureau is charged with providing ongoing measures of the U.S. population, housing, and economy. The Census Bureau, which supports the economic and political foundations of the U.S., provides a critical service to the nation. Therefore, reliable collection, preparation, tabulation and dissemination of demographic and economic statistics are vital to the Census Bureau's overall mission and strategic goals and objectives. <br />The Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS) Program is the primary provider of dissemination services via the American Fact Finder (AFF) website for the Census Bureau. Dissemination services refer to the activities related to the internal staging and release of approved statistics for posting on the Internet. The DADS Program currently provides dissemination services for the Decennial Census, annual Economic Surveys, the annual release of the American Community Survey (ACS), the annual release of the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), the annual release of the Population Estimates, , and the Census of Governments (COG) and annual Government Surveys.<br />The mission of the DADS Program has been to prepare, tabulate, and disseminate data and data products that are complete, accurate, and formatted properly, delivered on time and within budget. This broad mission has been largely achieved; the tabulation system has been archived and the DADS Program is in the process of transitioning AFF technology solutions, business knowledge and assets to the Enterprise Dissemination Initiative (EDI). While that process completes and the new dissemination system continues to be built, dissemination activities will continue on AFF [factfinder.census.gov] to avoid interruptions in service.<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS:<br />The current contract for the operation and maintenance of AFF ends December 31, 2016. The development of a new enterprise dissemination tool is in process at this time to replace multiple Census dissemination systems including the legacy AFF system. However, the new tool will not be ready when the current DADS II contract ends. <br />This new contract will be a vehicle for the Census Bureau to continue uninterrupted on-time delivery of dissemination services through the AFF legacy on-line tool. The AFF system will continue to operate without interruption of dissemination services to release new data and provide public access to the historical data. Through this contact the contractor shall ensure services continue without disruption while Government and Contract staff contributes to the asset and technology transition for the development of the new Enterprise Dissemination Initiative (EDI IT - Platform). The services provided in this contract vehicle include infrastructure and security, program management, and system maintenance of high or urgent defects. <br />A contract transition period will not be available. The contractor must be immediately familiar with the established Census Bureau business processes, knowledge and understanding of the different components of the dissemination processing environments and review cycles to ensure that there are no delays in the release of products and the quality of data released are not compromised. <br />The AFF is the primary on-line dissemination tool for historical and current data releases for the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the Economic Census and other annual survey results, such as the County Business Patterns, ZIP Code Business Patterns, as well as the annual release of the Population Estimates data. American FactFinder usage comprises 13% of the overall census.gov traffic and serves a large, varied user base with the delivery of vital demographic and economic statistics. American FactFinder contains, over 80,000 tables, over 100 data sets in English with a large subset in Spanish. Economic Census data cover 99% of the economic activity of the American economy; Demographic Census data provide detail statistics for over 11 million blocks; the American Community Survey data provide annual detailed social, economic and housing characteristics. <br />The key objectives of the AFF - DO contract are to: <br />a. Maintain the AFF legacy dissemination services without interruption during the replacement platform development. <br />b. Minimize the change to processes and procedures on the legacy system contract due to reduced Government staff and resources. <br />c. Provide risk mitigation for both the schedule and delivery of the replacement platform for critical, high value assets and almost 80 additional data releases already scheduled. The high value data assets are : <br />i. 2016 and 2017 American Community Survey; <br />ii. the FY18 End to End Test for the 2020 Census; <br />iii. the 2017 Economic Census; and <br />iv. the 2020 Decennial Census.<br />d. Transfer, share and incorporate both technical and business process knowledge from the legacy system solution team to the replacement EDI IT-Platform team.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The government anticipates the services will be obtained through a firm fixed price and time-and-materials contract for a total duration of 24 months (12-month base and 12-month optional period).</p>
<p>Place of Performance: <br />U.S. Census Bureau<br />4600 Silver Hill Road <br />Suitland MD, 20746<br /><br />Capability Statement must include:<br />All interested contractors must demonstrate within their capability statement their experiences with the following unique qualifications and how they would be able to ensure a seamless transition of the project requirements:<br />a. Technical Expertise: The contractor must demonstrate unique knowledge of the American FactFinder implementation and technical solutions as they relate to the internal dissemination business operations processing and the public facing AFF on-line tool. Both the AFF technology solutions and business process knowledge of data product release cycles/product content and structure will be utilized, adapted and integrated into the replacement EDI-IT Platform. The contractor must also have deep knowledge and experience in the following areas. <br />i. Understanding of current dissemination processes and methodologies<br />This refers to varied Bureau of Census data products and release cycles including: data products and content, business processing for Decennial Census, 2010 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Data File, American Community Survey, Economic Census, Population Estimates, Annual Survey of Manufacturing, Business Patterns Data (County Business Patterns &amp; ZIP Code Business Patterns), Non - Employer statistics, American Housing Survey, SAIPE and SAIHIE Survey Data, and the Public Sector Data (formerly the Census of Governments).<br />ii. Standardized Data and Metadata facilitate automated data processing<br />American Factfinder utilizes a standard data and metadata model that allows for automated processing of both demographic and economic data. This improved efficiency and lowers the costs of dissemination. This approach is being adopted for the replacement EDI-IT Platform. In addition, elements of the AFF data and metadata models will be incorporated into the EDI-IT Platform data/metadata models to ensure migration of historical assets to the replacement platform. <br />iii. Management of geographic data<br />Geographic spatial and non-spatial data/metadata and Census geography subject matter concepts: Includes delivery formats, processing and transformations required to support product presentation formats and navigation in the replacement platform. <br />iv. Indexing and tagging of objects for efficient searching<br />The AFF indexing approach entails tagging of all metadata, geography, NAIC codes, population groups, product types, tables and other dissemination object to facilitate searching. Detailed business rules, and ETL processes will be modelled on the AFF solution for the replacement platform. <br />b. Established Operational and Program Management Processes: In addition to utilizing the technical expertise, the Government wishes to maintain the approved existing processes as established, documented and practiced during the ending DADS II contract so as to minimize risk of service interruptions and during a time when the reduced Government staff are managing legacy operations while participating in the development of the new platform. Smooth operational, system and legacy contract governance during the transition of technologies and assets is essential to support the development of the replacement EDI-IT Platform. These established program and processes cover the following areas: <br />i. Established Program Management Office Procedures <br />Established Program Management Plan and related processes for Communication and Program Status, Risk Management, Change Management, Quality Assurance and Surveillance, Performance Metrics and overall Contract Management. <br />ii. Established Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): <br />Established SDLC practices and procedures utilizing tools already in place for scope approval, configuration management, code development and integration, testing, User Acceptance Testing, and deployment processes and procedures. <br />iii. Infrastructure and Security: <br />Stringent monitoring/patching practices and schedules to maintain the system risk profile within tolerance; technical refresh activities and updates to avoid end of life for both hardware and software will be conducted. <br />c. Mature Dissemination Operations: The contractor must support and deliver a mature business operations life cycle with multiple product release cycles through multiple environments. The contractor must maintain current processing and on time delivery of multiple product schedules. This process entails maintenance of the service level agreements for the data providers with no interruption in service in any part of the business process life-cycle including: <br />i. Successful, on-time processing of deliveries into lower and higher environments; <br />ii. Execution of product assurance testing; <br />iii. Management of approval and release of cleared data into pre-production and production environments, including the embargo environment, as required; <br />iv. On time delivery of business process life-cycle work products and deliverables; and<br />v. Quality assurance and review of data products through the product release life-cycle.<br /><br />A determination not to compete this proposed contract has been made Pursuant to 41 U.S. C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by 6.302-1, this requirement has been justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and FAR 6.304.

The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the prices CLIN 0001.<br /><br />(C) Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a Quote from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement or the Offeror has made an unrealistic Quote.<br /><br />(D) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement.

<DESC>See Attachment for full Broad Agency Announcement.<br /><br />The FHWA's Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty's research activities support program and policy objectives which help the FHWA address topics associated with comprehensive intermodal and multi-modal transportation planning, enhancement of community and social benefits of highway transportation, and improvements to the quality of the natural environment by reducing highway-related pollution and by protecting and enhancing ecosystems. In addition, research on the fair and prudent acquisition and management of real property is undertaken.
<p>This BAA for Transportation and Air Quality Near Road Cooperative Research evolved from recent experience with transportation and air quality research and practitioners in consideration of the current information needs and data gaps. A similar effort was undertaken by FHWA in 2009 related to the application of the latest modeling techniques and methodologies. Results of that effort proved fruitful in providing enhanced mechanisms to estimate emissions and expedited delivery of transportation projects. Based on the latest information at research conferences, current data gaps and research needs for highway projects related to air quality fall predominantly at the project-level. Addressing these needs will again aid in characterizing the potential for environmental/air quality impacts for projects in anticipation of moving a project forward in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to IHS through this contract.</p>

<p>No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE.

Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

A technical quotation containing sufficient information to demonstrate the contractor's understanding and ability to meet the Government's requirement, providing concise and detailed discussion as necessary of its intended approach for fulfilling the requirements defined in the SOW. The contractor may include any other information that it deems necessary. </a></p>
<p>2. A firm fixed-price <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOB Destination</span> quotation for the chemicals set forth in SOW Attachment 1 - Chemicals inclusive of the associated price of certificates of purity, MSDS, and shipping. To facilitate Government evaluation of quotes, CONTRACTOR'S SHALL POPULATE THE "UNIT PRICE" AND THE "TOTAL PRICE" COLUMNS OF THE SOW ATTACHMENT "CHEMICAL LIST" for the quotation to be considered responsive.</p>
<p>3. If the contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:" [The contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)]. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in its quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order.</p>
<p>4. The DUNS number for the contractor's active System for Award Management (SAM) registration. Contractors must have an active registration at <a href="http://www.sam.gov">www.sam.gov</a> to receive an award unless an exception applies.

<p>5. A completed version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue). The clauses within that attachment will be incorporated into the award document.</p>
<p>All questions regarding this notice must be submitted via e-mail to <a href="mailto:dennis.bailey@nist.gov">dennis.bailey@nist.gov</a> by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1:00 p.m. EST&nbsp;November 2, 2016</span>. Questions submitted after this date may not be addressed by the Government prior to the quotation submission deadline. If the contractor identifies any required chemical that is not commercially available in the requested quantities (or at all, i.e., manufacturing has discontinued), contractors are encouraged to notify the Government of this limitation of availability when submitting questions in response to this solicitation so that the Government may amend the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this procurement <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS NOT</span> being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).</strong>&nbsp; If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</strong></p>
<p>NIST will award a purchase order to the contractor who submits the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lowest priced, technically acceptable</span> quote that is responsive to all aspects of this RFQ.</strong> "Technically Acceptable" means that the quote meets the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability at the level of "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," and 2) Price. Each evaluation factor is defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Technical Capability:<br /></strong>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information submitted in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the contractor has demonstrated that the offered product(s) meet or exceed the requirements of the Statement of Work and its Chemicals List attachment. Contractors do not need to provide a quotation for 100% of the chemicals on the Chemicals List. To be considered technically acceptable, the contractor must provide a quotation for at least 85% of the listed chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <br />The <strong><em>evaluated price</em></strong> will be the total overall price, inclusive ONLY of the chemicals quoted by ALL contractors responding to at least 85% of the required chemicals (recalling that such price shall include the costs associated with certificates of purity, MSDS, and shipping). In other words, amongst technically acceptable (i.e., &gt; 85% fulfillment) quotations compliant with the solicitation requirements, only the quoted chemicals listed that all other technically acceptable quotations have in common will be used as a basis for price evaluation. However, the <em><strong>awarded price</strong></em> will be the total price of all chemicals (not just those in common) quoted by the contractor whose quotation is determined to be the lowest priced, technically acceptable solution.</p>

The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&shy;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) is currently accepting proposals to develop, design, and implement an Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS). The PRC desires an EDRMS which is compatible with DOD 5015.2 Standard (current version). The EDRMS is required to ensure compliance with Section 3101 of Title 44 U.S.C., and the official Joint Memorandum (M-12-18) from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and National Archive and Records Administration (NARA). </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The proposed EDRMS solution must use Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software, which will require minimum customization to fit the PRC's needs. It must also integrate with existing PRC systems such as email, intranet and extranet. The EDRMS will serve as an integrated enterprise document and a record management environment where all electronic records repositories share an integrated common interface to manage the entire records life-cycle from creation to disposition - including the electronic transfer of the PRC's records to NARA.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The purpose of this RFP is to obtain the best technical expertise and consulting services to facilitate the PRC's transition to an electronic document management system with workflow, revision control, and retention policy enforcement while ensuring full compliance with applicable government policies for security and access control. The winning solution will be selected through an extensive evaluation based on the criteria listed herein. The PRC will select the vendor who offers the best value and whose approach best represents the direction PRC wishes to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">A successful records management system ensures that information is available in an organized and efficient manner.

At that time, paper records are prepared, boxed with the appropriate documentation and markings, and stored on-site for long-term retention.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Electronic documents and data exist on file shares throughout the PRC. The PRC has developed a strategy and processes to inventory most of the file shares, identify and classify the data according to record schedules, and update the record schedules.

This strategy shall include policies, procedures, directives, governance, and reporting; staffing, record schedule and files plan update and maintenance, taxonomy and metadata update and maintenance; and records training, records communications plan, documentation and other required functions of records management staff/section.<br /><br /></span></p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER<br />HSCG40-17-Q-19001 <br />87' PATROL BOAT PROPULSION SHAFTS REPAIR AND MANUFACTURE <br />________________________________________<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date; the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.</p>

<p>Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will receive a Neutral Rating for past performance. The offeror will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance. Relevant Past Performance history will be rated higher than Neutral past performance.</p>
<p>FACTOR #3 COST/PRICE:<br />The price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quote. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Vendors are required to provide prices for all items/CLINs for the Base and all Option years. All prices on CLINs (Attachment I Schedule of Supplies and Prices) shall be firm fixed-price with the cost of packaging, marking and bar-coding along with shipping, F.O.B. Destination, included in the cost of the parts. The total of all CLINs will be added together to arrive at an aggregate total. (Note that the Extended Price column and Extended Total should automatically calculate and populate if entering the amounts directly into the spreadsheets.)</p>
<p>Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with its offer.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, the initial quotation should contain the vendor's best terms from a cost standpoint and all other factors being considered. The Government reserves the right to seek information clarifying any element of a quotation prior to award without discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines it necessary.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)<br />BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The Government will award one (1) Requirements contract to the Offeror's determined to provide the best value on the basis of all non-price and price related factors. The evaluation of quotes submitted in response to this solicitation shall be conducted on a source selection basis utilizing a "tradeoff" process to obtain the best value to the Government. As part of the tradeoff determination, the relative strengths, weaknesses and risks of each quote shall be considered in selecting the offer that is most advantageous and represents the best overall value to the Government. A trade off will be made between cost and non-cost factors permitting acceptance of other than the lowest price offer. In determining best value, the total cost/price, including options and other cost factors is considered to be less important than technical merit. Past performance is considered to be of equal importance to technical merit. However, the closer the merits of the combination of the Technical Plan and Past Performance are to one another, the greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination. In the event that two or more technical plan and past performance reports are determined equivalent, award may be made to the lower price quote provided the price is reasonable and realistic.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award contracts based on the initial offers and without discussions, although clarifications (as defined in FAR 15.306(a)) may be needed. If discussions are held, the Government will conduct discussions with all firms that have been found to be responsive and request final proposal revisions.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in any target price, or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the total final price as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken.

RATING  DEFINITION
Acceptable Quote clearly meets capability requirements.  
Unacceptable Quote clearly fails to meet capability requirements. 
CRITIERIA 2:  Price Approach
Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis in the Price and Schedule section. The Government will evaluate offers by adding the total of all line item prices.  Pricing may be compared against the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) or against the average mean of the offers received and may be used to set a competitive range if discussions are deemed necessary. 
Failure to submit all required documentation as required may result in your submission being found to be technically unacceptable.
c). The provision at Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (OCT 2014).
BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government will make award to one (1) vendor whose quotation offers an integrated approach for meeting the requirements of the SOW. The Government will evaluate all quotes on a Lowest-Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) basis.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Deputy Country Representative - Honduras - is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative in Honduras.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAID/OTI's Honduras country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to support the OTI Country Representative with managing an implementing partner and may be called upon to represent OTI's program to local partners, senior-level U.S. government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>Aligned with USG policy priorities, USAID/OTI's program supports greater civic engagement and public awareness through media programming and related outreach activities. The USAID/OTI program coordinates with, and complements, other USAID and Department of State assistance efforts, as well as those of other donors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices, U.S. Government agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor and train OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;<br /> <br />&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the FSN staff, including program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other related duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Honduras, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Honduras, the work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

 An Offeror that does not leave the premises may be requested to leave or be escorted off the premises.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

Current contract information:

Contract #: N00244-16-P-0020
Contractor: Merrimac Petroleum, Inc., Long Beach, CA
Contract Expiration: 2NOV2016

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 and FAR 13 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
  The solicitation number is N00244-16-T-0301 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-91 effective 30 September 2016.  Solicitation is 100% Small Business Set-Aside and the associated NAICS code is 325120 and small business size standard is 1,000.  Requirement as follows:
CLIN 0001 QTY 1 Lot Bulk Propane and Delivery Total Estimated Quantity of 42,400 gallons delivered at 6 Naval facilities located in California â€“ see attached Requirements Description/Delivery Schedule.
 Delivery/Period of Performance:  1 year POP from contract award date; FOB Destination â€“ various locations â€“ see attachment
The FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the provision.
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
 (i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement;
(ii) Past performance; and
(iii) Price
Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. 
Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  A â€œwill complyâ€ statement without accompanying technical specifications and/or drawings of product being offered is automatic failure under this factor.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and may be removed from further competition.
  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers that are rated acceptable in Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), and (iii).  Contract will be awarded to the offeror who is found acceptable in Factors (i) and (ii) and is the lowest price offer.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  Technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement.  This factor has following sub-factors as follows:

1)	Licensed propane dealer in California
2)	Delivery Schedule to include statement of being able to deliver propane within 24 hours of order during emergency conditions; 

Quote shall include a statement confirming compliance with subfactors 1) and 2) above to receive rating of acceptable in Factor (i).
  It is in the discretion of the Contracting Officer to decide whether to accept as acceptable proposed later delivery schedule â€“ i.e. more than 24 hours during emergencies if only one quote is received.

(c)  Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. Offers that lack relevant past performance history, will receive a neutral rating under this factor.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  Neutral rating will be rated as acceptable.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.  Satisfactory rating will be rated as acceptable.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance.  Unsatisfactory rating will be rated unacceptable.
(d) Price quote.  
(1) Bulk propane pricing shall include the following:
- Pricing summary using Table 1 format from attachment; 
- Offeror shall include the pricing formula/methodology used in its quoted price to include the propane index (or market indicator), markup, and current IFF rate used - see below.
(2) Total Price will be the sum of all prices under â€œExtended Priceâ€ column and will be the evaluated price.
(3) The Pricing formula will be incorporated in the resulting contract and shall be used as basis for requesting for Economic Price Adjustment (see FAR 52.216-2).
(4) A single-award Fixed Price contract with Economic Price Adjustment will be awarded to the quote that received ratings of acceptable in Factors (i) and (ii) and is the lowest evaluated price.
(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
 Before the offerâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 Alt 1, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.  Other applicable FAR clauses and provisions:

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought notice in regards to the Nett Warrior&nbsp;Assured Global Positioning System (A-GPS). This is NOT a Request for Proposal and no award will be made as a result of this request. All interested companies are encouraged to respond to this notice. <br /><br />The Army Contracting Command is issuing this RFI on behalf of Nett Warrior. The Government is not imposing a page limit to the response; however, to assure each response receives proper consideration it is recommended that the size should not exceed 15 pages (not including supporting documentation). If supporting documentation is necessary, please indicate which portions are relevant to this RFI.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The Nett Warrior (NW) system is comprised of a commercial off the shelf End User Device (EUD) based on smart phone technology, an Army-approved tactical radio as the digital data transport mechanism, Radio Power Adapter, Radio Data Adapter, and Centralized Power Source. All components are connected via Government manufactured cabling with quick disconnect connectors. Additional devices can be integrated into the NW base configuration, using the NW hub, USB protocol and the NW-defined interconnect cables.</p>
<p>This RFI serves as a market survey for potential solutions for a Soldier Wearable Assured Global Positioning System (A-GPS). The desired solution will act as a stop-gap measure until M-Code GPS development is complete. The desired solution would allow for connection to Army-approved tactical radios, USB host devices and mount directly to the body armor system leveraging the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLL-E) features.</p>
<p>The intent of this survey, which includes a questionnaire, is to understand potential solutions, request innovative ideas, and serve as a basis for a set of technical requirements for the device. Respondents are requested to answer each question based upon the information and requirements presented in this RFI.</p>
<p><strong>The Assured Global Positioning System (A-GPS) should consider the following technical requirements:</strong></p>
<p>1. The A-GPS shall support L1/L2 (Threshold) and M-Code (Objective) signals.<br />2. The A-GPS shall support Anti-Spoofing.<br />3. The A-GPS shall support Anti-Jamming.<br />4. The A-GPS shall support Pseudolite signaling (Objective).<br />5. The A-GPS shall support Red and Black Over-the-Air (OTAR) Keying.<br />6.

The A-GPS shall be Plug and Play.</p>
<p><strong>Design: The size, weight, power, cost, and reliability and important factors</strong><br />1. Describe in detail your proposed solution for providing an Assured Global Positioning System which meets the requirements described in this RFI. Describe each solution (to include pictures and/or drawings) proposed and its effectiveness in meeting the desired requirements and capabilities.<br />2. Define the expected size, weight, reliability and conformance to operating environment requirements of your solution. Note: It is important that size and weight be minimized.<br />3. The proposed solution must be based on available components. In order to provide the proposed capabilities, describe what modifications, if any, are required for adaptation. <br />4. Specify any additional features/functionalities (not detailed in the RFI) that are recommended for inclusion in the product.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong><br />1. Provide an estimated unit cost for the proposed solution. The procurement quantities may range from 300 to 4,000 in the first year followed by approximately 2,500 units per year with a total quantity of approximately 12,000 units through 2021. Identify production quantity break points that achieve economy of scale.<br />2. Identify any licensing / royalty fees associated with your proposed solution. Are there any additional costs?</p>
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong><br />As currently envisioned, as part of a subsequent request for proposal (RFP) process, the Government may request vendors to submit a detailed electrical schematic and conceptual mechanical design. The planned effort may include a short developmental effort to finalize the design and qualify the components to technical requirements before production begins. Once the contract is awarded, 30 first article units would need to be delivered to the Government within three (3) months of contract award. Once a production decision is made, initial production quantities (few hundred) would be needed within three (3) months by the Government. Specify any concerns with meeting these types of milestones that impact the overall schedule. If any of these milestones cannot be met, suggest alternatives for completing them.</p>
<p><strong>Experience/Qualification:</strong><br />1. Describe your organization's qualifications and experience regarding supplying components similar to an Assured Global Positioning System. <br />2. Discuss your ability to maintain schedule (i.e. on time) and stay within budget, all while meeting the necessary requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Production Capability:</strong><br />What is the manufacturing capability and experience of your company or team to supply a product of this type with this production volume?</p>
<p><strong>Other:</strong><br />1. Are there any requirements listed in this RFI that seem unreasonable or difficult to meet?<br />2. What requirements / information would need to be added to a resultant Request for Proposal (RFP) to help develop an accurate proposal?<br />3. Any suggested NAICS code and rationale for this effort?</p>
<p>Upon Government review of all vendor submissions, there may be a need for further questions. If so, the Government will contact each vendor, on an individual one-on-one basis, and ask the follow-on questions as required.</p>
<p>Data submitted in response to this RFI may be utilized to develop and document a formal RFP. To prevent inadvertent disclosure in the RFP technical package, vendor responses shall clearly mark individual data elements that are considered proprietary in nature. The submitted responses and data will be reviewed by the NW technical team which consists of both Government and embedded support contractor personnel.</p>
<p>Responses and technical questions should be provided via electronic submission to Contract Specialist, Sherri Gattuso at sherri.a.gattuso2.ctr@mail.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, 23 November 2016. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.</p>
<p>This is a market survey requesting information only. The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. The U.S. Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future production efforts. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey.

<DESC>HSCGG1-17-B-PFA005 <br />ISSUE DATE: 28 OCTOBER&nbsp;2016
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to remove existing circuit breakers and remanufacture and re-install the circuit breakers for the Main Distribution Switchgear in Smith Hall.</p>
<p>The project scope includes all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, supervision and disposal required to remove, remanufacture and replace rack-out circuit breakers in the 480V Main Distribution Switchgear, at Smith Hall. The project consists of all work necessary to remove and remanufacture (15) FM-25 600A frame rack-out circuit breaker, (3) FP-50 1600A frame rack-out circuit breakers and (1) 4000A frame rack-out circuit breaker residing in the 4000A Main Distribution Switchgear for Smith Hall. The rack-out circuit breakers are dated around 1972 and are in need of maintenance. It has been noted that the circuit breakers won't trip when manually released and are not likely to charge the springs for breaker closing. Smith Hall is the science building at the USCG Academy. The electrical replacements will directly impact ongoing scientific experiments. Therefore, power outages are to be limited in duration during the replacement process. Replacement work is to take place during weekends or during after hour periods and must be completed prior to normal working hours (M-F: 0730-1600). The breakers shall be installed by licensed electricians, those qualified to perform power equipment replacement work and familiar with installing and operating draw-out circuit breakers.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Breaker installation shall take place during off-hours and weekends so as not to disturb class work, labs and research. Estimated period of performance is a total of 19 weeks (including submittal time, lead time and install time), and is based on removal and installation of 5 breakers per visit with an approximate lead time of 3 weeks for breaker refurnishing. All work shall be completed no later than 21 April 2017.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the procurement is between $150,000 and $250,000.00. Solicitation packages will be available on 28 October 2016. The&nbsp;date set for receipt of bids is scheduled for 29 November&nbsp;2016 at 2:00 pm. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210 Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors, with a small business size standard of $15 Million. This acquisition is issued pursuant to FAR Part 14 and is 100% Set-Aside for Small Business concerns. All relevant solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings may be accessed for download beginning on the date of issue at the following site: http://www.fbo.gov. To receive immediate notification of all changes posted electronically, vendors should click on "Register to Receive Notification". All vendors interested in teaming or subcontracting for this solicitation, should click on "Register as Interested Vendor". In order to view a list of interested vendors, interested parties should click on "View List of Interested Vendors".

JUSTIFICATION
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
                                          Office of Acquisition Operations
             Technology Acquisition Center
             23 Christopher Way
             Eatontown, NJ 07724
            
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for brand name AINS, Inc. FOIAXpress licenses and support services. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to provide continued licenses and support services for the brand name FOIAXpress.  The current licenses and support include 450 FOIAXpress Read-Write and 450 FOIAXpress Read-Only Licenses.  The ongoing support also includes maintenance, monthly reporting and training services.  In 2009, the VA acquired a license to use a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) product, known as the FOIAXpress with an ability to provide the requirements mandated by the amendments to the Freedom of Information Act.  The FOIAXpress system is web-based, in order to comply with Executive Order (EO) 13392 and the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National (O.P.E.N.) Government Act, which amend the FOIA to require VA to provide more customer-oriented service by improving the management and administration of its FOIA program.   

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  In 2009, the VA acquired a license to use a COTS product, known as the FOIAXpress System, with an ability to provide the requirements mandated by the amendments to the Freedom of Information Act.  The current effort with Sword and Shield Enterprise Services, Inc., under SEWP IV Contract NNG07DA21B, Order VA118-13-F-0018, is set to expire on November 2, 2016.  This 6-month effort will bridge the gap between the expiring effort and the planned competitive action currently in the planning stage.  VA requires continued support of the FOIAXpress solution to meet the Freedom of Information Act mandates.  VA requires the FOIAXpress solution be maintained in order to continue to provide for the availability of the 195,000+ records currently stored, as well as all additional records over the 6-month period of performance.  The 6-month effort will also keep VA on track for its Annual and Quarterly reporting due to Department of Justice (DOJ) by the December 5, 2016 and February 5, 2017 deadlines to meet the FOIA statute reporting requirements.  The existing FOAXpress solution is offered as a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription based solution, requiring an Authority to Operate (ATO) and is offered on a FedRAMP certified cloud environment.  FOIAXpress is the only electronic FOIA solution successfully provided via a commercial FedRAMP SaaS cloud to Federal agencies enterprise-wide.

Any other e-FOIA solution would require a fully functioning COTS product that is capable of meeting the needs of the FOIA service for accessing the existing 195,000+ FOIA records via web/intranet and responding to the numerous FOIA requests as mandated by law.  It is estimated that an alternate FOIA solution would take a minimum of three months to complete data migration from the existing FOIAXpress tool.  In addition, an alternate SaaS solution would require a VA ATO be obtained.  The ATO process is estimated to take at least six months depending on the complexity and nature of the environment and the process does not start until the environment is available.  The migration of data would not be able to take place until such time as an ATO is achieved, and therefore it is estimated that any other source would need a minimum of nine months to provide full functionality of the FOIA requirements needed by VA.

Additionally VA requires technical support for FOIAXpress, through an authorized reseller.  Only FOIAXpress, through an authorized reseller, can provide the necessary software upgrades and patches because of the propriety source code required to develop and implement software updates.  Since the software is proprietary, a legal restriction is placed on access to the software code that is required in order to develop upgrades and patches to the software.  Without this access it is impossible for another source to modify the software code as necessary to provide the required patches and upgrades.  No other source other than a FOIAXpress authorized reseller can provide the required maintenance support requirements described herein, such as assistance via phone and email, as well as all software upgrades and patches.   

Failure to renew the FOAIXpress software licenses and support services will result in VA being at risk of non-compliance with FOIA mandates, and unable to track and respond to FOIA requests as required by law.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section eight of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  It was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required brand name FOIAXpress software licenses and support services that hold current NASA SEWP V GWACs.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), notice of award of this action will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), this justification will be posted with the request for quotation on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website to notify all interested parties.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.  VA technical Subject Matter Experts regularly review industry trade publications and conduct internet research to ascertain if any other software is available to meet the requirements described herein.  VA is currently planning a competitive action that will provide for a long term e-FOIA solution for the agency.

8.  Market Research: Market research was conducted in October 2016 by releasing a Request for Information (RFI) on NASA SEWP, seeking offerors who could provide an e-FOIA solution.  Three responses were received by the closing date of the RFI.  PSI Technology a woman-owned small business, RedHawk IT Solutions, LLC a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and ThunderCat Technology an SDVOSB provided capability statements on October 12, 2016.  All three respondents advised that they could provide an e-FOIA solution, and each responded offering the FOIAXpress solution.  PSI, however, also responded with an alternate e-FOIA solution, called GovQA.  PSI proposed two implementation plans with detailed timelines; however, both proposed timelines for complete data migration and customer sign-off that were beyond the required start date of November 2, 2016.  As such, the Government s technical experts determined that the GovQA offering was not a viable solution as it would not meet the Government s requirements for a fully functioning e-FOIA solution with completed data migration by November 2, 2016.  Based on the market research efforts, the Government s technical experts have determined that only FOIAXpress software license and support services can meet all of VA s needs.

9.  Other Facts:  None.
