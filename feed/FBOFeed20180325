<DESC><p>This is a special notice seeking competition for Blanket Purchase Agreements. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for these requirements; pricing is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) / Price List.<br /><br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96. This procurement is subject to full and open competition. The North American Industrial Classification Standard 721110 applies to this solicitation; business size standard is $32.5m. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to award under a different NAICS, if the company would qualify as a small business under the solicited NAICS.<br /><br />The Minnesota Air National Guard, 148th Fighter Wing, has established several Blanket Purchase Agreements with local hotels, including Days Inn and Holiday Inn. A Blanket Purchase Agreement is an agreement between the government and a vendor that allows the 148FW to make "calls" against established terms via a government credit card (GPC). The 148FW is seeking to expand the potential pool of BPA holders. <br /><br />Any BPA will be valid for a period up to three (3) years, with potential for automatic re-issuance. All BPA calls are under the Oral Quote threshold and will be competed among BPA holders. Typically, at the start of any year, the 148FW distributes potential needs to all BPA holders. BPA holders then return pricing and availability for those dates. The 148FW selects the best value location or locations per date ranges. These calls are supplemented as needed.<br /><br />The following is needed:<br />- Price lists, availability, and maximum capacity numbers for the coming year (2019). Please include any information about the quality of hotel and location. Locations within a 5 mile radius of the Duluth International Airport will be given precedence, although all locations in a 50 mile radius will be considered.<br /><br />Please note that a BPA is not a contract.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia Office<span style="COLOR: blue"> </span>intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Hexagon US Federal. The proposed acquisition is to purchase ruggedized marine engineering systems hardware to support the establishment of the CG-69 enterprise Remote Monitoring (eRM) installation. It is necessary to procure the required hardware from Hexagon Us Federal in order to ensure a similar position of readiness for the affected systems/programs. Procurement from another source would cause the Government to incur duplicated costs related to the program, logistical and system management activities for the ICAS &amp; FRRDP programs. This action will result in a firm fixed-price (FFP) purchase order.</span></p>
