 SOLICITATION NUMBER: RFP# 263-04-018 
 ISSUANCE DATE: January 26, 2004
 CLOSING DATE/TIME: 4:30 pm Cairo time on March 1, 2004
 POSITION TITLE: Supervisory Commodity Management Officer/Division Chief
 MARKET VALUE:  GS-15 
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years with an option to renew for two years
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Cairo, Egypt. 
 SECURITY ACCESS: SECRET
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
 
I.	Introduction: 
             
Organizational Location of the Position:  The position requires residence in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.

USAID/Egypt Program:  USAID/Egypt manages the largest and one of the most diverse programs in USAID.  The program is highly visible and consequently attracts intense State Department interest, Embassy oversight, and Congressional scrutiny.  The Mission is currently restructuring its portfolio to accommodate a planned reduction in the program budget by one-half and the staff by two-thirds over the next seven years, and a new country strategy that is designed to support Egypt’s efforts to compete successfully in the global economy.

The incumbent will serve as the Chief of the Commodity Management Division in the Economic Growth Directorate.  The Commodity Management Division oversees the Private Sector Commodity Import Program, currently funded at $200 million per year, and scheduled to be reduced to $150 million over the next seven years.  
 

II.		Basic Functions


The incumbent serves as Director of the Division of Commodity Management, a component of the Economic Growth Office, the largest office in the Mission.  The Division of Commodity Management is the focal point within USAID/Egypt for all aspects of policy, administration, and operations of the Private Sector Commodity Import Program (PRCIP).  The PRCIP is statutorily maintained at the minimum level of $200 million annually, which corresponds to over 30% of the total program yearly obligations.  The thrust of the program is to support the private sector as Egypt’s primary engine of growth by expanding and deepening financial services, and by introducing new technologies.  In addition, the PRCIP supports mission objectives by means of special incentives for investment in Upper Egypt, and for exporting companies.  Through special promotions, the Division seeks to direct PRCIP funds into fields associated with other Mission objectives, such as pollution abatement and medicine.  The incumbent manages a staff of one deputy and 19 FSNs.  Program partners include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Egypt, 31 participating Egyptian banks, and 10 U.S. correspondent banks.  Program customers are the private sector importers that use the program.  With great sensitivity regarding USAID and USG goals and interests, the position demands an ability to deal effectively with all partners, customers, and others within a complex environment in accomplishing the goals of the division.



III.	Specific Duties and Responsibilities

c.	Manages an accounting staff and an Oracle based software system to track applications, approvals, issuance of financial documents, shipments, according to the participant bank and bilateral grant.  Generates reports showing type of commodity, origin by state, type of importer, etc.

d.	Manages a staff physically located in Alexandria accounting for the arrival of all USAID financed commodities including project commodities.  Participates with FM in supervising end use checks.

e.	Creates and maintains productive relationships with private Egyptian business people using the PRCIP and assisting U.S. suppliers and Egyptian importers to develop lasting trade links.

 Plans and engages in PRCIP program promotions, aimed at improving outreach, encouraging small and medium firms to participate in the program, and directing program resources to private sector importers who can use them to enhance the Mission’s strategic objectives.

2.  Advises mission on the interpretation of USAID commodity financing policies and procedures applicable to program procurement.  S/he works with the executive core team for Strategic Objective No. 1 to provide a continuous exchange of information on private sector developments to ensure maximum program impact with the available resources, and to work in step with economic reforms.

 3.  Advises the responsible Egyptian Government agency and other participants in the PRCIP, maintaining liaison with the Egyptian Government, with banks, and with private sector importing firms.  Negotiates and coordinates program and other agreements, in particular Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Circular No. 1, with the MFA, Egyptian private sector importers, and with Egyptian participating banks.

D.        STRATEGY AND CONTEXT
 
1.	     USAID/Yemen Interim Strategy, 2003-2006 

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for a newly established economic growth component:
Agency Objective: Broad-based Economic Growth and Agricultural Development Encouraged
Strategic Objective 279-007:  Increased Income Opportunities and Food Security in Selected Governorates
IR 7.1	Expanded Sustainable Production of Rural Economic Products for the Market and Home Consumption
IR 7.2	Expanded Markets for Rural Economic Products 
IR 7.3  Improved Framework for Economic Growth

2.	Context:  

Yemen is a crucial ally in the US-led war against terrorism. The capacity of Yemen to fulfill its role as an ally, however, is dependent upon its ability to decrease poverty and improve its overall economic performance.  According to a 1998 World Bank study, 18% of the Yemeni population live in absolute poverty, and 42% of the population are incapable of meeting their food and non-food requirements. Most of Yemen’s poor live in the countryside, who rely to a large degree on imported food, at subsidized prices.  Oil income, an important component to the national economy, is forecasted to decline steadily well into the future and will soon be a negligible source of foreign earnings. 
  
Agriculture:  Yemen is predominantly rural (75%) and the agricultural sector plays an important role in the Yemeni economy, not because of its contribution to GDP – though small and declining (24% of GDP in 1990 - 15% in 2000) – but because it provides employment to more than half (61%) of the labor force, livelihood to more than three-quarters of the population, and contributes about a third of total non-oil merchandize exports.     

Potential for growth in key sectors: The  World Bank believes that “rapid employment-generating economic growth (in Yemen) will only be possible if agriculture, fishing, tourism and manufacturing lead the way.  (However) Rising domestic security concerns, excessive and arbitrary regulations in infrastructure and services, weak legal and judicial systems, and difficulties in securing land titles hamper output expansion in most of these sectors”…(furthermore)…”reliance on domestic demand limits the prospects for faster and sustained GDP growth.  The impact of policy reforms (flexibility of the exchange rate and trade liberalization) made a significant impact on the competitiveness and good performance of exports.  Such gains need to be preserved and enhanced by deeper liberalization and improvement in trade-related infrastructure and services.”  

Trade:  Yemen is considered by the World Bank to be among the most open and trade liberalized countries in
the MENA region. Nonetheless, most of Yemen’s current non-oil exports remain primary, low value-added
products which also make economic growth more vulnerable to volatility in price and demand.  

Government Policy:  The ROYG would like to improve human capacity particularly among women, enhance
living standards, lower population growth rates, diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenue,
and raise per capita income. 

Structural Adjustment:  US$550 million in financing was extended to Yemen from 1995-2001 by the World Bank, the IMF and bilateral donors to support a ROYG economic reform process that resulted in a unified and liberalized the exchange regime, reduced subsidies on fuels and wheat, a restructured banking sector, simplified and liberalized trade, a reduced external debt burden, and improve monetary policy and control.  In an October 2002 meeting in Paris, donors pledged a US$2.3bn economic support package to support the Yemen poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) for economic development.  Key elements in phase two include: strengthening governance, civil service reform, decentralization, judicial reform, fiscal revenue and expenditure reform including tax system reform to broaden the tax base and enhance revenue collection and reductions in non-productive spending including diesel oil subsidies which cost 3% of GDP. 

3.	USAID Development Response

Although the primary concentration in SO-007 will be on the agriculture sector USAID will allocate some funds for technical assistance to the ROYG to investigate opportunities for expanded exports and trade and to support the ROYG Central Statistical Office to improve data for development planning.  The activities under SO 297-007 are illustrated within the three Intermediate Results in the Strategy: 

IR 7.1	Expanded Sustainable Production of Rural Economic Products for the Market and Home Consumption

USAID will assist GoY to improve crop and livestock specification and improve growing techniques; reduce wastage; improve access to inputs (e.g. seeds, feed); support community-based producers associations; expand access to electricity; assist businesses that support the agriculture sector; technical support to women food producers for consumption in the home through community-based outreach.            

IR 7.2	Expanded Markets for Rural Economic Products 
  
USAID will support improved access to infrastructure (e.g. electricity, roads) for agricultural related businesses;  improve product quality, processing and packaging; support private sector marketing co-ops; expanded access to credit; market research and development; marketing and advertising; expanding regional and international partnerships.          

IR 7.3  Improved Framework for Economic Growth 

USAID will assist Yemeni higher education and research institutions to support the private sector in agriculture and business; establish business information centers; technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture and other Ministries and to district and governorate agriculture and economic development offices; targeted research to identify opportunities to expand exports and increase investment in new businesses; technical assistance to assist the ROYG increase trade opportunities; technical assistance to ROYG at all national, governorate and district levels to collect and use agriculture and other commercial data for planning.

D.	STRATEGY AND CONTEXT

1.	The USAID Yemen Interim Strategy for 2003-2006

In May 2003, an interim strategy was approved for Yemen.  The interim strategy contains the following framework for the educational support component:
Agency Objective: Human Capacity Built through Education and Training
Strategic Objective 297-006:  Improved Basic Education, Especially for Women and Girls
IR 6.1:  Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
IR 6.2:  Increased Literacy and Numeracy Opportunities at the Community Level   
IR 6.3: Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   

2.	Context 

Limited levels of education and literacy are a human capital constraint to economic development in Yemen.  In the rural areas where three-fourths of Yemeni’s live, 68% of men and 94% of women have had no formal education at all or have failed to complete primary school. Most (91%) of ever-married rural women are illiterate and most do not compensate by getting information from either radio or television. 

Access:  Education attainment in Yemen is among the lowest in the world.  Although an estimated 2.6 million children are in primary school, about half (approximately 2.5 million) of the primary-school age children (age group between 6 and 11 years old) are not in school.  Gender disparity is pronounced.  In 2001 the Primary Education Net Enrollment Rate (NER) was 61.3% among boys compared to 41.1 % among girls.  According to the 1999 National Poverty Survey, only 45% of rural primary age children (age group between 6 and 11) were currently enrolled in formal schooling, while 71% of urban children were enrolled.  Rural female students are the most disadvantaged (30% enrolled), compared to the urban female students (71% enrolled).   Finally, the retention rate for female students is only 33 percent compared to 68 percent for male students.

Quality: To some extent the poor quality of primary education reflects the low qualification of teachers, especially in rural areas.  The 2000/01 Education Survey estimates that only 40 percent of teaching staff hold secondary school certificates or better, the balance (60% of teachers) have completed only basic education, with one or two years of additional training.  The primary school curriculum and textbooks have been updated recently but the majority of grade 4-6 students have difficulty relating what they have learned in the classroom to what they observe in their environment; explaining and interpreting the meaning of phenomena due to the lack experimentation in school; in mental calculations to resolve problems; and reading and interpreting tables and graphs; and most students have limited reading and writing skills.  Although in-service teacher training is being expanded, primary education still faces serious difficulties, including inadequate school buildings, shortage of teaching and learning materials, and weak community involvement and regional shortages of teachers, especially in rural areas.

Government of Yemen Policy:  

The Government  of Yemen (GOY) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) states that  education is a key driver for economic and social development, and sustainable human development.  Basic education is considered essential for rural development and the agricultural sector, and is fundamental to increase industrial productivity.  The teaching of girls is an important factor to improve maternal and infant health and nutrition, as well as to reduce fertility, and to bring about social change in women’s position in society.  Thus, the education strategy in Yemen focuses on four basic principles:  (i) improve the quality of education; (ii) improve the management of the sector and the orientation towards decentralization; (iii) give priority to basic education; and (iv) focus on girls’ education, with the aim of increasing the overall enrollment rate. 

3.	USAID Development Response

The following are illustrative activities in the education sector from the USAID Interim Strategy:
 
IR 6.1	Enhanced Access to Quality Primary Education in the Public Sector
The USAID program will construct, renovate and equip a limited number of elementary schools in partnership with community organizations with special attention to physical constraints to girls’ participation (e.g. separate latrines).   The majority of construction, rehabilitation and equipment will be supported by the USDA 416(b) local currency program.   To improve the quality of education, USAID will also train teachers (especially female teachers) and administrators with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry -based, teaching methods.  USAID will also explore opportunities to provide nutrition and other incentives to increase enrolment and retain children in school through other USDA programs (e.g. Food for Education).

IR 6.2	Increased Literacy and Numeracy  Opportunities at the Community Level 
With large numbers of children out of school (especially girls) and virtually all rural women uneducated and illiterate,  USAID education activities must reach out and provide life-experience-relevant, essential literacy and numeracy opportunities in rural communities.  USAID will increase education outreach to adults (especially women) and out-of-school youth in rural communities; radio/video distance-learning activities; organize parents’ and women’s education circles, community-based organizations and teacher/parent committees. 
 
IR 6.3	Improved Public Sector Environment for Education   
	USAID will develop and implement district and governorate education plans with community participation; fund education planning and program grants; promote new teaching approaches such as interactive and inquiry-based, learning; improve policies and regulations; include life-skills in the curriculum; develop policies and activities for out-of-school youth; provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and to district and governorate education offices to implement the ROYG decentralization objects and the ROYG Basic Education Strategy; provide technical assistance to ROYG at all levels to collect, use and share education data for planning and management; explore IT applications to support program objectives.

I.	Basic Functions of the Position 

The USPSC will serve as the Senior Educational Advisor to USAID and the U.S. Embassy as well as supervise and support the FSN Education Program Specialist in an education program that is anticipated to receive $8 - $12 million over the next three years.  In tandem with the senior program specialist, s/he will be expected to coordinate with senior level ROYG officials at the national and provincial levels, local education institutions, local and international non-governmental organizations, and other donors to achieve program objectives as defined in the Yemen Interim Strategy described above.  The incumbent will be supervising one FSN- Education Specialist.  
 
II. 	Specific Duties and Responsibilities

The Senior Education Advisor will be expected to, in order of priority:

1.	Serve as the Senior Advisor for the USAID/Yemen Education Program:

•	Develop strategies and programs for new activities.
•	Serves as a cognizant technical officer (CTO) for education programs in Yemen.

•	Prepare all requisite USAID documentation including semi-annual program reports, annual R4 reports, and scopes or statements of work and/or program descriptions. Incumbent will also prepare additional reports, as required, to brief the US Embassy and USAID on specific issues or situations impacting program success.

<LOCATION>Egypt USAID-Cairo
<ZIP>09839
<OFFADD>Agency for International Development, Overseas Missions, Egypt USAID-Cairo, Department of State Unit #64902, APO, AE, 09839
<SUBJECT>C -- USAID/Egypt Water & Wastewater Sector, Contract Modification
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-02-00038-00 with Camp Dresser & McKee International Inc. (CDM) which was executed on August 29, 2002 in the amount of $10,829,195 and expires on September 30, 2005.
Under this modification, CDM will continue to provide Engineering and Construction Management Consultant (E&CMC) services to the Secondary Cities Water and Wastewater Project in Egypt using the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures allowed under USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) Subpart 706.302-70(b) 5 (An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays).  

The purpose of CDM contract modification is twofold, first, to increase the Level of Effort (LOE) and, secondly, to increase the necessary respective funds to enable CDM to continue claims and limited construction management services.  CDM is actively engaged in managing a large and complicated claim filed against the Egyptian National Organization for Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage (NOPWASD), under the Aswan group of cities contract.  For over one year,  NOPWASD has engaged the law firm of Ober/Kaler, as a subcontractor to CDM, to represent them in an ongoing arbitration process.  Currently, Ober/Kaler is assisting NOPWASD in the arbitration process by issuing a response to the claim which will form their counter claim. It is envisaged that the services of Ober/Kaler will be continued under the proposed contract modification for the duration of the arbitration process which is expected to be completed by the January 2005. 
At present, CDM is providing CMC services for the current Host Country Contracts (HCC) of 1. ABB SUSA and Morganti Group, Inc. for Mansoura City, 2. Morrison Knudsen Int. Inc. /Contrack, JV for Aswan group of cities,  3.  Morganti Group, Inc. for Nuweiba, and, 4. Washington Int. Inc. /Contrack, JV for Luxor.  Construction work under all these Host Country Contracts, between the above mentioned contractors and NOPWASD, is either completed or substantially completed.  Therefore, most construction management work has been completed, except for the continuation of a substantial claims management task that will be included in the proposed contract modification discussed herein.  With respect to construction supervision, three contracts in Mansoura, Nuweiba and Aswan group of cities are 100% complete, and the defects liability certificates are being issued.  The contracted work under Luxor contract is 100% complete, with the taking over certificates for substantial completion issued and warranty period ongoing.  Operation, Maintenance and Training (OM&T) activities are ongoing in Luxor and will be finished soon.  The contracted work under the Morganti Group Inc., in Mansoura, is approximately 78% complete, and will be completed by August 2004.  OM&T activities in Mansoura have started and will be finished by June 2004. 
Other remaining construction management services will comprise the proposed supervision of $5 million additional work in Mansoura under the ongoing HCC between Morganti Group, Inc. and NOPWASD, as well as potential construction work valued at approximately $2 million using a separate contracting mechanism.  Work under the proposed contract modification will also include construction management for the proposed rehabilitation of a wastewater pump station in Luxor (designed by CDM) and the installation of a new force main pipe, with an estimated construction cost of $10 million.

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and exceptional capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. The government will consider all expressions of interest received within thirty days (30) after date of publication of this advertisement.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
