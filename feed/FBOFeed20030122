<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis to change the solicitation number from 02SI202021 to 03SI200018. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the construction of a permanent pumping system in Placer County. This project is located on the North Fork of the American River at the existing Auburn Dam construction site in Auburn, California. The project will be constructed in two phases. Phase I of the project consists of rough grading the de- watered river channel, a pump station, a wet-well and intake piping, a discharge pipeline, and access roads to the pump station and Auburn Ravine Tunnel Portal. The principal components of the work are as follows: Auburn PCWA Phase I Work. River Channel Rough Grading - The rough grading of river channel will consist of excavating approximately 400,000 cubic yards of alluvial material and approximately 85,000 cubic yards of rock along a 3/4 mile long section of dried river bed. Pump Station - The pump station will be constructed approximately 1500 feet west of the existing bypass tunnel portal. The pump station will be constructed on a developed bench within known rock formations to take advantage of this stable geologic zone. The pumps, motors, valves, and electrical gear will be housed in a two-story structure. The lower portion of the structure will be a flood-proofed basement consisting of reinforced concrete base slab and walls. The base slab wi11 serve as a mat foundation for the entire structure as well as the basement floor. The top of slab elevation for the basement floor is 550 feet. The pump discharge piping and valves will be contained in this basement area. The main floor will also be of concrete construction (on a steel frame support) with a top of floor elevation of 560 feet to be above river flood stages. The motors and electrical gear will be located on the main floor. The upper portion of the structure will be of CMU construction. The upper floor will be partially open (mezzanine) to allow crane access to the valves located in the lower level. The pump station will have seven pump bays each capable of producing 38 cfs depending on the equipment installed. The initial capacity of the pump station will be 100 cfs and the ultimate capacity will be 225 cfs. Wet Well/Intake Piping - Conveyance of water from the intake structure to the pump station will be via a combination of 96-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipe and a horseshoe-shaped tunnel constructed into the rock formation. The intake pipe/tunnel will be centered on and perpendicular to the main (long) axis of the pump station. At the end of the intake tunnel, an 18 feet wide horseshoe shaped-cavern will be constructed under the pumps such that the completed intake and cavern sections form a "tee" in plan view. Upon completion of the tunneling, the contractor will bore pilot holes (from the top) for each of the seven pump bays. The bores will then be reamed to the required diameter utilizing the "raised bore" method, whereby the reaming bit is pulled up from the bottom allowing the tailings to drop into the tunnel. The bored holes will be lined with a steel casing. Structural concrete walls required for hydraulic purposes will be formed and placed in the cavern to complete the wet well construction. A large access vault will be constructed near the portal of the inlet tunnel. Discharge Pipelines - The discharge pipelines for the project consist of approximately 160 feet of 6O-inch diameter steel pipeline and approximately 800 feet of 72-inch diameter steel pipeline from the pump station to the portal of the Auburn Ravine Tunnel. Pump Station Access Roads - Access to the pump station will utilize an existing road that was constructed as part of the Auburn Dam project. The existing road terminates near the portal of the Auburn Ravine Tunnel. The main access road to the pump station will connect to this existing road and will be constructed as an all-weather (asphalt paved) road approximately 20 feet in width. The total length of improved and new road is approximately 2800 feet. Access to the Auburn Ravine Tunnel will be a new road, 10 feet in width and approximately 900 feet in length, having gravel surface that will be constructed as a branch from the new main access road. The magnitude of this project is more than $10,000,000. Funds currently do not exist for this requirement. This notice is issued contingent upon the availability of funding. This is an unrestricted solicitation all offers from responsible concerns will be considered. FAR clause 52.219-4 "Notice of price evaluation preference for HUBZone small business concerns" applies. Solicitation 03SI200018 will be posted at http://www.ideasec.nbc.gov on or about February 7th, 2003. The solicitation and specification can be downloaded at the above site, with the drawings being mailed hardcopy. To request a copy of the drawings, which will be available when the solicitation is posted, or to be added to the bid list contact Dee Zurek at 916-978-5137, e-mail dzurek@mp.usbr.gov or fax (916) 978-5175. Your request should have the following: Solicitation Number and title, your company name address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address. All technical questions will be answered by calling the Mid-Pacific Region Construction Office (530) 934-7066. Please reference the solicitation number. The site visit is to be determined; and can also be ascertained by calling the Mid-Pacific Region Construction Office.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, RF Sensor Technology Division, Reference Sensors and Receiver Applications Branch (AFRL/SNRP ) solicits research proposals for the Real-Time Encoding Processing program. The purpose of this acquisition is to develop and evaluate advanced real time wide-band Electronic Support (ES) radio frequency (RF) receiver encoding/pre-processing/sorting concepts and techniques focused on space and high altitude platforms.  The concepts and techniques will be designed to handle the increasing digitization of the modern complex RF signal environment for applications in existing and future ES aerospace systems.  The concepts and techniques will stress low power, reconfigurability, modularity, and affordability using advanced digital technologies.  Modern complex signals and larger instantaneous coverage present the ES system with larger signal densities and data rates. Detection, deinterleaving and precision parameterization of the signal are significant technical barriers to development of receiver encoding/pre-processing/sorting concepts.  Payoff to the Air Force will be the development of reduced size, weight and power of RTEP technologies, which can be inserted into new space and high altitude platforms.  In addition, these technologies, where feasible, can be retrofitted into current deployed AF systems. Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

PARK DESCRIPTION:  Big Bend National Park encompasses more than 800,000 acres in southwest Texas.  Its southern boundary forms the international border between Mexico and the United States.  Big Bend National Park has national significance as the largest protected area of Chihuahuan Desert in the United States.  The park exhibits dramatic contrasts; its climate may be characterized as one of extremes.  Because of the range in altitude from approximately 1,800 feet along the river to 7,800 in the Chisos Mountains, a wide variety of ecosystems exist - from hot, dry, sparsely-vegetated desert to much cooler and moderate forest.  Big Bend National Park is located in one of the most sparsely populated areas of the country.  The nearest community with modern amenities is the city of Alpine, 100 miles northwest of park headquarters.  Visitation to the park has averaged 300,000 in recent years.  Visitor services, as well as administrative facilities and employee housing, is concentrated in 4 main developed areas within the park. TYPES OF PROJECTS: The primary types of projects will include, but are not limited to: A. Water supply, treatment, distribution, and storage systems; B. Wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal facilities; C. Wastewater reclamation and reuse; and  D. Water and wastewater pumping facilities. As an example of the size of projects for Parts A through D, above, the size will range from very small (less than 1,000 gallons per day capacity) to larger (up to 50,000 gallons per day capacity).  Complexity will range from that of groundwater wells with disinfection to complete treatment facilities for surface water sources, and from that of on-site septic tank/drainfield systems to wetlands, lagoons, alternative and/or advanced wastewater treatment processes, and conventional wastewater treatment facilities. Projects may also include, but are not limited to: E.  Rehabilitation and new construction of Visitor Centers, Administrative Facilities, Maintenance Facilities, Comfort Stations, Residences, Campgrounds, Utility Infrastructure, and other structures and facilities constructed at Big Bend National Park; F.

The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTON PRACTICES: The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.   Accordingly, the selected firm must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and membership in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. Implementing sustainable design and construction practices is the constant process of identifying and incorporating activities and actions during facility planning, design, construction, and operation to meet the following goals: a. Consume less energy and natural resources over the life of the facility; b.Ensure that resources such as water, air and land are as clean or cleaner at the end of use as at the beginning; c. Ensure that the viability, integrity and diversity of natural systems are protected, undiminished and maintained; d. Ensure that natural sound-scape and dark skies are undiminished; e. Use green technologies and products that have less negative impacts on human health and the environment; f. Reduce the material entering landfills; and g. Ensure compliance with all natural and cultural requirements.  EXECUTIVE ORDERS: In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  Executive Order 13101 - Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition," (September 14, 1998).

When responding to this announcement, firms should fully address their capability, capacity and qualifications with regard to each of the foregoing evaluation factors.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 19.10) and is therefore open to both small and large business concerns. Small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.   SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENT: In accordance with Public Law 97-507, the A/E Firm will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for this contract are that 15% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small business, 5% shall be placed with women-owned businesses, 5% shall be placed with small disadvantaged businesses,  3% shall be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and 2% shall be placed with HUBZone certified firms. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal; however, contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES: In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contact amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms wishing to be considered must submit Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255 and other Pertinent information submitted in support of the completed SF 254's and 255's should not exceed 15 pages.  SF 254's and 255's must also be submitted for subconsultants. Clearly, specifically, and concisely address the evaluation criteria when completing the forms. Offerors are requested to submit one original of their submittal. Other marketing information such as booklets, pamphlets and brochures is neither requested nor desired. Submittals must be received in the contracting office by no later than close of business 30 days after issuance of this request in order to be considered for selection. ** Note:  This is not a Request for Proposals. **

All deliveries will be inspected by the on-site COR/PI and either approved or rejected for non-compliance before unloading.  The COR shall direct the Contractor to correct any nonconforming deliverables and confirm such direction in writing to the Contractor, with copies going to the Contracting Officer.  Deliveries will be made during normal business hours, Monday - Friday between 8 a.m. - 4 p.m., and coordinated with the COR and EC Feeding Contractor.  Weekend deliveries will be permitted only with the approval of the COR and when coordinated with the EC Feeding Contractor.  Weigh tickets will be provided to the COR upon hay delivery.  The COR will use weigh tickets to verify the tonnage shipped prior to inspection and eventual acceptance of each shipment.  The Contractor will be reimbursed for the actual quantity of alfalfa hay shipped.  The hay shall be delivered, unloaded and stacked (small square bales) by the Contractor at the following location: Bureau of Land Management, Elm Creek Wild Horse & Burro Center, 505 100th Road, Elm Creek, NE 68836.  7) All hay shall be transported using standard commercial practices for the shipment of alfalfa hay, in vehicles compliant with local, State and Federal regulations concerning the transport of alfalfa hay.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) plans to issue an order on a sole source basis to Peter Howell, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose and objective of this requirement is to provide technical support for research involving the design, development, characterization, testing and application of polyelectrolyte multiplayer coatings in plastic microfluidic systems (also known as Lab-on-a-chip devices).  Polyelectrolyte coatings will be deposited in the microfluidic devices and specifically patterned using a direct write laser-etching procedure.   Coatings will be characterized in terms of thickness and stability over time.  Devices will be characterized in terms of their effect on modulation of microflow.  These devices will be applied to chemical separations based on affinity interactions with the polectrolytes or immobilized DNA or proteins.  The following tasks shall be performed; Task 1: Synthesis of new block copolymers that can be used with polyelectrolytes as coatings for microfluidic channels. Synthesize a variety of block copolymers that have a hydrophobic portion and a hydrophilic portion.  Characterize the copolymers using analytical techniques such as IR and NMR. Task 2: Deposit the block copolymers on polymer microfluidic channels. Test biocompatibility by evaluating the nonspecific adsorption of proteins.  Evaluate the stability of the block copolymer films as a coating for polymer microchannels.  Form polyelectrolytes multilayers using the block copolymers as one of the selected polyelectrolytes. Task 3: Test coated microchannels to determine effect on electroosmotic flow.  Test electoosmotic flow in plastic microchannels using caged fluorescent dye techniques.  Test effect of coatings on electroosmotic flow.  Determine if patterned polyelectrolyte coatings are stable over time.  Task 4:  Attempt to form stable polymersomes using block copolymers.  Attempt to form polymersomes by at least two different techniques: electro formation and film rehydration.  Characterized polymersomes using fluorescence microscopy in terms of size stability.  Dr. Howell is uniquely qualified because he has extensive experience in the development of polyelectrolyte mulitlayer coatings in microchannel systems.  His experience includes design, development, characterization, testing and application of polyelectrolyte multiplayers for use in analytical separations.  The period of performance shall be from the date of award to December 31, 2003.  The anticipated award date of the order is on or about 10 days from the date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to the requirement no later than the response date above.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For information, call the POC identified below.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Mark Ready, Buyer, Phone 405-739-4374, Fax 405-739-4452, Email Charles.Ready@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force has a requirement for Unscheduled Depot Level Maintenance (UDLM) and Structural Repair Kits in support of the C/KC-135 and B-52 weapon systems, and when necessary, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) aircraft.  UDLM requirements include, but are not limited to emergency repairs and other routine repairs, modifications, installations, or services, which are not otherwise available from other existing contracts, where original equipment manufacturer expertise is necessary or where lead time for a separate acquisition may not be feasible.  The UDLM contract may also be utilized when mission dictates that an aircraft must be returned to service within a minimally specified schedule period.  Structural repair kits would vary depending on aircraft needs and could include:  spars, ribs, longerons, other major structural components, fasteners (non-stock listed), wing body skins and unique stiffeners to major structural components.

This is a synopsis for a noncompetitive proposed contract action.  The proposed contract will be with The Boeing Company, Wichita, KS.  The contract will be for a term of five years, consisting of one basic year and four annual option years thereafter.  The reason for proposing a noncompetitive contract action is that Boeing is the only known source that comprehensively possesses the necessary data (including proprietary data), expertise, facilities and tooling, necessary to repair the weapon systems in the timeframes required.  This synopsis is issued for subcontracting opportunities and for the possibility of enabling future competition.  All interested parties may respond and all responsible offerors will be considered.  The proposed issue date for the solicitation is 14 Nov 02.  

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using part 12.

<DESC>The Air Force has a requirement for certain data, called ?Rights Guard? data, which is proprietary to The Boeing Company (Boeing).  This data involves the design of military derivatives of Boeing?s Model 707, 727, 737, and 747 commercial aircraft.  It comes in the forms of drawings, CD-ROMs, Mylars, Digital Electronic Media and other formats.  The Government needs access to this proprietary data in order to obtain competition from contractors to make replenishment spare parts for the Government?s military derivatives of the above stated Boeing commercial aircraft.  In order to obtain this data from Boeing, a contract is required, setting out the terms and conditions under which Boeing will agree to the Government?s use of this data for competitive procurement of replenishment spare parts for the above stated aircraft.  

This is a synopsis for a noncompetitive proposed contract action with The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA.  The term of the contract is ten years, consisting of one basic year and nine annual option years thereafter.  The reason for proposing a noncompetitive contract action is that Boeing is the sole owner of this proprietary ?Rights Guard? data.  This synopsis is issued for subcontracting opportunities and the possibility of enabling future competition.  All interested parties may respond.  All responsible and responsive offers will be considered.  The proposed issue date for the solicitation is 6 Feb 03.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR part 12.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement initially posted 19 Nov 02 under the auspices of market research is hereby modified to formally advertise Solicitation No. MDA412-03-R-0002 scheduled for electronic release on this website on or about 28 Feb 03.  The solicitation will seek offers under commercially negotiated best value source selection procedures in response to the Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Europe (DoDDS-E) Heidelberg School Maintenance Program 2003 contract initiative for the acquisition of comprehensive maintenance and custodial support services for over 100 facilities and accompanying grounds strategically located throughout the Heidelberg, Bavaria, Kaiserslautern, Mediterranean, and Isles districts.  Contract type will be a task order driven Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity arrangement manifesting a cost profile ranging from $280,000,000 to $340,000,000 with a guaranteed minimum amount to be disclosed at time of solicitation issuance.  Contract award is tentatively scheduled for 01 Jul 03 subsequently encompassing a base year, 4 one-year option periods, 1 three-year award term period, and a final two-year award term period aggregating to a maximum contract performance period of 10 years.  Immediately available for phase-in will be up to 26 facilities operated under jurisdictional authority of the Heidelberg district.  Remaining districts will be activated for phase-in on an optional basis at government discretion pending examination of award results and time frames necessary for appropriate transition from other contractual obligations.  It should be noted it is the government's express intent to award a single contract integrating both maintenance and custodial support services with proviso a multiple award scenario may be considered.  In the event multiple awards do materialize, the government will not award a contract at any level lower than an entire district.  Major evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be past performance weighted at 35%, management at 35%, and technical at 30%, the combination of all non-cost related factors being slightly more important than price.  This contract initiative represents a true performance-based services approach whereby in response to a solicitation generated statement of objectives tasks will be performed in accordance with a contractor-authored statement of work, other applicable contract terms and conditions, and performance metrics firmly established by industry standards.  At time of initial screening of proposals the government reserves the right to limit competition to the most highly competitive offerors from which award will ultimately be achieved via the conduct of oral presentations.  Concurrently, this will not preclude the contracting officer from awarding on initial offers without the conduct of discussions if doing so is deemed to be in the best interest of the government.  Level of competition for this procurement is unrestricted.  Once the solicitation is made available for download it will be the responsibility of competing offerors to monitor the website for release of applicable amendments or other related information.  All interested sources possessing the necessary resources and proven capability to perform a requirement of this magnitude are encouraged to submit an offer that will be considered.  FedBizOpps registrants interested in this acquisition are requested to email the below point of contact to ensure compilation of a complete and accurate competitor database.

Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government?s rights under the Inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government?s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.   

Deliverables. The contractor shall deliver the following information and data to the Government.  The contractor is responsible for any changes to deliverables required for Government acceptance.

Drawings and Associated Lists.  Drawings shall be in contractor format and provide all engineering and design disclosure information to support installation, preparation for use, calibration, operation, fault isolation, repair and maintenance of the test stand.  The information shall, at a minimum, consist of: test stand operational and maintenance space required, facility service hookup locations, test stand interior layout, wiring/piping schematics, troubleshooting trees, parts list and overall dimensions of the test stand. 
Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).   The NADEP will provide one of each type UUT (one (1) fuel heater assembly, one (1) fuel heater connector, and one (1) speed governor) to the contractor for correlation and to support acceptance testing (factory and final).  The contractor shall submit a request for these UUTs in writing (e-mail acceptable) to the Government at least 15 days in advance of when these UUTs are required.  Such request shall include a shipping address, contractor point of contact, and telephone number. The contractor shall return these UUTs to the Government in the same condition as provided.  The contractor shall not be responsible for delays due to nonavailability of these UUTs. 
Technical Manuals.   The contractor shall provide two (2) complete sets of technical manuals.  The manuals shall provide detailed instructions to operate, maintain, calibrate, troubleshoot and repair the test stand.  Repair manuals shall include an Illustrated Parts Breakdown and parts list.  Parts list shall provide information on vendor supply sources to include part number, nomenclature, manufacturer?s CAGE code (if applicable), manufacturer?s address and phone number. The product support data shall include, as a minimum, the following:
Test Stand Description. Shall include a digital color photograph of the test stand, physical and functional (purpose) description, and shall provide leading particulars such as facility services required, operating parameters, and safety features.
Preparation for Use and Storage.  Shall include packing, preservation, service connection, initial adjustment, calibration requirements, and flushing procedure.
Maintenance.  Shall include all operational checkouts, inspection, preventive maintenance, troubleshooting, service, repair and testing.  
Calibration Requirements.  A complete description of all calibration equipment, standards, tolerances and procedures that are required in order to initially adjust and calibrate the test stand, and the frequency of calibration required to maintain the test stand within specified limits of accuracy is required.

Acceptance Test Plan. An acceptance test plan, in contractor format, no later than 30 days prior to acceptance test, for Government approval is required. 
Acceptance Test Report.  Upon successful completion of acceptance testing, the contractor shall submit an acceptance test report no later than 30 days after successful completion of test. 

Technical capability of the proposed test stand to meet the Government requirements will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in the proposal.  Therefore, it is imperative that each offeror provides sufficient technical documentation, specifications, etc. in order for the Government to perform an adequate technical assessment.  Product sales literature such as bulletins and specification sheets typically do not provide sufficient information for an adequate assessment.  In addition, a statement that the proposed test stand will operate per the Government?s specification will not suffice without a description of how the proposed test stand capabilities, features, and general design will meet the Government?s design requirements as specified in this RFP.  

Due to the critical importance of the test stand to Depot operations, only contractors with strong past performance in design, manufacturing, and installation of test stands are encouraged to respond.  In addition, this requirement is time sensitive and all proposals should emphasize the ability of the contractor to rapidly design, manufacture, install, and acceptance test a new test stand within the shortest timeframe possible, thereby minimizing the potential for the NADEP to experience work stoppage in J52 engine production due to downtime during removal of the existing test stand and installation of the new test stand, or downtime as a result of maintenance or catastrophic failure of the existing test stand.  The Government requires delivery of the test stand to be made no later than one hundred forty (140) days after date of contract.  Installation shall follow immediately thereafter and be completed no later than one hundred seventy (170) days after date of contract.  Acceptance testing of the test stand and training of NADEP operation, maintenance and repair personnel shall follow after installation and be completed no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after date of contract.  The contractor shall deliver to:  UIC N65886, Naval Air Depot, Building 1449, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL 32212-0016.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination, FOB destination.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In making its award determination, the Government will first determine whether an offeror's proposal satisfies the Government's technical requirements as contained in this RFP.  If an offeror's proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  Once the technical acceptability determinations are completed, all offerors' proposals with a test stand determined to meet the Government's technical requirements will be evaluated considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:


Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training

Past Performance

Price

Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  Furthermore, time is of the essence and Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training, individually, is more important than either Past Performance or Price.  

Delivery, installation and acceptance testing of the new fuel heater test stand and the training of NADEP personnel to operate, maintain and repair the new test stand are critical to ensuring continued J52 engine production capability at the NADEP.  As such, proposals that contain an accelerated delivery schedule for the test stand with delivery sooner than the required one hundred forty (140) days after date of contract, installation sooner than the required one hundred seventy (170) days after date of contract, and acceptance testing and training of NADEP personnel sooner than the required one hundred eighty (180) days after date of contract will receive a more favorable evaluation under the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training factor.  

For the Past Performance factor, the offeror shall describe its past performance on similar or related contracts it has held within the last five (5) years which are similar to the requirements in this RFP or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant related or similar past performance. Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of this RFP. The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

1.  Contract Number(s),
2.  Name and phone number of a point of contact at the federal, state, local government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
3.  Dollar value of the contract,
4.  Detailed description of the work performed,
5.  Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor, and  
6.  The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action.

If an offeror's proposal is determined to be unacceptable in either the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training factor or the Past Performance factor, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.

<DESC>Questions and Answers regarding USAID RFP TRN-03-008 - Warehouse Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.

Question 1 - Port work in Dar Es Salaam may be slow.  Due to the amount of time it might take to offload a large bulk shipment - the unloading time would exceed the permitted 4 days given by the port in which storage at port is free.  Will we be covered in case of exceeding these 4 days? 

Answer 1 - The contractor shall be responsible for taking possession of cargo at the port at the end of the ship tackle, from a storage shed or container yard, or at the end of the bagging line.  Prior to cargo being placed in any of the above positions it is not available for pick up - port storage time and charges should not accrue.  If the cargo is available to the contractor in any of the above locations, USAID expects the contractor to take possession of the cargo within the free time available at the port.  Should port charges accrue due to the late pick up of cargo, the contractor shall be responsible for those charges.

Question 2 - Is there a minimum height requirement for storage of cargo "off the floor?"

Answer 2 - There is no specific minimum height requirement, but there shall be a pallet barrier between the cargo and the floor.

Question 3 - We are told by our local agent that duty free status for the cargo can only be arranged by USAID.  Will USAID arrange for the exemptions?  Will there be a local USAID presence?

Answer 3 - All Title II cargo is humanitarian assistance food aid cargo.  The contractor shall be responsible for submitting required documentation to local customs or other authorities for duty free import and re-export of this humanitarian assistance food aid cargo.  USAID will present necessary documentation to the contractor for the purpose of obtaining duty free importation of the cargo.  Standard custom service and documentation charges shall be paid by the contractor.  There will be U.S. government representation in Tanzania.

Question 4 - Are we required to be a U.S. licensed freight forward company to be awarded this contract?

Answer 4 - Yes.  You may establish a joint venture to meet this requirement.

Question 5 - Where can I find the Federal Acquisition Regulations referenced in the RFP?

Answer 5 - You may find the Federal Acquisition Regulations at WWW.ARNET.GOV

Question 6 - May the contractor use two or more warehouses to accommodate the USAID Title II cargo in Dar Es Salaam?

Answer 6 - Yes, the contractor may use up to four facilities or warehouses to accommodate the food aid cargo.  All facilities or warehouses shall be within 40 miles of the port area.

<DESC>Motor Vehicle Towing - Emergency/Beakdown and Shuttle Service.  The U. s. Postal Service is exploring the possibility of obtaining towing/shuttle service through a single point of contact (similar to AAA).  Shuttle service requries towing of multiple vehicles.  The USPS has a fleet of approximately 208,000 vehicles.  Long Life Vehicles (LLV) comprise about 174,000 vehicles.  Most are right hand drive.  The LLV is serviced at least twice per year.  Once a year the vehicle is shuttled from the field office to the Vehicle Maintenance Facility.  One way tows can be 250 miles.  Contractor's capable of providing this type service on a national basis are encouraged to submit their name, address to this office. A meeting to discuss ways and means may be held at some future date.

<SUBJECT>A--COMMERCIALIZATION OF HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contemplates holding a briefing on Monday, March 24, 2003 to discuss opportunities for the commercialization of its Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) in the analysis of machine health and acoustics.  This award-winning technology provides a nondestructive method for monitoring and diagnosing operational machine health condition enabling you to avoid catastrophic equipment failures.  Potential uses for the HHT in this application area include oscilloscope response to impulse propagation of sound through materials for analysis and identification, noise filtering to improve sound quality, and vibration analysis.  Interested parties may have an opportunity to license the HHT under these applications.  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   The HHT Technology Briefing will be held in Greenbelt, Maryland.  Registration and details regarding the specific location and agenda are provided at   http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/hht   .  Briefing participants will receive in-depth information regarding the technical capabilities of the HHT and have an opportunity to discuss the HHT technology with technical experts regarding the implementation of this technology to meet your unique requirements.  One-on-one sessions will be conducted on the day of the briefing.	All interested parties must submit their interest in attending the briefing, in writing, by Monday, March 17, 2003 to Ms. Lembo at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 504, Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771 or via fax at (301) 286-0301 or register through the website at	 http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/htt	 .  These submissions must include:  (1) attendee name, (2) company affiliation, (3) company address, (4) company business, (5) areas of company research, and (6) place of incorporation.  If you have any questions about this opportunity that you would like addressed during the briefing presentations, please forward your questions to the aforementioned individual to arrive by Monday, March 17, 2003. Background on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) developed this highly efficient, adaptive, user-friendly tool specifically for the analysis of nonlinear, non-stationary data--a difficult problem confronting many industries--as well as the analysis of linear and stationary signals.  NASAs Science and Technology Board recognized the HHT as one of the most important discoveries in applied mathematics in NASA history.  HHT has also won the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Excellence in Technology Transfer Award, NASA Space Act Award, R&D 100 Award and Government Executive Leadership Award, and its innovator has been elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering--the highest honor that can be bestowed to an engineer. Previous to HHT, there were no suitable methods to analyze nonlinear and non-stationary data.  Unfortunately, few energy-frequency data sets, from either natural phenomena or artificial sources, are truly linear or stationary.  Therefore, an algorithm was needed for these pervasive circumstances.  The state-of-the-art HHT provides previously unavailable analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary data as well as linear and stationary data enabling better results and labor savings. The HHT algorithms are coded in C and accurately analyze energy frequencies via a three-step process: Sifting: Based on the empirical mode decomposition method, HHT's sifting process generates a collection of simple mode functions (SMFs) for the complicated data, allowing instantaneous frequencies to be defined. Hilbert transformation: Performing a Hilbert spectral analysis on the SMFs converts the energy-based signals to frequency- and time-based signals. Spectral presentation: The results are presented within the context of the Hilbert spectra. The HHT shows more physical meaning and enables users to conduct more precise analysis of signal data than can be obtained from conventional Fourier-based methods.	Further, when used as a filter, provides sharper analysis than Fourier-based filters.  This proven technology has been used to analyze under-water acoustic signals and several other commercial applications exist.  This technology is part of NASAs Commercial Technology Program, which seeks to stimulate commercial use of NASA-developed technology.  All responsible sources may reply to Kim Lembo (301 286-8113, e-mail: klembo@pop500.gsfc.nasa.gov).  This synopsis should not be

<DESC>The Executive Office for Immigration Review (hereafter EOIR) in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is requesting market information for a litigation-support contractor to manage and administer the entire ROP certification service provided to Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) in the Civil Division of  DOJ and the Federal courts.  This is a request for information only!  No solicitation will be issued as a result of this request for information.  Please provide information on your GSA schedule, if applicable.  A comprehensive turnkey operation is required to include, but not limited to: (1) receiving, tracking and fulfilling all OIL requests for certified  Records of Proceedings (referred to as ROPs); (2) meeting all performance requirements set by internal and external customers; (3) establishing and maintaining effective liaison and coordination with OIL to plan for, adjust and respond to customer requests, priorities, concerns and process issues; and (4) inventorying and storage of all ROPs during and after the certification process for a temporary period of time; after the short-term storage, ROPs are returned, by commercial overnight service to the appropriate immigration court.

The contractor must have the capacity to:  receive requests for certified ROPs directly from OIL; enter certification requests into a case-tracking database; determine the location of the ROP in EOIR and make request to retrieve the ROP; generate and review a copy of the ROP that can be certified by a trained expert;  paginate the copy of the ROP to be certified; make multiple copies - up to five (5)  additional copies;  create a comprehensive, quick reference index of the certified ROP; certify the ROP, with a formal transmittal memorandum attesting to the same; deliver certified ROPs to OIL by special messenger; make special deliveries to OIL for priority requests; provide certified supplemental documents to OIL; serve as a liaison between EOIR and OIL for ROP certification; store and return ROPs during and after the certification process;
provide routine performance-based reports and program status briefings to EOIR; manage and administer OIL priorities; and;  implement technology tools to facilitate the timeliness, quality and efficiency of the entire certification process (e.g., document imaging systems, etc).  Additional Information on Certifying Immigration Records of Proceedings for the Board of Immigration Appeals Executive Office for Immigration Review
 Traditionally EOIR, has provided certified copies of its ROPs for litigation in Federal courts.  Since 1996, the clerk?s office for the Board of Immigration Appeals - a quasi-judicial appellate body within EOIR - has managed this ROP certification service. The primary internal customer of this certification service is the OIL.  The important external customers are the United States district and circuit courts throughout the country. 

When the caseload was manageable and much smaller than today, the entire certification process was assigned to one government employee and four contractors.  To respond quickly to a ten-fold  increase in certification requests,  EOIR recently increased the amount of on-site contractors from four to thirteen. Despite this effort, backlogs continue and critical Federal court due dates are not being met.  What?s needed is a more flexible, dynamic and innovative approach to provide certified ROPs to OIL and the Federal courts.  Outsourcing the certification function, at this time, will provide that approach and, in turn, allow government personnel to refocus upon the work of a traditional appellate clerk?s office, such as processing appeals and motions, setting briefing schedules, managing the docket and issuing Board decisions. 

The Board is currently engaged in a major backlog reduction initiative for its overall caseload of immigration appeals.  The Attorney General issued a final rule requiring an enhanced case management procedure designed to reduce delays in the immigration appellate process and, during a transition period, reduce the Board?s backlog of pending cases (see 67 Fed. Reg. 54878; August 26, 2002).     

Currently, the clerk?s office at the Board is responsible for receiving, tracking and responding to all OIL requests for certified ROPs. Some requests are generated by Assistant U.S. Attorneys through OIL to the Board. Generally speaking, the certification process has six steps: Step 1. OIL staff (paralegal(s)) submit daily requests for certified ROPs using a standard form that is faxed to the clerk?s office; Step 2.The clerk?s office reviews the OIL request to verify alien?s name and number and to determine the location of the ROP - many times the ROP is with the local immigration court, retired at the Federal Record Center or it may be pending at the Board. Step 3. Once the clerk?s office has determined the location of the ROP, the request for certification is entered into an automated case tracking system and the ROP is ordered to be delivered to the Board.(The average ROP is approximately 2 inches thick). Step 4. Upon receiving the ROP, the automated case tracking system is annotated to reflect the received date. The ROP is filed and copied according to the court due date provided by OIL,  placed in the proper order per established procedures and requirements by the Federal courts, paginated and indexed for easy reference. Step 5. Multiple copies of the certified ROP are made. The number of copies varies and usually does not exceed five copies depending upon the requirements of the particular Federal court to receive the certified ROP. Step 6.The certified ROP and copies, along with an official memorandum attesting that the documents are certified ROPs, are delivered daily to OIL by special messenger.     
				
During Fiscal Years (FY) 1998 through 2001, the clerk?s office received and processed between 1,500 to 2,000 requests to certify ROPs. On average, the clerk?s office received 166 requests per month.  During FY 2002, the number of monthly requests for certified ROPs increased, significantly, as a result of an unprecedented volume of BIA decisions issued each month and, in turn, increased litigation and judicial review of immigration matters in Federal courts. From June 2002 through September 2002, the clerk?s office received nearly 2,000 new requests for certified ROPs and averages approximately 550 requests per month. Currently, the clerk?s office has over 1,200 pending requests for certified ROPs with a backlog of 830 cases now overdue to the Federal courts. 

The Federal courts and OIL demand and expect quick turn-around times (TAT) for certified ROPs.  Generally speaking, the certified ROP is due to OIL between 6 days to 2 weeks from the date of its request.  Certified ROPs for Federal district courts require the faster TAT - one week.  On occasion, OIL will request - and receive approval from - the Federal courts for an extension of time to deliver the certified ROP.  

Quality is determined by OIL and generally means that the certified ROP reflects the complete and accurate legal documentation reviewed and considered by local and appellate  immigration judges.  The quality goal is zero-tolerance due to the urgent nature of the certification process, and the time standards and demands placed by the Federal courts.

The certification function requires at a minimum the following staffing composition: Requesters (requesting and receiving the ROPs), Copiers- personnel to copy the initial ROP and provide multiple copies of the certified ROP, and Verifiers (compare the initial copy to the ROP).

Any certification process issues and customer concerns are addressed through existing OIL and EOIR working groups. Daily operational communications are handled by a single point of contact for OIL and for the clerk?s office.  OIL provides a weekly report, by internal DOJ e-mail, identifying priority requests. The clerk?s office reviews this priority, adjusts work assignments and provides a status report, by return DOJ e-mail, to OIL within 24 hours of receiving the report. 
After completing the certification, the ROP is stored for 3 month at the clerk?s office. After this temporary storage, the ROP is returned to one of the 50+ local immigration courts for retirement to a Federal Records Center (FRC).  While the ROP is in the custody of the clerk?s office, it is bar coded and its location in a central file room is documented, by function, cabinet and date/time in its automated case tracking system. 

Attention to detail is vital when certifying ROPs for OIL and Federal courts.  These customers are accustomed to receiving high quality (i.e., accurate, complete, well-organized, and a comprehensive index for quick reference by attorneys and court personnel)  ROPs certified by EOIR.  Continuous staff training and regular quality checks of certified ROPs are required.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to identify potential domestic sources and gather information on current capabilities within the domestic market.  This notice is neither a solicitation for, nor request for competitive proposals. Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating a procurement to expand the domestic production capacity for melt-processible, isotropic, amorphous, rigid-rod polyparaphenylene polymeric materials for military and commercial applications as well as to develop affordable production methods for these materials.  The structural performance of the material should exceed currently available isotropic non-fiber-reinforced materials.  A dual use production capacity of at least 100,000 lb/yr, for both military and commercial applications, is desirable.  Under the authority of the DPA, any potential acquisition is restricted to sources with domestic production capabilities; therefore, firms without domestic production capabilities are ineligible for any potential award.  The principal objectives of this effort are the development and qualification of isotropic, amorphous, melt-processible rigid-rod polymeric materials while concurrently working towards achieving independent financial viability by addressing the needs of both government and commercial customers.

SUBJECT: FEDERAL BENEFITS CONFERENCE EXHIBITS 
DESC: The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's annual Federal Benefits Conference, 2003 Benefits Unmasked, will be held at the Sheraton Greensboro Hotel at Four Seasons, Greensboro, NC, on June 3 - 6, 2003. This year the Federal Benefits Conference will have a vendor exhibit area on June 4 and 5. The annual Federal Benefits Conference is a major U.S. Office of Personnel Management Retirement and Insurance Service initiative. The purpose of the conference is to update the group on initiatives in the area, share information among agencies about actions some have taken to deal with benefits education, increased workloads, etc., and address crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, Social Security, workers compensation, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. The conference will include payroll-related topics and will have sessions on interactions between payroll and human resource functions. In the past approximately a third of the attendees were Federal agency headquarters level staff who are responsible for administering the benefits program within their agencies. The other attendees were field staff with benefits administration responsibilities at the field level. Last year, approximately 650 agency representatives attended the conference. We expect about 700 attendees at this year's conference. Exhibitors Information: Thirty exhibit spaces are available. Exhibit spaces will be allocated on a first come first served basis. Registration must be received by April 11, 2003. The exhibit area will be in public areas of the hotel. Exhibitors may set up beginning at 8:00 AM, June 4th. Exhibits must be removed by 4:00 PM, June 5th. Conference sessions begin at 8:30 AM each day and end at 4:30 PM. Conference attendees will have a number of opportunities to visit the exhibit area on June 4th and 5th. The staffed exhibit booths will be 8' by 10' with pipe and drapes and will include signage, an electrical outlet, one table and 2 chairs. The cost of a staffed exhibit booth is $895 for an 8' by 10' booth. VCR with monitor is available for an extra charge of $ 110 per day; a phone line is available for an extra charge of $50 per day ($100 per day for DSL) plus the cost of calls.   Optionally, exhibitors can be provided a staffed distribution area, from which the materials you provide will be made available from a tabletop equal to ? of a 6-foot table. The Distribution booth area will have pipe and drapes, signage, tables.  Materials will be periodically replenished until supplies are exhausted.  Cost of an unstaffed distribution area will be $625. Exhibitors will rent the space directly from the Sheraton Greensboro Hotel at Four Seasons, as facilitated by their contract with an on-site display company. However, the rental application and checks will come to the Office of Personnel Management. Checks must be made payable to the Sheraton Greensboro Hotel at Four Season. Participation in the exhibit area does not mean that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in any way endorses or approves the vendor or its products or services. Exhibitors may not represent in any way that their participation at the Federal Benefits Conference represents any endorsement or approval by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. For additional information and an exhibit area registration form please call (202) 606-4900 or email fedbenconf@opm.gov.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) along with NCI's contractor, SAIC-Frederick Inc., plan to jointly conduct systems development for ovarian cancer diagnosis utilizing the Applied Biosystems Q-Star mass spectrometer on or about February 1, 2003 in anticipation of a clinical trial pursuant to an FDA Pre-market Application.  Q-ToF mass spectrometry coupled with pattern recognition software can differentiate protein expression levels in serum from ovarian cancer patients versus healthy individuals by displaying diagnostic patterns of protein expression in the disease state (Lancet 359, 572-577).  Thus, this technology may offer a non-invasive method to detect ovarian cancer in the early stages.  Questions concerning this effort may be directed to Kevin Brand, J.D., Technology Transfer Branch, NCI; phone: 301-496-0477, email: brandk@mail.nih.gov.
