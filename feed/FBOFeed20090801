The purpose of this task order is to provide support staff to supplement and enhance the Community Service Block Grant, American Recovery and Reinvention Act (CSBG/ARRA) program administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS), through compliance monitoring, technical assistance, to enhance the government financial, administrative, and programmatic reviews of CSBG/ARRA grantees identified by the Division of State Assistance (DSA).  The contractor shall be responsible for providing qualified staff (to include, but not be limited to Certified Public Accountants, auditors, financial management and program specialists) to assist in conducting such reviews.  It is envisioned that the contractor will provide a team of qualified personnel to work with OCS Federal staff to suggest improvements to the design of a monitoring system and the conduct of reviews.
b.	Successful completion of this contract will improve the administration of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) portfolio of grants, thereby enhancing ACF’s stewardship of taxpayer money.  Outcomes may include recommendation to provide technical assistance to help grantees correct issues as well as decisions not to continue funding of existing grants in those instances where the grantee and/or subgrantee has not clearly and convincingly demonstrated satisfactory progress in accomplishing stated goals and objectives in its initial year or deny funding of new requests for funding to organizations where reviews have shown areas of significant concern.
c.	It is expected that the end result of the reviews will be to assist OCS in establishing internal controls that provide assurances that ARRA grantees and subgrantees are effectively and efficiently in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and are able to effectively implement their grants.

<DESC>The National Institute Of Standards And Technology (NIST) Intends To Negotiate, On a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(1)(b) , with the Janice Research Company, Inc., P.O. Box 696, Wilmington, MA 01887, for the purchase of 1 ea:
Retrofit Safety Venting System on Top-Loading Closed-Cycle Refrigerator System (TLCCR) Sample Positioners.

1.	Sample positioners shall include a safety venting system that prevents the dangerous buildup of pressure in the bottom of the sample well in the event of an ice blockage at a midpoint of the sample well.
2.	Sample positioners will retain the same length as in original manufacture.
3.	The sample stick shall be adjustable in height plus/minus 1.5 inches from its nominal position.
4.	Connection to the smaple shall be a 5/16-18 threaded stud with a maximum length of 0.375 inches.
5.	Sample positioners must be compatible with the top-loading closed-cycle refrigerator configurations for which they were originally intended.
6.	Sample positioners will be retrofitted as necessary with an with an electrical connector.


The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a user facility providing neutron scattering measurement capability that is among the best in the world. An important part of the Instrumentation required to perform a successful experiment is the sample environment equipment, which controls the temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. of the sample under study. This equipment must be continually updated or expanded based on the needs of the scientific user community. The purpose of this procurement is to retrofit and additional safety feature into the existing fleet of top-loading close –cycle refrigerators manufactured by Janis Research company, Inc.

Janice Research Company makes the top loading closed-cycle refrigerators (TLCCR) that are the subject to the retrofitting in this procurement. These TLCCR’s are custom designed by Janis to NIST’s specifications to use in neutron scattering experiments. Additional TLCCR’s were purchased over a period of years. All of the TLCCR’s are of modular construction and must be compatible with each other.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

Requirement for locks/cores is revised to now read Best Brand Name or "Equal" will be considered by the Government for this project.  b. Specifications Section 08 71 00, Door Hardware, is deleted in its entirety and Specifications Section 08 71 00, Door Hardware, included herein is incorporated into and made a part of the solicitation and any resulting contract.c. Geotechnical Engineering Services Report dated December 16, 2008, is attached and incorporated into and made a part of the solicitation and any resulting contract.  d. Geotechnical Engineering Services Report dated February 6, 2009, is attached and incorporated into and made a part of the solicitation and any resulting contract.  e. Response to questions received:1) Please provide specification for Termite Treatment.RESPONSE:  Termite Treatment not required.2) Sheet S311 Detail 6 indicates a caisson cap below, however, a caisson is not indicatedon the foundation plan (Sheet S104). Please advise.RESPONSE:  Detail 6/S311 is correct.  Refer to enlarged plan 1/S104.  The cap encompasses the elevator basement area adjacent to the existing structure as indicated in 1/S104.  All caissons are marked in enlarged plan 1/S104 as indicated in the general notes sheet symbols.  Refer to sections 1/S310 and 1/S311 for cross sections. 3) Are all caissons at stair/elevator and adjacent to existing building at 10 ' depth accordingto notes #12 S101 and # 14 S104?RESPONSE:  For caissons shown on sheet S104 refer to note 12 on the same sheet.  Caisson callouts on sheet S104 do not include the top of caisson callout as shown in the general notes sheet symbols due to text congestion on the sheet.  For sheet S101, the wording for plan note 12 shall be changed too - "For caissons that have undefined top of caisson elevation as defined in the general notes sheet symbols, top of caisson to be at bottom of existing building foundation.  Contractor to coordinate.  For bidding purposes, use top of caisson elevation equal to -10'-0."  This primarily occurs along grids J and H where the caisson cap is located.  Top of caisson elevations south of grid H are provided in the callout. 4) Alternate # 4 indicates to delete the third floor construction in its entirety. Does this meanstructure and finishes or just finishes?RESPONSE: Yes the third floor construction will be deleted in its entirety under alternate #4 including both structure and finishes.  If this alternate is executed, drawing A301 detail C1 will now be called Roof at 3rd floor level.  Detail C3 will now be called 2nd floor Equipment Room where by the elevator equipment room will now be at the second floor level. On drawing A121 the Elevator Lobby will now be an Elevator Equipment Room with the same finishes as the elevator equipment room. Door 202 will be maintained for access from the roof to the elevator equipment room.  All work in Corridor 2S-01 shall be eliminated.    5)  Alternate # 3 Item 1b states that "regular doors, door frames and hardware shall beprovided in lieu of special " What is meant by "special".RESPONSE: Hardware groups 170 and 171 require a special door and frame.  The frame is a cased opening with a retractable door stop. The door has pivot sets and will require rounded edges so that it can swing both ways.  The edge of the door will have a recess on three sides for sight proofing so sound and visual privacy can be maintained in the room. If this bid alt is executed then these special door, frames and hardware will not be required.   6) S310 shows 'new concrete pilasters', plan does not show. Please provide size,reinforcing etc.RESPONSE: Refer to foundation plans 1/S101 and 1/S104.  Pilasters are square or rectangular and are shown dashed. 7) Where is the concrete column schedule shown?RESPONSE: The concrete pilasters are shown on the foundation plans on sheets 1/S101 and 1/S104. There are detail references on these plans that take you to the typical section where dimensions and reinforcing are called out. f. No further questions will be accepted for this project.
