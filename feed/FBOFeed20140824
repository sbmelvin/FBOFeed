<DESC>The Office of Administration for Children and Family (ACF) within the Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The National Academies of Sciences under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the project entitled, " Forum on Investing in Young Children Globally" using FAR Part 15 procedures<br />The purpose of this contract is to develop a consensus report on career pathways for "middle skills jobs" - technical jobs that do not require at least a baccalaureate degree. By commissioning papers and convening an expert panel, the contractor (NAS) will develop a consensus document that describes the pathways for middle skills jobs. <br />The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will develop a consensus study of the multiple education and training pathways- so called "middle skills" jobs. The NAS will convene an expert committee to examine the coverage, effectiveness, and flexibility of these avenues of technical preparation and skill certification and the extent of coordination among them. After reviewing the social science and program evaluation literature, the committee will commission papers and convene a national symposium to gather additional evidence related to these topics. Based on its review of the evidence, the committee will author a consensus report with conclusions and action-oriented recommendations for improving the system of technical education, training, and certification and for communicating options to citizens interested in pursuing careers in such occupations. The report will guide federal and state policymakers and administrators, educators, employers, labor organizations, and other stakeholders in preparing Americans for middle-skill jobs supporting middle-class livelihoods and in meeting employer needs for a skilled, competitive workforce. The study will initially focus on pathways to technical jobs in fields such as manufacturing, energy, information technology, transportation, biotechnology and health care. <br />Deliverables and Consideration<br />In support of the work to be completed, the NAS will produce three deliverables <br />&bull; A Review of the Literature and a Set of Commissioned Papers<br />The NAS will provide ACF with a review of the literature on middle skills jobs as well as draft and final versions of a set of commissioned papers on the topic.<br />&bull; Convening Symposium
<p>The NAS will convene a symposium of experts to provide their expert opinions and input on the subject. NAS will provide ACF with the opportunity to provide input on Symposium participants and will present ACF with a copy of symposium proceedings.</p>
<p>&bull; Committee Selection, Committee Deliberations and Consensus Report<br />NAS will select a committee to deliberate and discuss the consensus recommendations. ACF will be provided with input on selection of committee members, access to committee deliberations and the opportunity to review and comment on the consensus report before final production.<br />The NAS is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks described above. First, they have unique access to decision-makers coupled with a history of consensus decision-making that will produce an authoritative report that carries the weight of the National Academies. Second, NAS is prepared to execute the above tasks in a timely and responsive manner. In contrast to other potential sources, NAS may accomplish these tasks with greater ease and a lower cost. Finally, unlike other sources, the NAS has a prepared dissemination plan that represents the most efficient and best approach to the government. Repeatedly NAS has demonstrated that they have an approach to dissemination that is likely to reach the relevant policymakers and authorities. <br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency, electronically to Bryan Daines at bryan.daines@psc.hhs.gov. Responses are due by September 09th 2014 by 9:00 am EST. Responses will not be accepted after the due date. If no capability statements or proposals are received which specifically demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements above, the Government shall proceed with negotiating a Cost plus no fee order with The National Academies of Sciences Institute of Medicine</p>
