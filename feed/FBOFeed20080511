<DESC>ENVIRONMENTAL ENTERPRISE SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) has teamed with the Regional Contracting CenterFort Bragg (RCC-FB) to conduct a Natural Resource and Cultural Resources Industry Day in Denver, Colorado on 3-4 June 2008.  Please reference the original Sources Sought on FedbidzOpps.gov at the attached link  https://www.fbo.gov.<BR><BR>The purpose of this supplementary Sources Sought notice is to notify potential offerors in the western United States to the Cultural Resources and Natural Resources Industry Day Conference.  Any offeror may attend this Industry Day; however, the previous Industry Day held 30-31 January 2008 in Baltimore, MD demonstrated adequate interest on the part of firms located in the east, but lacked sufficient western (e.g., California, Utah, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona) interest and participation.  Therefore, it is determined that holding another Industry Conference in the west and requesting capability statements from western oriented firms was necessary.  IMCOM and the RCC-FB hope that doing this will provide a clearer picture of the ability of small business to support the conceptual acquisition strategy of an nationwide ID/IQ approach for Cultural and Natural Resources.  <BR><BR>Cultural and Natural Resources Western Industry Conference:  The goal of the RCCFort Bragg and IMCOM is to continue and expand the dialogue with industry in the West regarding the conceptual acquisition strategy and the draft PWS for both enterprise areas.  In order to facilitate this dialogue an Western Industry Conference has been scheduled for June 3-4, 2008 at the Red Lion Hotel, 4040 Quebec Street, Denver, Colorado for Natural Resource and Cultural Resource only.  Interested sources (including large businesses) should download the registration form at the USAECs website http://aec.army.mil/usaec/business/index.html and fax (910-396-5603) it to Ms. Anna Walker or Mr. Chris Friere.  Only one registration form per company or team is required to attend the conference, even if responses are submitted on more than one enterprise area Sources Sought Notice.  Registrations forms need to be submitted by 4pm EDT on 29 May 2008.  The Government will present general information about the acquisitions and requirements for the capability statements to all attendees on the afternoon of 3 June 1 pm  3 pm. Following the general presentations and discussions, the Government will conduct up to 17 one-on-one sessions each for the Cultural Resources and Natural Resources enterprise areas between potential prime contractors and representatives from USAEC and the RCCFort Bragg on the afternoon of June 3 from 4 pm- 5 pm and June 4 from 8 am - 5 pm.  These sessions will be limited to 20 minutes and should be used by potential small business prime contractors to address questions regarding each draft PWS or the conceptual acquisition strategy that they may not want to address in the open forum of the industry conference.  These sessions are not intended to serve as a meet/greet or a presentation of capabilities.  Reservations for these sessions will be taken as part of the registration for the industry conference in the order that they are received until all sessions are full.  While the number of one-on-one sessions is limited for this conference, firms that are not able to schedule a one-on-one at this time may submit e-mail comments to Ms. Anna Walker.  Large businesses will be offered one-on-one sessions only if space is available as the initial focus will be on small business issues/concerns.  Due to interest expected in this acquisition, the Government will not be providing individual responses to contractor inquiries, but will review and consider all comments for their possible use in the development of the acquisition strategy.  The Government does intend to have at least one more industry conference prior to the finalization of the acquisition strategy and the release of any resultant solicitation.  <BR><BR>It is the RCC-FBs intent that the capability statements from interested small businesses from the western region will reaffirm the initial research that it may be possible to set-aside both of these enterprise ID/IQ contracts for performance by Small Businesses (to include information on the possible participation by Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses).  Responses from Large Business to this Sources Sought Notice are not required at this time.   <BR><BR>While each of the enterprise contracts is separate and distinct from the others, the RCC-FB is only issuing a single Sources Sought Notice.  Contractors may respond to both of the enterprise areas; however, they must submit separate responses to each area as detailed below.  <BR><BR>The Cultural Resources enterprise approach will consist of providing technical assistance to the Army and other military components with cultural resources requirements in three broad categories:  (1) Survey, inventory, or investigation of historic properties and cultural resources, (2) Mitigation of adverse effects to historic properties and cultural resources, and (3) Program and execution of cultural resources management activities.  Proponents will be expected to demonstrate broad expertise in these areas and all regions of the US where Army installations may require support.  Consequently, proponents are asked to consider partnerships or other mechanisms of working with one or more other firms to provide coverage in areas where they may lack expertise.<BR><BR>The Natural Resources enterprise approach will consist of providing technical assistance to the Army and other military components with natural resources requirements to include two broad categories of services:  (1) Survey, inventory, or investigation of natural resources and (2) Program and execution of natural resources management activities.  Proponents will be expected to demonstrate broad expertise in these areas, some specific species support and all regions of the US where Army installations may require support.  Consequently, proponents are asked to consider partnerships or other mechanisms of working with one or more other firms to provide coverage in areas where they may lack expertise.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.  The Government will not award a contract based on this Sources Sought Notice nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  This is a request for small businesses interested in serving as prime contractors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they could meet the requirements specified in each of the enterprise areas.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620.<BR><BR>Submission shall be limited to no more than ten (10) pages and must be submitted for each separate enterprise area. No more than four (4) pages should be used to address the Contracting Topics and no more than six (6) pages for each Draft PWS and Requirements Related topics.   All questions are listed below.
