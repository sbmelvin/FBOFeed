<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION RATINGS<br />COLOR RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Blue Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies.<br />Purple Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains at least one strength and no deficiencies. <br />Green Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of requirements. Proposal has no strengths or deficiencies. <br />Yellow Marginal Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. <br />Red Unacceptable Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies and is unawardable.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL RISK RATINGS<br />RATING DEFINITION<br />Low Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome and difficulties. <br />Moderate Can potentially cause disruption of schedule or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties. <br />High Is likely to cause significant disruption or schedule or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties, even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.</p>
<p><br />(2) FACTOR 2 - Price: Offerors will be evaluated on the GRAND TOTAL price resulting from the estimated total amounts of all items list in CLIN 0001. Unbalanced prices may serve as a basis for rejection of the proposal. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and completeness of the total evaluated price. Prices will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness total evaluated price</p>
<p>(i) Arithmetic Discrepancies. For the purpose of initial evaluation of offers, the following will be utilized in resolving arithmetic discrepancies found on the face of the bidding schedule as submitted by the offeror.</p>
<p>(A) Obviously misplaced decimal points will be corrected;<br />(B) Discrepancy between unit price and extended price, the unit price will govern; <br />(C) Apparent errors in extension of unit prices will be corrected;<br />(D) Apparent errors in extended prices per CLIN will be corrected.</p>
<p>(3) FACTOR 3 - Past Performance: Past Performance will be evaluated based on subjective assessment of how well the offeror performed on recent and relevant work, as outlined in FAR Provision 52.212-1. Past performance references of a joint venture partner, key subcontractor, or instances where the offeror performed as a key personnel or a key subcontractor will be accepted. For the purpose of assessing acceptable performance, ratings S (Satisfactory), G (Good) and E (Exceptional) assigned by references will be considered "Acceptable". M (Marginal) and U (Unsatisfactory) will be considered "Unacceptable". The rating is based upon offeror-provided references, received Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies; FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; FAR 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Test Messaging while Driving; FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act - Supplies; FAR 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management; and FAR 52.247-64, Preference for Privately Owned U.S.-Flag Commercial Vessels.</p>
