<DESC><strong>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!</strong> The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for seismic analysis equipment. This is to include 3-Channel digitizer, Communication Interface Module Plus, CM3 and the ability to reproduce the manuals for the Digitizers, Communication Multiplexer, Station Processor, Authenticator, and the CIM3 Plus.
<p>Salient Characteristics:</p>
<p>Digitizers and Firmware: 24-bit analog-to-digital converter, an 18-bit calibration channel, a temperature-compensated VCXO phase-locked to GPS time, an EIA-232 configuration port, 256 FLASH EPROM, 512 KB SRAM (up to 8 MB SRAM in the AIM24S-3 model), and a user-configurable sample rate from 4 samples per second to 2560 samples per second. High-speed EIA-232 or EIA-422 interface supporting synchronous or asynchronous ADCCP communications. Designed for very low noise performance at low frequencies, for application with broad-band seismometers and to provide up to three input channels. Enclosed in rugged containers for placement in 4-inch diameter boreholes.</p>
<p>The CIM 3: is the communications interface between the field station and the local command and control. Building on the success of the CIM 3, the next generation CIM 3 is more capable and flexible, with greatly improved size, power demands, and reliability. The CIM 3 provides multipoint and multidrop array control over standard radio modems, a more flexible TCP/IP connection that can be routed over longer distances, and a flexible network appliance using high-integration components with the power of the Linux Operating System. Important features of the CIM 3 include verification of remote commands, one diagnostic RS-232 port, and an Intel PXA (StrongArm) processor. The compact, multipurpose CIM 3 is the only COTS product that both satisfies current treaty monitoring requirements and provides a standard software development platform that will be able to easily satisfy future requirements.</p>
<p>This is a Sole Source with Science Horizons, Inc. IAW FAR 6.302-1. IAW FAR 5.207(c)(15) Science Horizons, Inc.is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement Science Horizons, Inc.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />&#9633; (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />&#9633; (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -</p>
<p>Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing,<br />performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of<br />these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and<br />research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or<br />differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or<br />research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend<br />appropriate action.</p>
<p>(b) General Guidelines</p>
<p>1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.</p>
<p>2. In performing or presenting the results of scientific activities under the contract, and in responding to allegations of scientific and research misconduct, the Contractor shall comply with the provisions herein and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-735D, Scientific Integrity, and its Procedural Handbook, including any amendments thereto. That Order can be found at <br />http://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/ames/administrative_orders/chapter_202/202-735-D.html</p>
<p>3. Primary Responsibility. The Contractor shall have the primary responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate allegations of scientific and research misconduct. Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall promptly conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of such misconduct and may rely on its internal policies and procedures, as appropriate, to do so.</p>
<p>4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Investigating Misconduct Research</p>
<p>1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.</p>
<p>b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.</p>
<p>2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).</p>
<p>(d) Findings and Corrective Actions</p>
<p>1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:<br /><br />a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and</p>
<p>b. Coordinate remedial action with the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Department of Commerce Actions</p>
<p>1. The Department of Commerce may accept the Contractor's findings or proceed with its own investigation, in which case the Contractor shall fully cooperate with the investigation. The Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor of the Department's final determination.</p>
<p>2. The Department of Commerce reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract and applicable laws and regulations.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />&#9633; (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />&#9633; (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

52.204-16  COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY CODE REPORTING (JUL 2015)
  (a) Definition. As used in this provision-
  Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code means-
    (1) An identifier assigned to entities located in the United States or its outlying areas by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch to identify a commercial or Government entity; or
    (2) An identifier assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or by the NATO Support Agency (NSPA) to entities located outside the United States and its outlying areas that the DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an NCAGE code.
  (b) The Offeror shall enter its CAGE code in its offer with its name and address or otherwise include it prominently in its proposal. The CAGE code entered must be for that name and address. Enter "CAGE" before the number. The CAGE code is required prior to award.
  (c) CAGE codes may be obtained via-
    (1) Registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. If the Offeror is located in the United States or its outlying areas and does not already have a CAGE code assigned, the DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch will assign a CAGE code as a part of the SAM registration process. SAM registrants located outside the United States and its outlying areas shall obtain a NCAGE code prior to registration in SAM (see paragraph (c)(3) of this provision).
    (2) The DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch. If registration in SAM is not required for the subject procurement, and the offeror does not otherwise register in SAM, an offeror located in the United States or its outlying areas may request that a CAGE code be assigned by submitting a request at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cage_welcome.asp.
    (3) The appropriate country codification bureau. Entities located outside the United States and its outlying areas may obtain an NCAGE code by contacting the Codification Bureau in the foreign entity's country if that country is a member of NATO or a sponsored nation. NCAGE codes may be obtained from the NSPA if the foreign entity's country is not a member of NATO or a sponsored nation. Points of contact for codification bureaus and NSPA, as well as additional information on obtaining NCAGE codes, are available at 
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/nato/ObtainCAGE.asp.
  (d) Additional guidance for establishing and maintaining CAGE codes is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cage_welcome.asp.
  (e) When a CAGE Code is required for the immediate owner and/or the highest-level owner by 52.204-17 or 52.212-3(p), the Offeror shall obtain the respective CAGE Code from that entity to supply the CAGE Code to the Government.
