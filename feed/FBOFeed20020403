<DESC>The Air Vehicle Structures Division at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, Maryland is tasked to provide engineering services to support the development of methodologies and designs for composite Trailing Edge Flap components for the F/A-18C/D aircraft.  This effort is directed towards increasing the life of these components through the application of modern materials, analytical prediction and simulation of component usage.  This requirement is for sole source procurement to the Boeing Company in St. Louis, Missouri, to provide engineering services for design development, component fabrication and component testing. The effort requires details of the design requirements, geometric constraints, and an analytical assessment of the adequacy of the existing design specific to the F/A-18C/D aircraft.  It is anticipated that a Cost Plus Fixed Fee level of effort contract will be awarded for an approximate four-year period of performance.  The period of performance runs from the date of the award for an approximate base period of eighteen (18) months with two (2) option periods.  The estimated level of effort for the entire program is approximately 84,000 hours.  The government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Boeing Company, St. Louis, Missouri, because as the original designer of the F/A-18C/D aircraft, Boeing is the only source that owns the data, knowledge, experience and skills required to provide these services.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy the government agency requirement.  See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate with the University of Georgia, Research Foundation, Inc. a follow-on contract to provide 221, 200/year infective larvae and adult worms of the filarial parasite Brugia Malayi.  The contractor shall furnish the specific strain and quantities of these parasitic worms according to the required procedures.  The primary objective for the use of these parasites is for studying human immunity to filariasis, a disease which causes elephantiasis in humans, and to develop an appropriate vaccine for the infection.  The high quality and well standardized parasite materials required under this contract are necessary to maintain the progress of on-going carefully controlled research studies being conducted by NIH.  In addition to the above, colonies of the mosquito Aedes Aequpti (Liverpool strain) are required to be maintained for the production of the infective larvae.  The parasitic materials derived from the mosquitoes must be collected, counted, stored, maintained and further processed in a manner required for this research study.  The larvae and adult worms which are required to be produced from the larvae, have to be stored until needed in a freezer (stored at -80 degree centigrade), and injected intraperitoneally into jirds or suspended in media 199 and shipped immediately by air express.  Sixty to ninety days later, adult worms will be collected from the peritoneal cavity of jirds and stored at 80 degrees centigrade until needed. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded for a Base Year with 6 twelve-month option periods. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, University of Southern California. The contractor will produce a market data information system of federal and state coastal and ocean economic data that will be a component of the National Ocean Economics Project (NOEP).  The Wrigley Institute which hosts a team of research institutions in this project is uniquely qualified because of its team's previous and current efforts to undertake the NOEP.  Specifically, the contractor shall:  (1) Design and develop a database that will be accessible over the Internet by a variety of users, including Federal, state and local agencies and the general public; (2) Collect, screen, format, and populate the data base with the following data from federal and state sources: (i) Core market data from federal government sources, including: Gross Product Originating (GPO), for all relevant parts of the NOEP ocean sectors covered in Census/BEA and Bureau of Labor Statistics, Data, at the state, county/coastal geography, and U.S. levels for 1997, Complete GPO plus population, employment, wage & salary estimates for NOEP sectors for 1990, 1997, and 2000 at national, state and coastal county/coastal geography level (this includes data collection for the following sectors: Coastal Construction etc., Tourism and Recreation, Living Resources, Offshore development, Ship and Boat Building, Marine Transportation, Real Estate, and Research and Development); (ii) Government expenditure data by coastal state and by federal government agency; (iii)State ocean economic data in addition to that collected from the core market data noted above; and (iv) technical assistance for three coastal states to complete the additional economic work to supplement the data collected above to fully reflect their ocean economies; and (3) Complete reports on economic data collected including reports on coastal state economic studies and a national report, describing market data for employment, wages and income data and publicly available Census data.  The NOEP is an effort to undertake the first comprehensive, in-depth analysis of the size and composition of the US ocean economy, covering the past 30 years.  It will form an important element of the U.S. statistical information infrastructure by providing data on ocean-related economic activities and resource trends.  The NOEP will serve NOAA and its constituents by providing data on ocean-related economic activities and resources that will be a valuable set of outcome indicators for performance evaluations, trends for predicting and managing the coast and coastal ocean, and key to analyses that govern natural and financial resource allocation decisions. With this information system, NOAA will have archived, retrievable economic data for its line offices to use to carry out their missions, such as to justify regulations and allocate resources.  This requirement will be used to initiate the first phase of the market data information system on the Internet.  Additional support for other components of the NOEP will be provided through an anticipated interagency agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency.  This is a notice of intent and not a notice of solicitation. Therefore no solicitation package exists. Award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures. However, all qualification statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Late responses will not be accepted. If no written responses with convincing documentation are received as to a company's documented and demonstrated ability to perform the work, an order shall be placed with the above organization. Potential offerors are required to direct all procurement related questions via e-mail to the attention of Ronald Loube at Ronald.J.Loube@noaa.gov. The Statement of Qualifications should be submitted to: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, AMD, 1305 East-West Highway, OFA61, Room 7604, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3281.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award (1) a sole source contract modification to modify and extend its existing contract (HQ0006-00-C-0008) with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for Scientific, Engineering, Technical and Administrative (SETA) support to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Joint Program Office (JPO) and (2) a follow-on sole source contract to CSC, for continued SETA support to the GMD JPO, primarily in Arlington, Virginia and Huntsville, Alabama.  The current contract will be modified to add 390,000 Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLHs) with an estimated price of $43,000,000 and extend the period of performance through November 30, 2002.  The follow-on contract, with a base period of two years plus three one-year options, will have an estimated 4,260,000 DPLHs at an estimated price of $384,000,000.  CSC will develop program strategy options and assess proposed strategies.  CSC will provide technical and engineering analysis to support Battle Management Command, Control, and Communications (BMC3).  CSC will also support the GMD Technical Director and the System Integration Directorate by evaluating contract baseline, baseline revisions and contractor progress, performing trade-off analyses, maintaining a GMD technology roadmap, developing test target and scenario requirements for the GMD Flight Test Program, providing software management, providing requirements and design engineering interface with the user, providing specialty engineering, providing GMD system verification requirements, providing a GMD Modeling and Simulation Support Plan, developing and maintaining the GMD System Level Test Requirements Document, assisting in configuration management activities, and supporting the JPO Risk management Board.  CSC will support the GMD Test and Evaluation program and the Business Management Directorate.  CSC will provide information technology support, develop and maintain web-based applications and tools to provide data and knowledge sharing capabilities for all team members, and support management decision making with real-time, program management information capabilities.  CSC will support program cost estimating, cost analysis, budget development and budget execution, as well as independent assessment support. CSC will provide direct administrative management support.  During this period, the GMD will establish a test bed capability by September 30, 2004, and accelerate the rate of flight tests to four tests per year.  Due to the risks and difficulties inherent in the expedited schedule and the nature of the support provided by CSC, a break in continuity would be unacceptable during this period and could jeopardize the program.  Based on its extensive and comprehensive experience with the GMD program, only CSC can provide the major system and leading edge technology experience, flexibility and continuity necessary to ongoing GMD JPO efforts without unacceptable delays for staffing, familiarization, and training.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Overseas Buildings Operations, anticipates awarding indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts to two small business concerns. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541330, $4.0 million average.  The small business concerns shall be professional, licensed firms to provide architectural (prime or JV) and engineering services for new construction projects, project planning, facility renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, and system replacement projects, physical and technical security upgrades, and the construction and renovation of post communications centers at foreign service posts worldwide.  Construction projects are not expected to exceed $10million.  Projects may include design-build definition or bridging work.  In those cases, as in large design-bid-build projects (where construction value is over $10 million), such projects may affect the A/E's ability to participate in follow-on work or design-build teams for that project.  Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum or $100,000 in task orders over the life of each contract.  The total amount of orders issued under each contract shall not exceed $5,000,000 per year.  The contract will be for professional services to include, but not be limited to, facility assessments and architectural and engineering studies, site utilization studies and master planning, preliminary designs, design development, construction documents, specifications, construction estimates, design reviews of other A/E firms, value engineering studies or reviews, and construction phase services.  This is not a request for proposals.  Services shall include all disciplines: architectural, including historic preservation, landscape architecture, master planning, space planning, electrical distribution systems, mechanical systems, structural, blast, civil/geotechnical engineering, seismic, security systems/engineering, lighting systems, acoustical engineering, chem-bio (NBC) engineering, information/telecommunications systems, cost estimating, food service, interior design, environmental, energy conservation and sustainability, fire protection and alarm systems, scheduling, value engineering, and vertical transportation, as well as routine administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved; and ascertaining and working within the U.S. Government?s requirements and the applicable laws, codes and standards at the overseas project sites.  Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  The preparation of construction documents via alternative documentation methods (e.g. design-bid-build plans, specifications, and design-build) is required.  Construction documents shall be submitted with AutoCAD version 2000 or higher (until October 2000, AutoCAD R14.01 or higher files are acceptable), for each submission.  In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offeror must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  Specifically designated personnel assigned to this contract must also possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).  Subcontractors which will require access to classified information must also possess a DoD Secret FCL.  All offerors will be required to comply with security requirements as detailed in the NISPOM.  If a selected offeror does not possess the necessary FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for an FCL.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  A period of six calendar months from selection of the final offeror will be allowed for this offeror to obtain the necessary FCL.  After this period the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding less than five contracts under this effort.  Firms, which form joint ventures, must also comply with the above FCL and personnel security clearance requirements.  Firms responding to this announcement on or before the closing date will be considered for selection using the following evaluation criteria - 100 points maximum:  a)  Specialized experience and technical excellence in facility planning and design, sustainable design, rehabilitation/renovation, adaptive reuse, and system replacement projects involving multiple disciplines (e.g. architectural, master planning, mechanical, civil/geotechnical, structural, electrical and interior design/space planning) for facility sites, office buildings, residences, warehouses, and other support facilities - 25 pts.  b)  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, as listed above.  Show any licenses, registrations, or other certifications, as well as awards and other indicators of high quality performance - 20 pts.  c)  Internal quality management plan, past performance, schedule, and cost control procedures.    Describe internal quality control and assurance plan and firm's ability to successfully provide and coordinate discipline efforts either in-house or with consultants.  If using consultants, demonstrate this success as a team in providing similar services.  Indicate effectiveness by listing award amount, A/E design schedule (planned vs. actual), final design estimate and construction change order rate for five projects within the past five years.  Provide this information in a matrix format.  Each firm's past performance(s) and performance ratings will be reviewed - 15 pts.  d)  Specialized experience and superior technical competence in 1) physical and technical security upgrades including security and surveillance systems and special forced entry and ballistic resistant construction and 2) the construction and renovation of communication centers and their associated power systems and physical and technical security requirements - 15 pts.  e)  Specialized experience and technical competence in the renovation and restoration of historically significant buildings - 10 pts.  f)  Specialized experience in design-build projects, including the preparation of bridging documents, writing performance requirements, and developing statements of work for design-build projects - 10 pts. 
g)  Previous experience with overseas projects and knowledge of foreign building codes and standards and construction practices - 5 pts.  Failure to address each of the evaluation criteria, in writing, will result in failure to qualify.  Additionally, failure to provide the requisite information will result in failure to qualify.  A/E firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit two copies of the following:  (a) Standard Form 254 Architect/Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire, (b) Standard Form 255 Architect/Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project (maximum of 100 pages).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC plans to purchase a prototype temperature monitoring and data acquisition system consisting of active RFID tags and one portable hand-held scanner with software to communicate with the tags.  The purpose of tags is to take time-temperature data from type-K thermocouples that are installed in a piece of aerospace thermal protection material to be tested in a hot environment.  Although this material will get hot on one side, the RFID tag will be placed in a relatively cool location (&lt;125 degree C).  The scanner is used to download data acquisition and clock parameters to the RFID tag, the tag then acquires time-temperature data according to its programming, and at some later time the scanner uploads the data.  (At this point the device should turn off to conserve battery power.)  The tag is reusable until the battery is drained.  Wireless communication and data processing are handled by software running on a standard Windows 98 or Windows 2000 based computer using a cable connection through a serial or USB port.  The RFID system may use any allowed communication frequency.   The intended application is self-contained data acquisition system for health and performance monitoring of space materials on hypersonic vehicles and in ground test facilities.  A simple demonstration device might be used 24 times in an office, each experiment lasting 1 hour.  A ground-test device might be used several times with each test lasting up to one day.  One flight experiment might last 2 weeks.  Test and flight conditions are likely to be low pressure environments.  Specifications are as follows: 1.	Tag maximum size goal of 2.54 cm square (or alternatively 6.4 square cm area) and maximum thickness of 0.5 cm including the battery.  Tag operating environment from  0 degree C to 125 degree C.  Provide attachment locations for three type-K thermocouples.  One thermocouple reference junction and one independent temperature measuring device must be placed on the tag.  (The tag temperature is used as the reference-junction temperature needed to convert thermocouple voltage into a temperature value.  Detailed calibration curves are readily available.) 2.  Hand-held scanner maximum size goal of 30 cm square and mass of 2 kg.  Scanner transfers data to/from tags from a distance of at least 15 cm.  Data are to be transferred in less than 10 s using any allowed frequency.  Scanner may use rechargeable batteries or 110 VAC for power.  Nominal cord lengths of about 2 to 3 m for connection of scanner to computer and power supply. 3.  The tag shall log data from the thermocouples and the reference temperature device at 1 to 10 sec intervals for up to 30 minutes (&lt;2048 data points per thermocouple) at TBD accuracy.  To conserve battery power, voltage to temperature conversion may be handled in software rather than in the tag.   4.  The software shall utilize a graphical user interface to enable and simplify user download and upload of data.  The software downloads user-defined run parameters and clock time to the devices.  The tag starts taking and storing data depending on a combination of time, temperature, and other user-defined run parameters.  For example the device may simply take data at some frequency and duration starting at some time.  Alternatively, the device might start recording data when a selected thermocouple reaches some specific temperature.  In this case the tag needs to check temperatures periodically to determine when the criteria to start data storage are met.  Time-stamped data, when uploaded, shall be graphically displayed and saved in a text file for reuse by the software and by other applications.   5.  Durability and lifetime:  all components shall withstand routine handling and shaking.  The system is expected to have a 2-year lifetime without service, with replaceable batteries on the tags if possible.  The tag and battery should be capable of supporting up to 24 uses each lasting 1 hour, several uses each lasting up to 1 day, and 1 use lasting 2 weeks (with possible exposure to vacuum). 6.  Deliverables: twelve prototype devices, one scanner, software to operate the devices (on CD), all supporting cables, final report, one portable carrying case, and training if required.  The final report includes system topology and a description on functioning/usage of the hardware and software.  The documentation may include a discussion of development issues/solutions as well as suggestions/options for further development.  The carrying case safely holds all hardware without being excessively large. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-06. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334513 and 500, respectively. The quoter shall state in their quotation their size status for this procurement. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to ARC is required within 90 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-A7.  Quotations for the items(s) described above are due by April 17, 2002 and may be mailed or faxed to NASA Ames Research Center, Acquisition Branch for Aeronautics, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000, Attn: Miin-Shiou Chen, Fax: 650-604-4357; and include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF ANNOUNCEMENT: In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures. <P> The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to enter into a single source contract with ASQ, Inc. for the acquisition of support services necessary to resolve  software, hardware, and database operational problems, and develop software/hardware  modifications to accommodate new requirements for the National Airspace Data Interchange Network message switching system (NADIN1), and the packet switching network (NADIN2).  ASQ, Inc. possesses the unique knowledge and necessary expertise to support operational field support, software/hardware corrections and maintenance, system enhancement development, test and integration for NADIN.  Also, ASQ, Inc. has been involved with the NADIN1 message switching system software development since the system went on-line in 1986. ASQ, Inc. has supported the operational system, and implemented a number of major enhancements.  Additionally, the learning curve for any other vendor besides ASQ, Inc. to gain the necessary expertise and knowl! edge for the NADIN system would not be cost effective or time sufficient and would jeopardize critical program milestones. <P> Therefore, a competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate the information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Jeanine Passetti, Contract Specialist, by 4 p.m., Eastern Time, April 5, 2002, at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Contracts Branch, ACT-51, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey 08405. <P>

<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce (DOC) to acquire an active hydrogen maser from Datum-Timing and Measurement, 34 Tozer Road, Beverly, MA 01915-5510.  The maser will be used in the ensemble of hydrogen masers that are used as a high stability frequency reference for the primary standard NIST-F1 and for the NIST time scale of UTC (NIST).  The maser must be an active maser and must have cavity auto tuning.  The minimum requirements the maser must meet are: frequency stability for t between 1 and 1,000 seconds better than 2E-13 t-3/2, stability between 1,000 and 10,000 seconds better than 3E-15, and long-term frequency stability better than 2E-16 per day.  The cavity auto tuning must not require an external reference.  Environmental sensitivities must be less than, 1E-14 per degrees Centigrade, 3E-14 per Gauss and 1E-14 when switching to any power source.  The frequency synthesizer resolution must be no more than 7E-17 and have a control range of 7E-10.  The maser outputs must be 5 MHz, 10 MHz, and 100 MHz at greater than 1 volt rms and 50 ohm output impedance.  The maser must operate from 110 VAC, have standby battery operation, and accept an external DC supply of 22 to 28 VDC.  The physical dimensions of the maser must not be larger (in any dimension) than 46 cm wide, 76 cm deep and 107 cm high.  This acquisition is a commercial item acquisition.  Interested firms must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date of posting of this synopsis.  This is not a formal solicitation.

The system will need to be modified to accommodate this change; d.  Develop Remaining Functions of the Case Tracking System:  The most important component of the Case Tracking System, ordering computer equipment and supplies, has been completed and implemented. Recently, a component to track general questions and issues was added. The following planned components still must be created:

The Citrx code has been modified to provide capabilities not provided by Citrix, such as the ability for users to change passwords. Additional capabilities may be required in the future, and modifications to existing capabilities may be needed.

	Task 2a.:  Provide support for the Citrix website on an as-needed basis.

3.  The Extranet Website:  Requires knowledge and experience as an iPlanet system administrator.

Task 3a.:  Maintain the Extranet and its three subordinate virtual sites, the EID site, the intern web site, and the externally-accessible portion of SFANet, resolving issues such as protecting certain sections of the site from public view, maintaining effective throughput, and resolving issues with access and passwords.  
Task 3b.:  Implement automatic deployment to all webservers on this site using the standard Teamsite tool. 

Provide Technical Web Support As Required:  Provide technical consulting to the IT Services staff on web questions in general.

2.	(40%)  Proven experience developing web applications to the J2EE standard.
3.	(10%)  Knowledge of the content standards used by Federal Student Loan web sites and the Department of Education common www.ed.gov web site.
4.	(10%)  Familiarity with (FSA) organization and web requirements.

For this solicitation, price will be a substantial factor in source selection; however, technical merit is significantly more important than cost or price.  The contracting officer will determine whether the difference in quality is worth the difference in price.

Interested parties should submit their proposals by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, April 10, 2002; to Roscoe H. Price, III, Contracting Officer, U.S. Department of Education, Federal Student Aid, Union Center Plaza, 830 First Street, NE, Room 101H4, Washington, DC  20202-5405.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is actively undertaking several research and development projects involving technologies that enable teaming operations between various Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms and manned rotorcra ft.  Some of these technologies will be demonstrated as part of the Hunter Stand-off Killer Team (HSKT) ACTD. The objective of this ACTD is to demonstrate new manned / unmanned teaming capabilities using existing mature technologies. The HSKT ACTD envision s improvements in the areas of airborne sensor-to-shooter timelines, manned platform stand-off range, and false target rejection. This Request for Information (RFI) specifically aims to gather information on Sensor Suites suitable for consideration in the HSKT ACTD. It is anticipated that selected sensors will be integrated with the Hunter UAV and delivered to the HSKT ACTD sponsor, Pacific Command (PACOM)/United States Forces Korea (USFK) for evaluation by operational units.  Additionally, other sensors may be select ed and integrated with other UAV assets (Vigilante, Agile Eagle, etc.) to demonstrate other surveillance and targeting capabilities.  These systems will be flight tested in the U.S., most likely at Ft. A. P. Hill. We are interested in information on EO/IR and RF sensors, Laser Range Finder/Designators, and related technologies to enhance precision geo-location. Viable candidates must have the size, weight, and power characteristics appropriate for integration on the Hunter. Candidate sensor system packages that will be considered include commercial or military products readily available or adaptable to this particular effort, as well as prototype systems that could potentially meet our needs with further, limited development. We expect to evaluate their capa bilities in locating and designating fixed as well as moving targets over land or water, and under day, night, concealment and adverse weather operating conditions. We are also looking for compatibility with TCDL uplink and downlink specifications for sens or controls, communications, and video transmission with various manned assets including Blackhawk and Apache. Appendix A includes a listing of the general requirements for the HSKT sensor suite.  Note that some of the specific system characteristics are i ntentionally blank, but the Government is interested in these characteristics relative to the candidate systems.  Information submitted by vendors should clearly identify performance measures such as the target location error (TLE) CEP and resolution for d ifferent ranges and modes of operation, coverage area, geo-location method used (GPS/DGPS, etc.), target detection and identification ranges, and automatic target recognition (ATR) capability.  There should be enough detail provided for the Government to m eaningfully assess relative capabilities.  Appendix B may be completed to convey the desired information.  DOWNLOAD THE APPENDICES AT THIS LINK: http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/Appendix%20AandB.doc.  This information will be used to understand current  industry capability and to assist in planning of Government research and development. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any follow-on contractual efforts. Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer, which could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. W ritten responses are requested by 30 April 2002; however earlier dialog is encouraged. Address responses to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn: AMSAM-RD-AA-I (Mr. Galvas or Dr. Moorthy), Bldg. 401, Lee Blvd, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Mr. Mike Galvas who is the focal point for EO/IR sensors/technologies may be reached by telephone at (757) 878-2377 or by email at mgalvas@aatd.eustis.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Pat Griffin, 301-744-6883
<DESC>The Department of Defense, Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technology Division is requesting information for Multiple Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Neutralization Systems. Descriptive literature to include detailed product data sheets, product quality, reliability, warranty, points of contacts, manufacturing quantity capacity and schedule, and pricing information for commercial and nondevelopmental systems are requested.  The purpose of the system is to provide EOD technicians the capability to rapidly and remotely neutralize multiple UXO (primarily scatterable submunitions) over a large area (approximately 50 feet x 5000 feet).  Desired system capabilities include: (1) high rate of effectiveness against small UXO threat items (2) ability to neutralize at least 25 items per hour for a minimum of 4 hours, (3) ability to protect the operator from the effects of the UXO,  either through remote standoff or other means, and (4) accuracy on target to between 1/8 and 1/2 at distances from 0 - 50 meters (100 meters preferred).  The information from this market research effort will be utilized to understand the ability of commercially and nondevelopmental items to meet projected needs.  Commercial and nondevelopmental, for this request, include systems that are still in development, but will be available in approximately less than five years from sources sought publication date.  System parameters are not absolute thresholds; they are supplied as a guidance to determine if the system could meet the needs of military EOD personnel.  The system is not necessarily required to meet all of the capabilities listed, they are supplied as a guidance.  This announcement is NOT a formal solicitation and is NOT a request for proposal.  Availability of any f ormal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantage business (SDB), a small woman-owned business (WO), or large business (L).  Each response must reference the sources sought title.  Information submitted should describe the contractors capability and/or past experience in performing the described services and will be used to develop a source of potential proposers for possible future solicitations.  Interested entities may submit faxed responses to Naval EOD  Technology Division, Attn: Pat Griffin at (301)744-4046 or send a email to griffinpa@eodpoe2.navsea.navy.mil.  Responses must be received no later than close of  business on April 29, 2002.  This is not a Req uest for Proposal(RFP).  There is no commitment on the part of the U.S. Navy to award a contract as a result of this request for information.

<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial applications the chemically reactive barrier mat, a new in situ method to prevent the migration of radioactive and/or hazardous wastes to the environment.  Use of the new barrier mat can reduce the degree and cost of physical barriers otherwise needed to ensure the integrity of a disposal site.  Multiple water permeable active layers, sandwiched between top and bottom layers and containing at least one reactive agent each, stabilize specific contaminants within the hazardous waste.  Reactive agents, selected for the type of waste to be contained, may be mixed within an active layer or separated into distinct active layers.  The permeability of the bottom layer can be adjusted to suit the environmental conditions under which the barrier mat will be used.  The mat may come in a long continuous roll which can be cut to size in the field.  Its flexibility will accommodate various surface contours.

For more information on the chemically reactive barrier mat and licensing opportunities contact Joseph P. Dugan, telephone (803) 725-0848 or (800) 228-3843; Fax: (803) 725-4988; email: joseph.dugan@srs.gov; or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #243, Aiken, SC  29808.  Responses to this notice should be received by May 3, 2002.  This is not a request for a formal subcontract; it is a request for interested parties and licensing opportunities only.

<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial applications a new method and apparatus for the in situ treatment of aquifers contaminated with volatile organic compounds.  In a novel approach, the method makes use of different hydraulic pressure between a contaminated aquifer and an uncontaminated aquifer in proximity.  Within a single device, multiple contaminants can be treated by different methods selected specifically for each contaminant.  The low-maintenance device is contained below ground with minimal support equipment required above ground.  To avoid the depletion of scarce underwater resources, treated water from the contaminated aquifer is reclaimed by deep recharge to the uncontaminated aquifer.  Using natural hydraulic gradients, the device draws water from a contaminated aquifer, sparges it with injected air, then releases the treated water to a second clean aquifer.  The resultant offgas is discharged through a venting system.  When air sparging is not sufficient, secondary options can be incorporated to treat multiple contaminants prior to the water being released.  U.S. Patent 6,280,625 has been issued on this invention.

For more information on the In Situ Remediation System for Volatile Organic Compounds and licensing opportunities contact Joseph P. Dugan, telephone (803) 725-0848 or (800) 228-3843; Fax: (803) 725-4988; email: joseph.dugan@srs.gov; or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #243, Aiken, SC  29808.

This code currently is being developed on the DTRA CRAY computer.  Continuation of this development in an effic ient manner and proper utilization of the code in a rapid prediction mode will require that the code migrate from the CRAY to an HPC massively parallel processor computer. The proposed work statement involves the means of this migration. The estimated doll ar value of this action is $990,000.00.
