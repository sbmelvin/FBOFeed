<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is procuring services under Solicitation HSCG84-07-Q-AA8183 which will be available on or about September 21, 2006 via FedBizOps. In an event of severe weather, during the hurricane season which runs from May 1 to November 30, members of the Joint Forces Offices (JFO) of the U. S. Coast Guard Sector New Orleans would need a safe location that is away from current hurricane and potential future hurricane hazards and dangers to lives. The facility would need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead U. S. Coast Guard post hurricane operations.  The U. S. Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the "first right" to use the facility in an event of severe weather affecting the Gulf shore resulting in evacuation of New Orleans, LA.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than tropical force winds, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for JFO stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit, this will require that USCG Sector New Orleans JFO members to stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  It is anticipated that the minimum period of time would be 3 days with a maximum of 42 days per occurrence.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The JFO location needs to be located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in order for the team to work out of the Integrated Command Post located in Baton Rouge.  A total of 25 hotel rooms will be needed.  Parking will be needed for up to 50 vehicles.  The NAICS code is 721110.  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing October 2006.  All vendors will be responsible for obtaining the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the above site.  Any and all questions regarding the solicitation should be submitted, in writing, to Mrs. Roberta Smith at Roberta.H.Smith@uscg.mil.  This requirement will be issued using Full and Open Competition procedures.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232.33.

<DESC>The contractor shall develop an automated CPA system for USTRANSCOM, Command, Control, Communications and Computer Systems Directorate (TCJ6), the CPA program at Scott AFB, IL.  The contractor shall provide business process analysis, software development, documentation, and support.  This contract will allow USTRANSCOM to begin fulfilling its mission to automate for the customs and border clearance process.
The general scope of the contract is to provide functional analysis support, system/software engineering, and software application support required for the development of new functional capabilities and the expansion of existing capabilities currently available on two prototype software applications.  The CPA program goal is to satisfy customs clearance requirements for all DOD shipments around the world with a single Automated Data Processing (ADP) system.  Currently there are two prototype applications operating, one in Germany and one in Korea.  The contractor shall create a single system that has the existing prototypes capabilities, identified requirements, and implementation for each of the 18 countries.  The CPA system shall provide a series of flexible alternatives for creating and transferring customs clearance information for multiple countries.  It shall provide a seamless system for creating, populating and transmitting customs and related shipping documentation, while maintaining continuous visibility of the customs/border clearance process.  Additionally, the CPA system shall provide metrics that will allow USTRANSCOM, regional Combatant Commands, Services and Defense Agencies the means to identify problem areas in documentation, shipment processing and policy guidance.
The end state of the CPA program will provide DOD the capability to provide electronic files in a format agreeable to the individual host nation foreign countries that can be used to identify DOD shipments for customs clearance purposes and will provide the necessary data to allow those shipments duty-free entry as provide for by the specific Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) for each individual country.  The CPA system shall strive to meet the above goal for the following countries:  Republic of Korea, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, Bahrain, Kuwait, Canada, Afghanistan, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Diego Garcia, Iceland, Iraq, Netherlands, Turkey, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.  The CPA system shall provided electronic files that will be used to generate customs clearance documentation in an electronic format.  The formats and language shall vary by destination host country to satisfy its requirements.  The system shall push clearance information to US customs clearance officers, foreign customs authorities and commercial and military carriers as required by the operating environment in the host country.  In those cases where shipments arrive in the host country without advance data, the system shall provide the capability to produce customs clearance documentation using data input by the carrier and/or consignee.  For those countries that cannot participate in full automation, the system shall provide the host nation with printed forms as required.  In addition, the system shall provide status, conduct surveillance, and measure performance.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), Quantico, VA has a requirement to execute a short bridge contract, on a sole source, task order basis, for a full range of engineering, analytical, technical, and business services. Period of performance for this bridge effort    is sixty (60) days, commencing 01 October 2006.  While the nature of the continued services that are required under the scope of the proposed bridge contract is generally known, the specific tasks to be ordered and accomplished over the performance period, as well as the allocation of work across MCWL is not specifically defined. These continuation/bridge services are considered to be available from only one source based on the substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay that would be realized to compete this short bridge effort in advance of a pending source selection. The proposed contractor has been performing these tasks without interruption for the past 5 years. The current support contract expires on 30 September 2006; however, the follow-on contract which is currently in the last stages of source selection will likely not be awarded before this date. The contracting office is limited in its ability to extend the current contract based on FAR 22.1002-1 and FAR 37.111. It is anticipated that the follow-on contract will be awarded within the desired period of performance of this anticipated bridge contract. The current contract was extended for a period of six months in accordance with FAR 16.505(c)(3). FAR 37.111, entitled Extension of Services, permits award of contracts for continuing services if there are circumstances beyond the control of the contracting office.  In addition, 22.1002-1, states in part, under 41 U.S.C. 353(d), services contracts may not exceed five (5) years.  The follow-on competitive acquisition for the current MCWL contract support services is currently in the source selection phase and award

These can be triggered off any event detected by any of the data systems allowing for up to 64 channels of voltage acquisitions with simultaneous time stamp and triggering.  The LDS systems are designed with the required high isolation impedance per channel to prevent leakage current on high voltage or long duration test. The LDS Test and Measurement 16 Channel Data Acquisition Systems stand alone has the advantage of being calibrated as a whole which prevents NASA/JSC from having to have operator certifications performed prior to each use as in necessary with other high channel count configurable data systems at JSC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 22, 2006.

Govt Response:  Short periods of downtime (1-2 hours) can be done after 6:00 PM during the business weekdays.  Extended downtime (5-6 hours) need to be done during the weekend.  Downtime needs to be kept to a minimum since the facility is a major hub for data communications that could affect emergency notifications and cause loss of life or property. 3.  QUESTION:  What is the desired battery back-up time?  Govt Response:  A minimum of 10 minutes run time at full load is required. 4.  QUESTION:  Unless we're missing it, we don't see any delivery schedule and/or completion date-please clarify.   Govt Response:  Completion date is not later than December 30, 2006. 5.  QUESTION:  Please confirm what the removal of the existing unit consists of; i.e. where do we have to locate it within the building and be done with our "moving" labor?   Govt Response:  The existing equipment will be removed from its current location and placed in a temporary holding space on the first floor.  Appropriate labor catagories are to be used in all work proposed under this solicitation. 6.  QUESTION:  Regarding the proposal format, are we limited to a quantity of pages and is the expectation for a full descriptive methodology, or simply price and manufacturers cut sheets?     Govt Response:  The solicitation stated: "Manufacture's literature of the proposed UPS system must accompany your quote to evaluate technical responsiveness".  There is no page limit limitation.  But the vendors should only submit the required cut sheets they feel can convey the pertinent data of the proposed UPS equipment for Government evaluation. 7.  QUESTION:  Will the award be based on best responsive bidder (methodology, history, qualifications, etc) or is the lowest price the only criteria?   Govt Response:  The method used will be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  Past Performance is always considered in Federal Contracting. ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW REMAIN UNCHANGED BY THIS AMENDMENT. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNOUNCEMENT E992906A032: CORRECTION TO ANNOUNCEMENT E9929060032, RFQ# Q9929060032, PROVIDE AND INSTALL NEW MGE GALAXY 4000 DATA CENTER UPS OR EQUAL. THE QUOTE DUE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION BLOCK OF THE ABOVE-REFERENCED COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT WAS LISTED AS 19 AUGUST 2006.  IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO READ 19 SEPTEMBER 2006. NO OTHER CHANGES ARE REFLECTED IN THIS DESCRIPTION BLOCK. Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), number Q9929060032 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  This is total small business set-aside procurement.  The Small Business size standard is $6 mil.  The NAICS is 811310.  The contract will be awarded as a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5.  The requirement is for providing and installing a new Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system for the purpose of providing continuous conditioned power to the network infrastructure for the National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office located at 240 W. 5th Ave., Anchorage, AK 99501.  When responding to this RFQ contractors shall provide pricing as follows: CLIN 0001, Provide and Install MGE Galaxy 4000 Data Center UPS OR EQUAL and disconnect and remove existing 18KVA UPS system; turn over to NPS IT Personnel for disposition.  $_____________  The quote must include all costs of installation including any necessary transformers or other ancillary equipment.   The proposed UPS system shall be capable of providing the following specification:  1. SCOPE. This item describes the requirements for the Contractor to provide and install a new 40KVA 3-Phase UPS System and remove the existing 18KVA UPS system at the NPS Regional Office located at 240 W. 5th Ave., Anchorage AK 99501.  The old 18KVA UPS system once removed will be turned over to NPS IT Personnel for Government disposition. (Government retains ownership).   2. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE UPS SYSTEM:  The UPS system will replace an existing single phase, 18KVA UPS system with a minimum of a 3-phase 40 KVA system.  The building is equipped with an emergency generator which assumes the load within 2 minutes of a power interruption therefore the proposed UPS must only be rated to provide a minimum of 10 minutes of output at full load.  The system will be located on the first floor, in the location of the existing UPS system, and will supply 3-phase power to one or more distribution panels in the 2nd floor server room.  The proposed system must be expandable to at least 50KVA without increasing the footprint beyond the approximate 3.5 foot X 6 foot area (exclusive of transformers) occupied by the current system.  The UPS system proposed must be manageable via an Ethernet network and any necessary software must be Microsoft Windows compatible.   3. SPECIFICATIONS:  All UPS power distribution must be from a breaker panel located in the server room.  The preferred location for the distribution panel is indicated on the accompanying server room diagram along with the existing Electrical panels and UPS outlets.  The existing 110 volt UPS outlets on the walls and near the 72 inch racks will be moved over to the new UPS system.  The 110 volt UPS outlets above the cabinets will be replaced with new outlets located more toward the front of the cabinets.  The panel nearest the door is a 3 phase 208/120 volt 100 amp panel that feeds the non-UPS outlets in the server room as well as lights and outlets in the adjoining Information Technology office and lab areas.  It also feeds the network distribution rooms on each floor.  The electrical panel currently furthest from the door is a single phase panel that feeds UPS power to the thirty two (32) 110 volt and four (4) 220 volt outlets indicated by red and green triangles in the drawing. (email Andy Toller at Andrew_Toller@nps.gov for instructions to download this drawing).  New 110 volt outlets must be mounted beneath the overhead wire basket location at or near the position shown on the diagram.  The cabinet nearest the door is the only one requiring 220 volt power.  Two (2) 110 volt outlets will be added to that cabinet.  The two (2) 220 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks will be converted to 110 volt UPS outlets.  All outlets will be locking to eliminate the adaptors currently in use.  The UPS outlets along the wall currently are fed with a single 20 AMP circuit for four (4) outlets while the other UPS outlets are fed with two (2) 20 AMP circuits each feeding duplex outlet.  The outlets that are just being switched from the old UPS to the new UPS will not change this scheme, however, the outlets being replaced above the cabinets will only require one (1) locking outlet per circuit.  The panel(s) installed will have sufficient breaker capacity to increase the number of 110 volt UPS circuits from forty-two (42) to sixty (60) so that future expansion will only require the addition of circuit breakers, conduit and outlets within the room.  The installation must include a "computer room kill switch" installation next to the server room door that will remove power from all UPS outlets in the event of an emergency.  The switch must be physically protected from accidental activation.  The NPS may specify the location of up to an additional five (5) UPS outlet locations during installation and should be addressed in the contractor's quote.  The project must include the complete and accurate labeling of all circuits and circuit breaker panels.   4.  PHASING/SCHEDULING OF WORK (PROPOSED):  The installation must be accomplished with a minimum of interruption of service.  To accomplish this, the following procedure will be followed:  1. The new distribution panel(s) and new 110 volt outlets will be installed and wired.  2. The existing system will be switched to bypass (moving the load directly to commercial power) and then the existing UPS can be disconnected.  3.  The new UPS system will be installed and wired, tested and activated.  The unused 110 volt outlets on the walls and the 110 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks that will transition to the new UPS can be moved to the new panel at this time.  The unused 220 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks may be rewired as 110 volt at this time (one will be relocated two (2) feet at this time).  4.  Equipment with redundant power supplies will be moved (hot) from the old outlets to the new UPS outlets during normal business hours.  5.  The switchover of any equipment that is both critical and does not have redundant power supplies as well as the 220 volt ESN equipment will be scheduled after 6:00 PM in coordination with NPS IT Personnel.  6. Distribution rooms on each of the floors can be switched from their current panel to the new UPS panel during normal business hours.  7. The bypass switch, the old single phase panel, the abandoned 110 volt outlets and all associated conduit can be removed at the end of this work schedule.  NOTE:  The NPS is open to a different sequencing proposal which constitutes an improvement over the above description without increasing the length of disruption in service.   5.  SCHEDULED SITE VISIT:  There is a scheduled site visit set for September 12, 2006 starting at 1:00 PM local time.  Interested vendors should meet NPS personnel in the lobby of the NPS Alaska Regional Office at 240 W.  5th Ave., Anchorage, AK 99501 at 1:00 PM where they will be escorted as a group into the area where work is to be preformed.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (SECURUS) under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 0800 MST Tuesday, 19 Sep 06 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement:

This requirement is for non-personal services to relocate existing Spacesaver Mechanical Assist Mobile Storage System from the second floor of the Federal Building, 1520 Willamette Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO to Room 101 Building 1470, Peterson AFB, CO and installation of additional compatible Spacesaver Mechanical Assist Mobile Storage System to be joined to the system being relocated.   The shelving will be added to existing Spacesaver mobile shelving and requires identical/compatible shelving units to expand storage capabilities.  The sole source vendor is the vendor that installed the original Spacesaver equipment in the Federal Building. This company designed the system and is the only company knowledgeable of installation and familiar with the components that make up this storage system. The complexity of the Spacesaver shelving system requires in-depth familiarization with the system to successfully move and reinstall the equipment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

<DESC>This notice serves as Modification No. 01 to BAA05-45.  The purpose of this modification is to extend the open period of the BAA through 19 December 2006.  Additionally, the BAA05-45 Proposer Information Package (PIP) has been updated (dtd 16 September 2006).  Accordingly, the original BAA05-45 notice is amended to read as follows:    

Information Exploitation Technology, SOL BAA 05-45, Abstracts and Proposals Due: Anytime between 19 September 2005 and 19 December 2006; Technical POC: Dr. Robert Tenney, Director, DARPA/IXO; Phone (703) 696-2298.

BACKGROUND:  DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of enabling technology, critical subsystems, and full system concepts that will provide revolutionary improvement to the efficiency and effectiveness of military Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, strike and stability operations in complex battlespaces.  The goal of this procurement is to identify and develop novel ideas for sensing, signal processing, target characterization, data fusion, target tracking, predictive awareness, battle management, collaborative planning, and visualization that can contribute to future conflict mitigation, warfighting and peacekeeping effectiveness.  Ideas can address 1) ways to employ new scientific/technical developments to achieve significant increases in component performance; 2) novel combinations of existing technologies into systems that create new warfighting capabilities; or 3) combinations of both.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  As a DARPA systems-oriented office, IXO is interested in both system applications and enabling technologies.  IXO?s application areas span the full range of anticipated DoD missions, from 1) influencing of potential adversary actions to avoid conflict to 2) shaping the battlespace before conflict to 3) improving the effectiveness of major combat operations to 4) providing force multipliers for post-conflict reconstruction and stability operations.  In each of these mission areas, IXO focuses on automating and accelerating the processes necessary to lift the fog of war, understand the adversary, and increase the pace of battle.  Meeting these objectives requires a diverse set of technologies, that when placed in a system context, can provide significant advances in DoD capability.  IXO is interested in proposals that combine emerging technologies with high-payoff system applications.  Proposals that address any combination of technology and application that fall within IXO?s broad mission objectives may be submitted under this BAA.

TECHNOLOGIES OF INTEREST:  Technologies that interest IXO include but are not limited to: 1) Sensors, 2) Sensor Processing, 3) Environmental Discovery, 4) Target Discrimination, 5) Tracking, 6) Information Fusion, 7) Signature Discovery, 8) Context Analysis, 9) Network Analysis, 10) Game Theory, 11) Modeling, 12) Computational Social Science, 13) Emergent Behavior Exploitation, 14) Ad Hoc Networking, 15) Control Methods, (16) Planning, 17) Autonomy, 18) Platforms, 19) Robotics, 20) Observables Management, 21) Very Large Databases, 22) Processors, 23) Displays, 24) Mission-specific Communication Links, and 25) Human-computer Interaction.

SYSTEM APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST:  High payoff system applications that interest IXO include but are not limited to: 1) Rapidly Defeating Elusive Surface Targets, 2) Understanding of the Urban Battlespace, 3) Understanding the 21st Century Battlespace, 4) Managing the Scale and Complexity of the Network-centric Battlespace, 5) Combat ID of Individuals, 6) Getting Situation Data Into the Head of the Busy Warfighter, 7) Obtaining Reliable Forensics in Cluttered Environments, and 8) Knowing What is Over the Hill / Around the Corner / Behind the Wall.  Further details on specific technology and application interest, program phases, selection criteria, and submission instructions may be found in the Proposer?s Information Package (PIP) which can be accessed at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm.

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 05-45.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be sent to BAA05-45 @darpa.mil. Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for public access.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit abstracts in advance of full proposals.  DARPA will employ an electronic upload process for abstract/proposal submissions for BAA 05-45.  Performers may find guidance for abstract/proposal submission in the PIP at: http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm.  This BAA will remain open from 19 September 2005 through 19 December 2006.  Throughout this period, DARPA will receive and review abstracts and/or proposals on a continuous basis and proposers are encouraged to submit innovative abstracts and/or proposals at any time during this period.  Please reference http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/IXT/index.htm for complete submission instructions.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCUs and MIs participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.  Government contractors are required to register at the Government?s Central Contractor Registration site in order to negotiate contracts with most government agencies.  This URL is provided as a reference: http://www.ccr.gov.  Since this FedBizOpps Announcement, along with the PIP, constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated in the FAR 6.102 (d)(2)(i), all prospective Proposers MUST also refer to the PIP before submitting a proposal.  Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  Original Point of Contact: Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (517) 218-4804, Fax (703) 807-4940, Email mblackstone@darpa.mil.

The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is currently in the process of revising the Standard Review Plan (SRP) (NUREG-0800) in anticipation of the receipt of multiple combined operation license (COL) applications starting in 2007.  The SRP sections refer to Regulatory Guides (RGs), some of which have not been updated in decades.  NRC is working to commonly prioritize and align the RGs based on the anticipated need for updated versions to be consistent with the revised SRP and support COL application development and staff review.

The objective of this acquisition is to acquire technical support for the review, prioritization and revision, as needed, of 418 RGS.  Specific tasks will be defined through the issuance of individual Task Orders.  In general, the contractor shall ? (1) review/identify/prioritize the RGs which will include reviewing each RG against current regulations, draft or proposed regulations, and state-of-the-art methods and information to identify appropriate revisions and then providing NRC with a prioritized list of the RGs which need revision; and (2) provide the technical support for revising the RGs which will include evaluating existing technical information to support the RG revision, making presentations (e.g., public meetings, Advisory committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), and the Committee to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR)), responding to comments/questions (e.g., from the public, ACRS, and CRGR) and providing adequate documentation to support the revision of the RGs.

NRC intends to award a task order contract.  The period of performance is 36 months with one (1) one-year option period.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about July 31, 2006.  The RFP will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov and any future solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions.  Hard copies of the RFP document and its related documents, as appropriate will be posted at this website, therefore, telephonic and written requests for hard copies of the RFP will not be honored.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  The government will not reimburse interested parties for any costs associated with responding to this solicitation.  The size standard for this acquisition is an average of $6 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS code 541690.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns (i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals).  Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirement of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.  Thus, all large businesses must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.  All businesses, large and small, interested in teaming arrangements, should send their business information (i.e., organization name, address, size of business, contact name and phone number) to the NRC Contract Specialist listed at the end of this notice.  The NRC will post this information in a Teaming Opportunities list with the solicitation.  In order to allow the Contract Specialist time to finalize the list and post it at the same time the solicitation is posted, all business information shall be received no later than July 27, 2006.  All parties are advised that this list is not representative of all sources that may have an interest in the solicitation, which is available on the FedBizOpps website.

The Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for Vertical Unmanned Aircraft System 
(VUAS), 4 October, 2005, established a requirement for a VUAS as a follow-on to the Pioneer Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) System. As a top level summary of system capabilities, the air vehicle should be capable of:
a)	operations from austere sites and all air capable ships
b)	carrying a Modular Mission Payload  with the ability to search, detect, locate, track, classify, and designate
c)	the necessary combination of speed, range and endurance to participate in missions with current and future USMC air assets (V-22, JSF, etc.)
d)	speed to reduce transit time and cover more area during a set time aloft
e)	a minimum of 10 days system persistence to support MEU missions at a range of 110 nm from the Seabase and a minimum of 30 days of persistence is required for MEB level missions at a range of 110 nm
f)	inter/intra theater transportation of all components of the VUAV system on a  KC-130 (as per USMC Vertical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Concept of Operations)
g)	surviving in a high threat environment by possessing low visual, infrared and acoustic signatures, and a reduced Radar Cross Section (RCS)
 
This abbreviated list of required system capabilities is for preliminary screening; a more comprehensive list of required attributes is available in the ICD and documents referenced therein. The VUAS will also be capable of supporting Marine Corps Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) and Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM). The VUAS system will comprise fully integrated components, including: air vehicle, modular and interchangeable payloads, Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) interface systems, ground control systems, launch and recover equipment, and automatic take-off and landing subsystems. The VUAS will be expected to successfully operate within the mobility and transportability constraints of the Marine Corps.

The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air Programs (DASN (AIR)) and Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) are sponsoring an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). To support the AoA the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is conducting a market survey to obtain industry input relative to its capabilities to satisfy the Marine Corps Vertical Unmanned Aerial System requirements documented in the ICD. We desire any information on capabilities and performance of the respondent's system/air vehicle as it relates to the capabilities given in the ICD and consistent with the VUAS having an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) as early as FY15. This data will be used in the AoA. 

Please include in your response information addressing: 
(1) development status of the aircraft design and of major subsystems and components, expressed as Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and any other applicable measure; (2) production status of major subsystems and components; (3) availability of design and support documentation, such as specifications of major subsystems and components; (4) all data links used, including discussion of net-ready and joint interoperability capabilities; (5) sensor payloads, payload capability, weapons load out and payload growth capacity (weight and power); (6) concepts for system load out on a C130, CH-53 and other intra-theater Marine Corps transport; (7) growth paths for any performance area that does not meet the requirements including ability to spiral to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) capabilities. 

Also requested are estimated costs, to include but not necessarily be limited to: (8) Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and production costs, for the entire system broken out by costs for (9) an air vehicle with an electro-optical/infrared/laser designator modular payload and a communication relay pent to support the various missions and will be based upon the speed and distance required to arrive on station.  A time on-station of 4.0 hrs at 200 nm is envisioned.  During operations, the system must have the ability to be retasked either while airborne or, after a short redirection period on the ground to refit its payload and/or refuel.  The system should be designed to provide maximum agility and the ability to respond to meet the parameters of a six hour planning cycle.  The system must be easily transportable in theater by organic MAGTF aircraft, thereby possessing some degree of self-deployability and not rely on strategic lift to relocate once in theater.  The system must be all-weather capable to include operations in day/night, and adverse weather (rain, salt spray, fog, dust, transient icing and temperature extremes). 

The system should strive to use common ?plug and play? modular payloads and a common ground station that can easily integrate and be interoperable with other current joint or future systems that will be employed by the JTF in the 2015 timeframe.  Information obtained from the system must be readily distributed through the network to various supported units.  The information must be relevant to the user and in a format useful to the requestor.

(3) Notional Performance: 

The Navy intends to pursue an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Proposed for increment one is a reliable and ship-deployable UAS that provides a baseline electro-optical / infrared, and radio communications capability.  The initial mission areas envisioned for the first increment are as follows:

- 	Timely Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance 
-    Target acquisition, identification, and designation
-    Airborne (beyond line of sight) communications relay service of voice, data and imagery

Additional future Modular Mission Payload (MMP) sensors and aircraft systems to support mission requirements could include: 

-    Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT)  
- 	Intelligence data (Order of Battle) and Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield refresh and support
- 	Screen areas beyond and/or adjacent to JTF/MAGTF objectives
- 	Indication and warning of weapons of mass destruction employment
- 	Detached escort to screen rotary wing and fixed wing missions
- 	Surface-to-air missiles (SAM)/anti-aircraft artillery indication and warning 
- 	Information to complete final coordination on objectives and targets
- 	Precision-guided munitions and sub munitions delivery
- 	Battle Damage Assessment (BDA)
- 	Anti-air warfare capability
- 	Very shallow water mine and beach obstacle detection

<DESC>Amendment 1 to Solicitation Reference Number-0010187687 is issued to:

Provide additional VUAS data and descriptions.  The government will not release the Vertical Unmanned Aircraft System (VUAS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) or Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  VUAS performance requirements provided in the original RFI and data requested of industry remain unchanged.

(2)	Extend deadline for submission of requested data to close of business October 17, 2006.

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal, and it is not a commitment by the Department of the Navy to procure products or services.  All questions pertaining to this notice should be submitted in writing to Mr. Joseph Pestar, Contract Specialist, Email joseph.pester@navy.mil or Ms. Jessica McGee, Contracting Officer, Email jessica.mcgee@navy.mil.

In accordance with the Vertical Unmanned Aircraft System (VUAS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that established a requirement for a VUAS as a follow-on to the Pioneer Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) System, the Department of the Navy is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to determine VUAS performance capability requirements.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain current industry data on systems / air vehicles capable of meeting or exceeding Marine Corps VUAS capabilities required to support Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) and Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM).  To assist industry in providing the necessary detail for the Marine Corps to evaluate current technology, outlined below are VUAS (1) key considerations, (2) operating concepts, and 3) Notional Performance.  

 (1) Key Considerations:

2015 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) to replace the current Marine Corps tactical UAS
Responsive and persistent ISR, providing targeting products to the maneuver element commander, and serving as a communications relay
Seamless integration into a network-centric C2 environment
Shipboard compatibility and scalability to allow deployment with all levels of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)

(2) Operating Concepts: 

The VUAS concept is closely linked to MV-22 and the F-35B JSF operations, and will require speeds and ranges to support these aircraft. The minimum speed required would be 200 kts, but 240 kts would be preferred. The VUAS must be expeditionary, i.e., operate simultaneously with other organic MAGTF aircraft from all air-capable ships and operate from austere, forward operating locations with minimal personnel and logistics footprint.  The system must be highly survivable, using passive measures to the greatest degree possible to reduce system signature, and low visual, infrared and acoustic signatures, and reduced Radar Cross Section (RCS) to operate in a high threat environment. The VUAS will have a reduced physical footprint and require no more than, or fewer, personnel to operate the system compared to current systems.  With reduced manpower to maintain and operate the system, it must have a high degree of automation and reliability to successfully support continuous operations by a scalable JTF/MAGTF.  The entire VUAS system must be scalable to support MAGTF operations from the relatively small Special Purpose MAGTF level to the larger, reinforced Marine Expeditionary Force, be capable of supporting any Joint Task Force (JTF) to which a MAGTF is attached, and operate as a detachment without the loss of functionality or capability.  The system must be capable of reaching ranges to provide Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP), target acquisition/designation and battle damage assessment for the F-35B and other strike platforms.   

The system must have sufficient air vehicle endurance to support EMW / STOM operations necessary for future Seabased / Joint Forcible Entry Operations, with 10 days continuous airborne coverage at a range of 100 nm from the seabase.  Time on station must be sufficiackage as well as the ability to interchange these with future payloads such as Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and radar based reconnaissance capabilities, Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); (10) the Electro-Optical/Infrared/Laser (EO/IR/LD) designator modular payload itself, including integration costs, (11) any Ground Control Station (GCS) costs and (12) Software Lines Of Code (SLOC) counts and costs associated with the air vehicle and the payload. Some examples of possible cost categories for the Air Vehicle are: airframe, engine, communications suite, avionics, and landing gear; however, the response should use categories most appropriate for the specific system and (13) test program requirements and costs broken out by flight tests and ground based testing, and (14) System Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) equivalent head counts and costs.

The response should include the following air vehicle (AV) specific data: (15) AV structural design data including minimum and maximum load factors at design gross weight, (16) six-view drawings or Computer Aided Design (CAD) models (unfolded and folded as applicable; Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format preferred), internal arrangement drawings, and geometric data on all components; (17) performance data (such as Take-off Gross Weight/endurance as a function of speed and altitude at Sea Level/Standard Day (ISA) and 3000?/91.5? conditions; Payload-Range curves, Time on Station vs. Radius of Action graphs)  (18) drag estimate listed by component and drag polars, (19) Group Weight Statement, (20) engine data including engine type, Shaft Horse Power (SHP) (or thrust), Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), fuel type, fuel flow at different power settings/altitudes/atmospheric conditions (Sea Level/ISA & 3K/91.5?)/velocities, (21) design mission and design constraints used for designing the Air Vehicle (if applicable), (22) data on RF, IR, visual and acoustic signatures on the AV system and any existing data on survivability and/or vulnerability against potential threat systems, and (23) the ability to spiral to carry future payloads such as SIGINT, IMINT, MASINT, and radar based reconnaissance capabilities, such as GMTI and SAR. 

The response should include the following EO/IR/LD sensor data: (24) Instantaneous Fields of View (IFOV); (25) Fields of View (FOV); (26) Fields of Regard (FOR) given as azimuth, elevation, and slew rate; (27) pixel count for all resolutions; (28) ground resolution as a function of altitude/slant range; (29) detection sensitivity and ability to detect selected targets as a function of altitude/slant range for a standard day weather for each FOV; (30) any detection sensitivity data available for specific ground battlefield targets such as tanks or trucks as a function of altitude/slant range and humidity, weather, and battle field obscurants for each FOV. 

The response should include the following ground control station data: (31) compatibility with the Pioneer Replacement Ground Control System (RGCS)/Army ?One System? GCS/planned GCS that will operate USMC UAS as part of its Family of Systems concept, and (32) open architecture capabilities. 

Information in your response should also address logistics support requirements: (33) maintenance to include inspections and servicing, and the recommended maintenance concept; (34) reliability and maintainability (R&M) data; (35) Training, (36) Manpower; (37) Support Equipment; (38) hardware, and computer resources; (39) Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation (PHS&T); (40) Facilities, and (41) Supply, to include obsolescence mitigation. 

The VUAS must be capable of takeoff and landing from all air capable ships. Provide data, if available, on: (42) launch and recovery and the method to securely retain the VUAS before takeoff and after touchdown, (43) a method of automatically transitioning from a takeoff point to a marshalling point and from a marshalling point to touchdown relative to the ship, (44) interfaces to, or compatibility with, existing Naval C4I systems and future Marine Corps Command and Control nodes, and (45) the Air Vehicle?s ability to be ship suitable and survive in a maritime environment (aircraft control power to accommodate operations on a pitching and moving deck, aircraft folding (if required), tie-down points, corrosion resistant features, tolerance of shipboard electromagnetic environment, etc). 

System maturity, as evidenced by demonstrated performance and flight data of 
major subsystems and components from off-the-shelf systems/air vehicles is highly 
preferable; lengthy development alternatives are not desired. Responding parties 
should submit a written statement of interest along with the above requested 
supporting unclassified data, and POC to contact for any necessary clarification or 
additional data required by the analysis and information on any necessary non-

The Government also reserves the right to limit awards to one contract award per industry sector (for example: trade finance or international shipping and logistics). 
Because this solicitation may result in multiple awards and partnerships of differing natures, selected partners may be incorporated into selected CS programs at anytime following selection, subject to considerations such as the value of partner's offerings to CS customers and clients, ease and cost of integration, compatibility of partner's offerings with CS capabilities and brand, and others. Detailed plans and timelines will be agreed upon mutually between the CS and each selected partner. 
The Government reserves the right to decline proposals from entities that currently have contracts or agreements in areas that potentially overlap with the subject of this RFQ, (e.g. agreements for U.S. export promotion facilitation, including exporter referral and matching services and U.S. exporter databases) as these would present prohibited conflicts of interest.  Where any contract is awarded and a conflict of interest is discovered, the Government reserves the right in its discretion to terminate any contract at any time.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THE MODIFICATION IS TO MAKE A MINOR REVISION IN THE NOTICE'S INTRODUCTION AND TO MAKE MINOR REVISIONS TO THE REQUIREMENTS SECTION OF THE NOTICE.  THE DUE DATE FOR THE SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THE NOTICE REMAINS UNCHANGED:


The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), seeks to identify potential sources that are capable of performing the continued implementation and operation of the Total Asset Visibility (TAV) logistics system.  A contract, with STRATIX Corporation, 4920 Avalon Ridge Parkway, Norcross, Georgia 30071-1572, was awarded for the delivery of Phase I of the TAV system.  DESCRIPTION:  The TAV logistics system is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) system that consists of three principal components, namely the Warehouse Management (WM) module, the Trading Partner Management (TPM) module, and the Orbitrax GPS tracking module.  The WM module handles all inventory functions within the FEMA logistic centers (warehouses) in Atlanta, Georgia and Fort Worth, Texas.  The Trading Partner Management (TPM) module handles shipping of all commodities and assets among locations within Region IV and VI.  TPM is used by FEMA logistics managers to identify commodities stored at the various logistic centers that are to be distributed to State and local authorities and disaster victims.  Orders are prepared in TPM and sent to logistic centers in WM where the stock is pulled from the warehouse, prepared, and shipped to the specified locations.  In the near future, FEMA logistics managers will also use TPM to place orders with commercial entities and other Federal Agencies for goods and materials to replenish the stock of the logistic centers.  The Orbitrax GPS tracking module, provided by OrbitOne, is a one-way satellite transmitter affixed to trailers carrying disaster commodities from the logistic centers to the disaster theater.  The WM and TPM modules are provided by Manhattan Associates.  The WM module consists of multiple Linux Red Hat and Windows 2003 servers that host the application, web user interface, integration, and Oracle database.  Within the FEMA logistics centers the WM application is accessed over wireless handheld scanning devices.  Tablet PCs run on the Microsoft Windows XP operating system and the wireless handheld scanners run on the Microsoft Pocket PC operating system.  Access security for the wireless warehouse devices is provided by Air Fortress software from Fortress Technologies.  The TPM application resides on servers running Microsoft 2003, IIS web server, and SQL server technologies.  TPM is accessed through the Internet using Microsoft Internet Explorer thin client and/or using VPN technology using iPass virtual private network software from iPass Inc. and Black Ice from Internet Security Systems Inc. for firewall protection.  Some of the commercial entities and Federal Agencies access TPM through the Internet after being granted access by FEMA.  Others are granted access to the system via broadband communication through the Internet using virtual private network (VPN) technology. The two applications, WM and TPM, exchange data through a secure FTP process using secure shell technology from Vandyke Software.  The tracking data from the Orbitrax system is accessed through TPM.  The serial number for an individual Orbitrax unit is tied to the shipment documentation in TPM; clicking on the serial number in TPM directs a user to the OrbitOne website where the shipment's geographic location can be viewed.  REQUIREMENTS:  The successful offeror must be able to continue the implementation, operation, support, and expansion of the TAV system.  Requirements to accomplish this include: (1) Maintenance of system hardware, including handheld readers and tablet computers; (2) Maintenance of GPS tracking devices provided by OrbitOne; (3) Maintenance and support of system software provided by Manhattan Associates; (4) The expansion of the WM and TPM modules.  FEMA currently owns sub-modules within WM and TPM that have not been activated; (5) The inclusion of additional Manhattan modules, as required; (6) The expansion of the TAV system to new locations, as required.  These locations may include additional FEMA logistic centers, other Federal partners, or vendor partners; (7) The ability to surge support staff in response to a disaster.  At a minimum, the contractor must have the capability to surge up to 200 people within a 4 hour notice for a period of at least 3 months to support disaster response.  These people may be deployed to both headquarters and field locations.  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS: Contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. Foreign and domestic suppliers will be considered equally. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice should be limited to 25 pages or less and include supporting materials that allows for an effective evaluation of your company's/team?s competence, experience, and overall understanding of the scope of work that FEMA has identified. Submissions should include company history, company size, major products, primary customer base, points of contacts (able to discuss the submitted materials), and a description of past experience.  Contractors are to provide evidence of how they intend to be responsive to the urgent and short lead-time requirements.  Responses to this Sources Sought Notice are hereby requested by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), on 20 September 2006 to support the Government's milestone objectives.  Information should be e-mailed to Aaron H. Ford, Contracting Officer at both Aaron.Ford@associates.dhs.gov and Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov.  Questions can be submitted electronically to both Aaron.Ford@associates.dhs.gov and Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov .  Information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider. All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-Aircrew-Helmet-Noise-Reduction-(AHNR)
<CONTACT>Carol Estes, Contracting Officer, Phone 210-536-2068, Fax 210-536-4563, Email carol.estes@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for an Aircrew Helmet Noise Reduction (AHNR) system designed to integrate with the HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P flight helmets.  Responses to this RFI are due no later than 29 Sept 2006.

1.0 DESCRIPTION:  The 648 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS), is seeking feedback on the draft performance specification for AHNR, which may be obtained from Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) (https://www.fedteds.gov/).  The AHNR is an integrated helmet noise reduction system, which will effectively reduce noise in all phases of flight in multiple platforms and crew positions which require use of the Air Force HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P helmets.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

- Feasibility assessment and comment on Draft Performance Specification
- Approximate cost information (i.e. order of magnitude, ballpark estimate, etc.) for development and testing efforts needed to meet Draft Performance Specification requirements
- Schedule estimates (development, test, and production capacities)
- Comments on additional technical questions contained in section 3.0 of this RFI
- Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing the AHNR system

2.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to open a dialogue with industry and other communities of interest, to ensure to the maximum extent possible that industry input and comments are given proper and due consideration in development of the Air Force AHNR.  The RFI is also expected to help 648 AESS/TA to complete indicative costing of the AHNR solution.

This RFI is for planning purposes only, and there is no intention to award any contract based on this RFI.  The Government will not compensate any interested party, firm, or individual that may choose to provide a response to this RFI.  An appropriate Request for Proposal (RFP) process may follow at the appropriate time, but is not necessarily linked directly to the questions and responses generated in this RFI.

3.0 CAPABILITIES SOUGHT

The topics for responses set out the information on concepts and designs that 648 AESS/TA is seeking in relation to the AHNR approach and scope of this RFI.  Generated requirements are listed in the referenced Draft Performance Specification document.  Note that these requirements are in Draft only; these capabilities are not necessarily guaranteed to be required in the final Performance Specification.

This section lists additional Government questions/comments on capabilities found in the Draft Performance Specification, or related questions to the AHNR program.  Industry should address the feasibility of the requirements in the Draft Performance Specification, answer questions about the specific requirements called out below, as well as respond to the informational questions with comments and potential solutions.

Please address the requirements of section 3 in the Draft Performance Specification from a feasibility standpoint.  Are these requirements able to be met with current technology, or would there have to be a significant development effort for some of the features we are seeking?  If there are major development efforts, please note these and give approximate costs and schedules to achieve this development.

How would you measure bulk for this system?  What would be a realistic number for total system weight and head supported weight?  What would you suggest the testing matrix in section 4 look like, and when should these tests be preformed (FAT, Production Lot, etc.)?  What quantities are realistic when it comes to lot testing this type of item?  Would this add significant costs and testing to the development of the AHNR?

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those capabilities specified in the referenced Draft Performance Specification.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0 RESPONSE GUIDANCE

Respondents to this RFI should submit documents via email to both of the POCs listed in section 7.0 of this RFI.  In the response, please reference specific sections in the Draft Performance Specification by number, with the comments and evaluation of that particular section following.  In addition, please address the questions outside of the Draft Performance Specification in section 3.0 of this RFI, and provide responses following the analysis of the Draft Performance Specification.  Submitted responses should be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format.

5.0 INFORMATION APPROACH

When the responses to this RFI are received, they will be evaluated and analyzed by the Government.  The information received will be considered in the development of the next proposed design, and may serve as input to a business case.

Based on industry responses, 648 AESS/TA intends to modify/update the Performance Specification document as necessary.  In all cases pertaining to this RFI, the Government will take absolute care not to present information outside of the Government in a way that clearly identifies individual vendors or products.

6.0 DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.210 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The General Service Administration Federal Technology Service (GSA/FTS) intends to award a sole source Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern (SDVOSB) firm fixed price contract for Compliance Guardian (CG) 2007 Suite Software and installation services to N2N Tech Solutions, LLC.  CG software mimics the capabilities of the Medical Education and Personnel System (MEPS) which is being phased out of the Army inventory. Features include the ability to:  1) track personnel, education and incident reporting at William Beaumont Army Medical Center (WBAMC) using information currently stored in many WBAMC?s databases and applications; 2) provide the medical treatment facility (MTF) with all personnel demographics, personnel training and readiness, and JCAHO-centric aggregate clinical quality data; 3) run on a Microsoft SQL server for a relational database management system;  4) be the demographic cornerstone of a multiplicity of administrative, clinical, and educational systems interfaced to provide medical treatment facilities (MTFs) with a single, modern, web-enabled client; and;  5) interfaces with existing US Army systems and use sophisticated data replication and distribution techniques to aggregate date at the headquarters level; 6) mimic the capabilities of the MEPS system and provide central MEPS the data needed while allowing WBAMC to keep unique training and reporting capabilities currently under MEPS. CG suites are a SQL based applications and are built around the Microsoft Share Point services that offer Military Treatment Facility (MTF) to meet the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) standards for maintaining and reporting mandatory hospital education and readiness training.  N2N is believed to be the only source for this software. Any SDVOSB other than N2N, who can provide the above software must indicate their interest and capability no later 22 September 2006, 4:00 (central) to Joe Eason, joe.eason@gsa.gov or Pat Molina, patricia.molina@gsa.gov.

A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The following specification applies to the DC-7 parachute requirement: The parachute canopy shall be 375 square feet to accommodate a payload ranging from 220-300 pounds and be capable of reaching at least 20 miles per hour forward speed.  The parachute shall be capable of achieving descent rates of 0-10 feet per second in no wind conditions using a static deep brake setting. Slotted stabilizer bars are required for good slow speed performance and stability.  A span wise constructed seam is required in order to fit a canopy of this size into the required development bags and containers. The color scheme shall be as follows: (a) Top Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the second span of fabric shall be white, the third span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (b) Bottom Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the 2nd span of fabric shall be fire red, the 3rd span of fabric shall be white, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 5th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (c) End cells shall be fire red; (d) Ribs shall be fire red; (e) Stabilizers shall be fire red; (f) Slider shall be fire red. The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $75,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 314999 and PSC code 1670 apply. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #RAP062217.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by September 18, 2006 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Para-Flite, Inc. for the requirements stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Patrick Lorton at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<SUBJECT>54 -- Alaska Small Structure
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This agency intends to award to Alaska Structures, Inc., 9024 Vanguard Dr., Ste 101, Anchorage, AK 99507.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.

JCSE requires a product that is compatible with all the assets currently in stock, with Joint Operation Stock assets, and Harvest Falcon equipment.  It is not feasible to have mismatched tents in deployable locations.

Market research was conducted and only one company makes the Alaskan Shelters that match all the other deployed shelters.  It is imperative that all shelters blend in with the demographics of the surrounding area.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AUTHORITY:
The supplier was chosen because they are the only ones that make the product we need.  We cannot use a different product because the Alaska Structures Shelter is the only tent we have found to be compatible with all of our assets, Joint Operation Stock assets and Harvest Falcon equipment.  The U.S. Air Force has converted to the Alaskan Small Shelter System and use of any other tent would require us to make costly alterations to our equipment.  It is imperative that all of our shelters blend in with the demographics of the surrounding area.

** Funds are not presently available for this purchase.  The Government?s obligation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available and an order is issued, in writing, by the Contracting Officer.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers and ProLiant ML570 G3 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server and HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with optimal server configurations to meet CA/CST/VCS’ Immigrant Visa Allocation Management System (IVAMS) and Diversity Immigrant Visa Information System (DVIS) projects needs.  Currently CA is upgrading the OS and Oracle in preparation for the next releases of DVIS 05.03.00 and IVAMS 06.00.00; therefore, this is an opportune time to refresh the DVIS and IVAMS server environments with the new servers.  The HP DL380 G5 server and the HP ML570 G3 meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health. ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks. ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives. ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers. ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting. ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives. ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports. ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources. ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL BRAND NAME $2500 TO $100,000 PART I: JUSTIFICATION 1. Requiring Activity:  60th Services Squadron- Fitness Center (1.) Description of Acquisition /Requirement:  The Cybex Total Body ?Arc Trainer is a cardiovascular/cross trainer exercise machine that we do not offer at the Fitness Center.  (2.) Statutory Authority:  10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible brand and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The Fitness Center does not currently have Cybex cardio cross trainers installed in the facility. (3.) Justification or Authority for action: The Cybex Arc Trainer machine is compatible to our twenty five existing strength and cardio Cybex line of equipment. There is an increasing number of active duty military personnel failing their Air Force PT test and are in need of a piece of cardio equipment that will effectively monitor heart ranges. The Arc trainer has a built in heart rate receiver and contact heart rate so they can easily monitor their maximum heart range. Active duty must record the length of time in their heart rage on their AF form 1975. This feature is crucial for those in the mandatory wing Fit Camp. Additional equipment is needed to fulfill the increasing demand for cardio machines during Fit Camp sessions. The Arc trainer features a gliding motion with very little hip and knee movement, to a high stepping range of motion with no impact. This non impact feature causes less stress on joints and less impact. This feature is unique to the Arc trainer and is essential for the active duty personnel who are on medical profiles but must participate in mandatory physical training. This machine allows them to exercise in their heart rate zone but at a safe range of motion and with no impact to their joints. (4.) Market Survey/Other Facts/Reason for Approval: It is our hope that by offering this equipment it will help individuals improve their level of fitness and receive a passing score on the Air Force Fitness Test. Additionally, this is the only brand of cross trainer that offers a gentle gliding motion and low workload for beginners to higher inclines for the most physically fit individual. It uniquely has a broad range of resistance from zero to 900 watts of resistance available in one hundred different intensity levels. Offering a piece of equipment with such versatility will be sure to increase the fitness levels of all military personnel to be Fit to Fight. This is crucial in preparing our troops to be physically fit to fight the world on terror and be physical prepared to deployable at a moments notice. (5.) Sources:  No additional sources, this is a one time acquisition. (6.) Steps to Improve Competition: No action will be taken to seek additional contractors because Cybex is the only brand that will meet the requirement of the fitness program.  The following provisions and/or clauses apply to this acquisition.  Offerors must comply with all instructions contained in FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial.

SPECIFICATIONS:

BI-DIRECTIONAL TAPERED BLADE AIRPORT SNOW PLOW

GENERAL:

These specifications describe a tapered blade snowplow capable of rotating in excess of 180 degrees, to discharge snow to the right or to the left.  This plow shall be ruggedly built from new material and definitely suited for extremely hard work under difficult conditions of high-speed snow removal.

MOLDBOARD:

The moldboard shall be not less than 16 feet long overall and not less than 12 feet X 6 inches long at each cutting edge (including nose shoe) and at least 18 inches high at the front end and 72 inches high at the discharge end of the moldboard.  The width of the path cleared shall be 10 ft. at the ground line.

The moldboard shall be not less than 10 USS gauge steel, paneled for additional rigidity, supported by five- (5) vertical and two (2) horizontal reinforcements.  The driving thrust shall be transmitted by a formed sheet metal structure welded to reinforcing flanges, which are welded to the moldboard sheet and to its horizontal reinforcements in such a manner as to distribute the load uniformly.  The driving thrust shall also be transmitted from the drive bars to the cutting edge reinforcement externally by means of two (2) 3/8 inches plate formed tee bars. There shall be an adjustable drive bar assembly of 4 inches x 4  inches x 1/2 inch angle irons to connect the plow to the truck push frame. Adjustable steady bars shall be provided for regulating the angle of the cutting edge with the ground.

PLOW ROTATING MECHANISM:

The plow moldboard shall be symmetrical about a longitudinal centerline and shall be provided with a planetary gear drive powered rotating mechanism operated by two 3.5 inches diameter by 12 inches stroke double acting hydraulic cylinders. The planetary gear set shall have replaceable bushings with grease points and the gears shall be 1.375 inches thick at the tooth interface. The components of the rotation mechanism shall be capable of being disassembled and replaced with normal mechanics tools. This rotating mechanism shall be capable of rotating the plow from right to left-hand discharge in a time not to exceed 13 seconds, while the truck is in motion.  The reversing cylinders shall have nitrided cylinder rods and shall be capable of being easily rebuilt.

CUTTING EDGES AND SHOES:

The moldboard shall be equipped with two (2) 1/2 inches x 8 inches abrasive resistant steel (C1090 or equal) reversible cutting edges, which attach with 5/8 inch carriage bolts to two (2) 6 inches x 4 inches x 1/2 inch cutting edge reinforcement angles. On the underside of each 
blade there shall be three replaceable wear shoes to prolong the life of the cutting edge.  Each shoe shall have a bearing surface of approximately 30 sq in, a wear surface hardness of at least 550 Brinell and a core hardness of at least 450 Brinell. The moldboard wear shoes shall be held in place with four bolts each. A wear resisting steel nose shoe or runner shall be provided at the front end of each cutting edge, held in place with three fasteners. The angle of shear at the cutting edge shall be approximately 35 degrees. The blade angle in relation to the direction of travel shall be 55 degrees (35 degrees of sweepback).


WEIGHT:

The snowplow shall weigh approximately 4,050 pounds excluding a truck mounted push frame.

   (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

        (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

   (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
 
     Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
 
     Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

     (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
 
     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
 
        (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
 
        (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
 
     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
 
       Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
 
   (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
 
     (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
 
        (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
 
        (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
 
     (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4- year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
 
     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
 
   (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

This RFQ will result in a three-year, Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The guaranteed minimum order quantity resulting from this solicitation will be a  MOUT range configuration with a contract value of $1 Million. An award under this solicitation in no way obligates the Government to place any additional orders beyond this guaranteed minimum. Any subsequent Delivery Orders placed against this contract wi ll utilize firm-fixed prices based on the unit prices provided by the successful awardee for relevant items within the corresponding ordering period(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. CAUT ION: This synopsis/solicitation is posted electronically to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website at http://www.fbo.gov under number W52H09-06-T-GRAF and any amendments will be issued electronically via the same website. The Government is under no obligation to maintain a respondent list and it is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access FedBizOps site to obtain any amendments which may be issued. This solicitation is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside, issued usi ng simplified acquisition procedures, pursuant to FAR Part 13, as authorized by the test program, at FAR part 13.500. FAR clause 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, Jun 2003 (15 U.S.C. 644) applies to this solicitation. FAR clauses 52.212-1 through 52.212-5 (and as modified herein) are incorporated by reference. Responses are requested for this solicitation, and will result in a three-year, IDIQ contract for reconfigurable MOUT ranges in Germany. Offerors are advised to propose their best pri ce and submit adequate and sufficient past performance information for evaluation, inclusive of all shoothouse structures, After Action Review (AAR) components, and 3-D targetry as described in the Statement of Work, Attachment 001 (hereafter SOW) and the Performance Description, Attachment 002 (hereafter PD), and depicted in the GTA MOUT drawings, Attachment 003 and Attachment 009 (MOUT Wall Assembly). All attachments can be found on TACOM-Rock Islands Solicitation Information Page, URL: https://aais.ria. army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/index.htm under Draft Solicitations/Specifications/Scopes of Work.). The successful offeror is responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses or permits required by law or statute. FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Com mercial Items (Jan 2006), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference with the following modifications: delete paragraph (h) and subsection (a) is tailored as follows: The NAICS code is 3329 and the small business size standard for this ac quisition is 500. FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition, modified as follows at subsection (a): The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quot e conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price and Past Performance. The Government will evaluate price based on the total eval uated price. The GTA MOUT Component Pricesheet (Attachment 004) consists of a two-page entry form for each ordering period. Ordering periods are as follows: ORDERING PERIOD 1, DATE OF AWARD  30 SEP 2007; ORDERING PERIOD 2, 01 OCTOBER 2007  30 SEP 2008; O RDERING PERIOD 3, 01 OCTOBER 2008  30 SEP 2009. The Government will apply an offerors pricing to a Notional Delivery Order (NDO) scenario for each ordering pe riod that may, in some form, be ordered by the Government after contract award. Total NDO prices for each ordering period will be added together to derive the total evaluated MOUT price. The NDOs used will be sample requirements consisting of some combina tion of the items priced on Attachment 004 that closely approximate the Governments actual initial requirements for reconfigurable MOUT ranges at GTA. Thus, while a Delivery Order may replicate an NDO used in evaluating offers, an NDO does not in itself r epresent a Delivery Order requirement. Past Performance will include relevant experience and general performance history. Relevant experience is production, installation, performance, and maintenance as they apply to MOUT range equipment, AAR components, a nd 3-D target devices. The more similar your experience is to the effort described in the SOW, the more relevant your experience will be deemed. Offerors, at a minimum, shall submit the Past Performance information outlined in Attachment 005 (Information f or Past Performance Evaluation). Articles 72 and 73 of the NATO SOFA (North American Treaty Organization Status of Forces Agreement) Supplementary Agreement between the United States and Germany also apply to this solicitation. In response to these governi ng documents, the Government does not anticipate the work involved by the successful offeror in performing installation of the MOUT range and the initial training of range personnel at GTA will exceed a period of 90 days or involve the work of TE (Technica l Expert) contractor personnel. However, offerors should reference Attachment 006 (Examples of TE and non-TE Positions) and notify the POC (Point of Contact) listed below immediately if they feel any TE staff would be required for the execution of any MOUT  range requirement to receive instructions on how to secure TESA (Technical Expert Status Accreditation) from the German Government. TESA procedures are considered a pre-award activity. If no TE personnel will be necessary IAW your proposal and you are the  successful offeror, TDY status can be secured for your staff through a process known as FAX-BACK. A FAX-BACK application will be provided to the successful offeror as an appendix to any award documentation. Attachment 007 (Explanation of German Fax-Back P rocess) provides an explanation of this process for reference. All hardware required for completion of subsequent Delivery Orders resulting from this solicitation shall be ready for shipment to Germany within a period NTE (Not to Exceed) 90 days from notif ication of award. A shorter delivery time is encouraged and is acceptable at no additional cost to the Government. Inspection and acceptance shall be IAW commercial practices, i.e. Certificate of Conformance (COC), FAR 52.246-15 applies. Final acceptance o f GTA MOUT ranges purchased via this solicitation will be IAW COC procedures and the final deliverable to be inspected/accepted will include all GTA MOUT structures, AAR components, and targets referenced in Attachments 001, 002, and 003, as they apply to the specific Delivery Order, fully installed by the selected vendor, as well as all initial training and training manuals called out in Section 6 of the SOW. FOB will be Origin with GBL (Government Bill of Lading). Offerors shall submit prices for the GTA MOUT range package components on the Price Evaluation Sheet (Attachment 004) as previously referenced. Attachment 008 (a copy of the Representations and Certifications at FAR 52.212-3) shall also be submitted. Attachments 004 and 008 are to be completed an d submitted with your offer, and failure to complete any sections of these documents may render the offer unacceptable and result in a rejection of the same.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Objectives: A. General: The Clinical Information Technology Program Office (CITPO) established a Terminology Service Bureau (TSB) to meet the terminology requirements of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA). The TSB is based on a central domain-onto logy called the Military Health System Core Ontology (MHSCO). With the deployment of AHLTA, there is a need to deal with the unstructured free text format of typed and dictated/transcribed notes in AHLTA.  Natural Language Processing (NLP), in combination with an ontology, is a technology proposed to extract meaningful data from the free text documents that can represent and manipulate meanings of texts.  As an example, ontologies can provide the difference in meaning for the word discharge, such as a discharge from the nose or a patient discharge from the hospital.  However in addition to the meanings of words, grammar and logic are necessary to combine the meanings into a complete semantic representation. For example the word discharge can be used as a noun, verb or an adjective in the following sentences: "	The patient's discharge was at 8 AM "	The physician planned to discharge the patient the next morning.  "	The nurse gave the patient discharge instructions.  Lexicons can provide the details of the grammatical structure of each word (morphology), its part of speech, and the meaning of the word in different textual contexts, e.g. depending on the word or punctuation mark before or after it. Traditional grammar c lassifies words based on eight parts of speech: the verb, the noun, the pronoun, the adjective, the adverb, the preposition, the conjunction, and the interjection. Each part of speech explains not what the word is, but how the word is used. The same word c an be a noun in one sentence and a verb or adjective in the next as seen the example of the word discharge above.    TATRC requires consultation from personnel who are recognized experts in clinical and linguistic ontologies within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP).  The MHSCO was originally created by Language and Computing, Inc., with a normalized versio n of SNOMED CT® that was used both as a Domain Ontology and as an external terminology.   The government seeks a vendor intimately familiar with Language and Computings ontologies to provide a white paper describing the advantages, benefits, approaches, a nd risks of approaches to adding natural language processing capability to the TSB Ontology B. Work Description:  The vendor shall provide personnel with demonstrated experience and ability to provide enterprise-wide technical management and direction for problem definition, analysis and requirements, development and implementation, for very complex systems in the su bject matter area. The vendor must also be able to provide workable recommendations and advice to client executive management on emerging technology, system improvements and maintenance related to NLP-enabling the TSB.   The vendor must be able to work with current MHS contractors also working in this domain, including Wisper/IMC, Inc.; NGIT; MEDICOMP; and Nuance, to determine alternatives to NLP enable the TSB and/or AHLTA to include a thorough analysis of costs and ben efits. Task 1 Natural Language Processing Use Case Requirements Workshop L&C will provide a one day workshop with the key stakeholders. Objectives include identifying the vision for using NLP in MHS and identifying the impact of such cases on the approach for enabling NLP in the TSB Ontology.   L&C will provide background and f oundational training in natural language processing,  ontologies, and lexicons to the participants in the workshop.   TATRC Task Manager and L&C shall agree on the stated goals, objectives, and schedule prior to commencement of workshop.    Task 2   White Paper "	Create white paper describing the analysis, findings, advantages, benefits and risks of approaches to adding natural language processing capability to the TSB Ontology. "	Investigate the possibility of creation and use of a Generic LinKBase/NLP ontology "	Identify the levels and types of effort for creating the Generic LinKBase/NLP ontology "	Describe the core design of solution and the investigation of viability "	Identify the level and types of effort for modifying basic TeSSI platform to work with the components to work with the part of speech mapping/derivation from the Generic LinKBase/NLP ontology.  "	Analyze the effort of mapping Generic LinKBase/NLP ontology to TSB Ontology  o	Identify the options and effectiveness of automation o	Identify the necessity to add a different upper level framework to the TSB Ontology o	Analyze mapping requirements for the generic LinKBase NLP to the TSB Ontology  "	Initial questions to be considered:  "	When parts of speech, word classes, and features are extrapolated to children of concepts in the TSB Ontology and are attached to concepts in the Generic LinKBase without issues, what mechanisms can put place to ensure that lexicon information is being p ropagated through correct concept modeling? "	What parties will manage the generated lexemes? "	How will storage of lexemes be handled?  Analyze options for adding and maintaining part of speech information to TSB ontology "	Transposition from LinKBase and using the part of speech generator "	Describe  the design and effort of adding the required upper level framework to the TSB ontology in order to map part of speech information "	Describe the design and effort of creating a mechanism to maintain part of speech generation for newly added terms in the TSB Ontology and the consequent changes in modeling processes. "	Documentation of findings and analysis  "	Describe analysis, findings, advantages, benefits and risks of options for adding natural language processing technology to the TSB Ontology in a white paper. Task 3:  Presentation of Findings  "	Create and deliver a presentation of analysis, findings, advantages, benefits and risks of options for adding natural language processing technology to the TSB Ontology. C.  Deliverables - Due Dates to be determined by the Government  1	Requirements/Use Case Workshop		 2	White Paper of Analysis, Findings and Recommendations 3	Presentation of Analysis, Findings and Recommendations, not to exceed one year from date of award D.  Proposal Submission Requirements: The vendor shall provide the number of labor hours, labor categories, labor rates, travel costs, and other direct costs for each Task.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Should offerors require additional clarification, contact Robin Willis-Guille at willisrl@state.gov or FedBid.com at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR>CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received at that email address no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: •	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  •	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. •	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. •	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.   Since this equipment is required to meet operational requirements by replenishing depleted inventory, CA/CST/CS must take physical possession of the scanners soon as possible.   Even if another manufacturer’s equipment similar to the Datalogic Gryphon Barcode Scanner in terms of specifications and functionality were to become available at this juncture, they could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that they would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by September of this year.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  For the past few years, fingerprint scanners have been a component of the US Government’s biometric initiative to prevent the processing of duplicate applications with altered personal information (name, place of birth, date of birth, etc.) and the subsequent issuance of visas based on fraudulent data.  Recently, the US Congress mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  Traditional fingerprint collection methods employing paper cards and ink are slow and inaccurate.  Due to this factor, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enhance and expedite the capture process by making it entirely electronic. In coordination with the FBI, Consular Affairs is scheduled to pilot 10-fingerprint capture at US Consulates in Riyadh and Dharan in September 2006. Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian scanners are required for this project.  They were selected because they have been extensively tested and used by the FBI.  The scanner is the first live scan device to meet the size and functional requirements of the Joint Agency User Group.  The Guardian L SCAN is certified for both civil identification flats and full criminal 10-print rolls and flats, and the image quality complies with the FBI EFTS Appendix F.  Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner is found to be the most robust and reliable (in terms of output and data capture and interpretation) units of their kind now available. The addition of ten print fingerprint scanning technology will enable the Bureau to identify applicants with criminal or other US law enforcement records based on biometric data, regardless of the written personal information submitted on their applications.  This will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s HST Pilot/Recovery/QA project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales. D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. (ALL ITEMS CONFIGURED INTO LINE ITEM 001 PRIOR TO SHIPMENT!!)

The CORRECTED statement of work is as follows:
STATEMENT OF WORK

ATTESTATION ENGAGEMENT and PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR 
USDOL?S INTERNATIONAL CHILD LABOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

I.	INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to obtain Advisory and Assistance Services to meet on-going needs of the ILAB International Child Labor Program (ICLP) on attestation engagement and Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) issues.  

Offerors should submit proposals addressing the objective(s) identified in the Introduction (Section I), the scope of work (Section II), and identified delivery requirements (Section IV).  

Background

USDOL?s International Child Labor Program (ICLP), within the Bureau of International Labor Affairs conducts research on international child labor, administers grant and contracts to organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate exploitive child labor, and raises awareness about this important international child labor issue.  

The ICLP?s grant administration responsibilities have grown quickly since 1995. ICLP has administered some 180 child labor projects in over 70 countries around the world through: 1) the International Labor Organization?s International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (ILO/IPEC); and 2) various organizations that implement Child Labor Education Initiative projects to expand access to basic quality education in areas with a high incidence of child labor.	

The demands for increased accountability in both the financial and performance arenas have grown significantly with the expansion in the numbers of ICLP projects in operation throughout the developing world.  To address these demands, ICLP initiated a project level attestation engagement program in FY 2005 to examine the timeliness and accuracy of grantee GPRA data, financial reporting and compliance USDOL and USG regulations.  The program has contracted under a Blanket Purchase Agreement with an accounting firm to perform attestation engagements of its cooperative agreements in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards published by the Government Accountability Office.  The ICLP has also negotiated with the External Auditor for the International Labor Organization (ILO) to conduct attestation engagements of the projects that ICLP funds through the ILO.  This advisory services contract will provide expert advice and training to ICLP employees to ensure that:  1) the work conducted under the BPA and by the ILO External Auditor meets ICLP?s needs and that the quality is acceptable under the relevant professional standards; 2) project level compliance and GPRA performance data reviews conducted by ICLP staff are performed in an efficient and effective manner.

The numbers and complexity of ICLP projects, as well as the evolution of GPRA requirements under the budget and performance integration initiative of the President?s Management Agenda and OMB?s Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) also require that ICLP obtain the services of a contractor with expertise in the performance management arena.  In particular, the program is measuring and reporting on its cost efficiency.  The contractor will assist ICLP in refining its measurement approaches, assist ILAB in setting and achieving new efficiency targets, and offer guidance on using the efficiency measures to improve ICLP decision making.  In addition, the consultant will be needed to advise ICLP on assessing Education Initiative (EI) performance data and provide assistance to the program in revising the measures or data collection procedures, if warranted, to ensure that the performance data accurately and validly measure the outcomes of the EI projects.

Question: 
I am having trouble with obtaining the information and specific requirements listed under the Security Requirements section of the SOW (Line Items a - i), which I am told can make a significant difference, especially the TEMPEST requirements. 

Answer:  
The JSF Security authorities decided to eliminate the TEMPEST requirement from the SOW.

Under the Place and Period of Performance Section (Line Item b) a delivery date is not given, however; just below the NOTE paragraph on the same page, the SOW states that the "delivery must be 60 days after receipt of purchase order and FOB Destination". 

Answer:
The Delivery of supplies/materials and Period of Performance to be completed 90 days upon Receipt of Order. 

1. Is this to be certified and by whom? Yes it will be accredited by SAF/AQ and it is the contractors responsibility to meet accreditation requirements stated in the SOW.

2. Are Fire sprinklers be required due to hanger location? No, however, the base fire department is requiring pull station(s), photoelectric smoke detectors, and audio visual alarms. Notifier is the base standard. 


3. Who will be doing the utility connections; will we be terminating at the building for electrical and telecom? Connections from mobile unit to building power will be done in house; all interior wiring and devices shall be installed by the proposing contractor. Typically, we are looking for a "plug and play" operation. 

4. What are the internal telecomm requirements? 8 comm/data connections in the main room and one comm/data connection in the secondary room located within the SCIF. Data lines shall be fiber and Cat6 for phones. Customer will specify.


5. Who is supplying the Hirsch and IDS systems? The Hirsch access control devices will be GFE and the Advantor IDS  (base standard) shall be provided by the proposing contractors. For the Advantor, we are assuming 2 motion detectors, 1 keypad and 1 control panel, and 2 BMS's. 

6. Who is responsible for the internal wiring of the access control points? Please note on drawings. Proposing contractor shall be responsible for all internal installation of conduits, conductors, and devices. Access control devices will be GFE (Hirsch). On our concept drawing, 3 ea entry and 3 ea exit proximity pads (one set per door), 3 magnetic door locks, one M8N control panel (vestibule room), and 2 TXRS (F/O).


7. What codes listed under ?execution? are required ? All standard national building/manufacturing codes to include, but not limited to the NEC, IBC, NFPA, Life Safety Codes are applicable.   

8. What is the weight of crypto safe? The crypto safes weigh 1000 lbs each, and there are two each (see attached revised concept drawing for location) .


9. Who is doing utility connections? See item #3  

10. There is a ramp shown but not ?called out? on the bid request.  The ramp shown will not fit-can we ramp the building?After further review, we will not require a ramp to be built at this time however, we will be requiring one set of stairs with landings for each entry and exit point.

NOTE - We are looking to industry for the best solution for our project. Drawing is "conceptual" and not limited to these approximate dimensions. Show us what you propose will best fit our requirements. 

Most important, when the job is complete, the government expects a complete and useable product.


Please contact terence.vickers@edwards.af.mil for Revised Conceptual layout via email.  NOTE:  Due to time contraints, the final response time will have to be as listed above - 19 Sep 2006, 4:30pm, PST.

<DESC>This is Amendment 2, to W911S8-06-Q-0034 to make notification: Extend the quote due date.  Quotes are due on September 20, 2006 at 11:00:00 A.M. Pacific Standard Time.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the purchase of commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicita tion.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number W911S8-06-Q-0034 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotations.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect th rough Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 and DCN 20060908.  This requirement is UNRESTRICTED with a NAICS Code of 334290 and a corresponding size standard of 750 Employees.  The description of the commercial item is Infant Band System. Delivery and installation time shall be no later than December 31, 2006.  A copy of the award document shall be distributed to  to the DOL Central Receiving Point, Fort Lewis, WA 98433-9500.  Acceptance will be at the destination.  FOB point is destination .  The selection resulting from this request for quotations will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote from a responsible quoter.  Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral orde r will be issued using a SF 1449.  A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  An addendum to this provision is appli cable, in which paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted.  Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corre sponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.  Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Iden tification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Ac cess Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holiday s, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concr ete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given prior ity.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North F ort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its  drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation t hrough any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through th e Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Ac cess Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed ac cess only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort L ewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the empl oyee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Ma in (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor emplo yees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access  identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor  employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access  identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longe r needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification ba dge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Go vernment installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification ba dges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copi ed by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor empl oyee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be us ed for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAG PC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the co ntractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accorda nce with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.  Quoters are required to submit completed copie s of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.
