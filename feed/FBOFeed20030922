<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Dataradio, 299 Johnson Ave, Waseca, MN 56093, for the purchase of 37 data radios type:  (For digital data transmission only) IntagraTR  UHF 403-512 Mhz, Model #242-4048-210 in the sub band of 403-419 Mhz ops range.  The present telemetry system already uses this radio and requires this data radio model due to compatibility of the data transfer protocol of the existing system.  This compatibility factor extends into the overall self-diagnostics capability built into the data radio.  To substitute any other unit for this data radio would disable or severely cripple a vital part of the YUMARIV telemetry system.

This procurement will be solicited under NAVAIR solicitation number N00019-03-R-0095. The AMPD will be forward fit into the F/A-18E/F aircraft and shall comply with the approved Advanced Mission Computer and Displays (AMC&D) Performance Specification and AMPD Interface Control Document. The contract will provide for the procurement of up to an estimated maximum quantity of 177 each AMPDs, including spares. The production support element of this procurement will include, but is not limited to, engineering investigations, engineering change proposals, integration and testing, spare and repair parts, engineering technical support, and integrated logistics support. Deliveries will be made to various locations throughout the continental United States. Delivery will be required to begin within 14 months from the date of contract award or option exercise. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Due to the incorporation of a new display glass in the AMPD for Lot 28, additional test and requalification efforts must be performed.

Boeing is the developer and manufacturer of the F/A-18E/F as well as the developer and integrator of the AMPD, and as such is the only firm with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data to successfully meet the requirements of the F/A-18E/F production aircraft as well as fleet spare delivery requirements.  While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability to respond to this requirement and may submit information that shall be considered by the Naval Air Systems Command.

There is no other known alternative since Lloyd's is the sole source for the Registry Number and has supplied this information for over one hundred years. The proposed contract period would be 12 months for the following: (1) Annual fee for Lloyd's Monthly Extract; (2) Annual fee for Lloyd's quarterly NOAA data extract; and (3) Annual subscription renewal for access to the enhanced version of Seaweb. Other firms who can furnish the items above are invited to submit clear and convincing data substantiating their capability to furnsih the entire requirement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334511   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for the following eight (8) items of subsurface geological mapping equipment to be used to support the activities of the USEPA's Environmental Response Team Center (ERTC) in Las Vegas, Nevada.  This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  Interested firms must identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Sources wishing to be considered must provide notice of  interest to the office identified above.  Upon receipt of this notice of interest a Request for Quotation, RFQ-OH-03-00206, will be distributed providing the interested party with the full listing of the item specifications for this requirement.  RFQ's will not be issued after 12:00 noon (EST) on  Friday September 26th and all quotations must be received no later than 3:00PM (EST) Friday September 26th.   This acquisition is subject to full and open competition, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by EPA.  Submit your notice of interest in writing to  Matthew J. Growney at the above address or by fax at 513-487-2107. Item #1 A EM31-MK2 Soil Conductivity Meter (includes built-in datalogger, software, cables, and chargers). The EPA seeks to map geological variations, groundwater contaminants or any subsurface feature associated with changes in  ground conductivity, using an electromagnetic inductive technique that allows measurement without electrodes or ground contact. With this inductive method, surveys can be carried out under most geologic conditions including those of high surface resistivity such as sand, gravel and asphalt.  Ground  conductivity (quad-phase) and magnetic susceptivility (in-phase) measurements  shall be read directly from an integrated data logger (which can be easily removed from the console for data transfer). Real-time (RT) data collection shall be available by connecting a computer directly to the RS232  output port on the front panel with an RS232 interconnect cable. The effective depth of exploration shall be about six meters, making it ideal for geotechnical and environmental site characterization. Package includes built-in datalogger, software, cables, and chargers. Item #2 A data acquisition  system for Item #1. Includes Allegro PC, cables and chargers. Item #3 EM61-MK2 Metal Detector (Complete with trailer-mount, hand-held Allegro PC, cables, batteries and chargers). The EPA is seeking a time domain metal detector which detects both ferrous and non-ferrous objects with excellent  spatial resolution. Target response is a single, sharply defined peak, facilitating quick and accurate location. A single 200 liter (55 gal.) drum can be detected at depths greater than three meters; modification for increased power, to increase both the sensitivity to smaller targets and depth of  exploration shall be available.  Data from multiple time gates - three or four, user-selectable - are recorded to provide a more complete measurement of the response decay rate for improved target characterization (and discrimination). Data acquisition is supported by a provided field computer with  software, cables, batteries, and chargers. Important features include real-time graphic display of data for review and quality control; high capacity data storage (min. 330,000 data sets) for extended survey time; increased rate of data collection; and additional input connections for simultaneous  collection of EM and GPS data.  The system is immediately GPS compatible. The system can be pulled as a trailer (trailer included), in single or multiple unit configurations, or carried by an operator with a belt harness.  Provide additional rechargeable battery. Item #4 PROTEM Digital Receiver  (cable reference, 30-channels and three sequential component measurement) The EPA is seeking a digital, 3 component receiver to function with Item #5 a transmitter with choice of receiver coils to cover all applications. With 23 bit resolution, system bandwidth of 270 kHz, microsecond sampling  gates and simultaneous XYZ component measurements, the receiver shall provide the ultimate in time domain capability. Provide additional rechargeable battery.  Includes all cables, software, and equipment to function with Items #4 through 8. Item #5 TEM47 Transmitter The EPA is seeking a  transmitter that functions with the Item #4 receiver and the appropriate receiver coils to make up the unit for various applications. The transmitter shall most often be used for shallow resistivity sounding delineating groundwater contamination plumes, saline intrusion and geologic units. In this  mode, single turn transmitter loops from 5 m up to 100 m on a side, with turn-off times as short as half a microsecond, can be used to give maximum near-surface resolution. The transmitter output current of 3A into a 100 m x 100 m loop gives good response and resolution to depths of 150 m, making  this the ideal instrument for resistivity sounding over a large area. The 30 gate, 3 time decade measurement is usually enough to cover the full decay curve including the early time gates, without changing base frequency. The transmitter uses a reference cable to achieve the high synchronization  accuracy required for shallow sounding. This receiver coil has the bandwidth necessary to capture the earliest portion of the transient decay. Provide additional rechargeable battery.  Item #6 A high frequency 3D receiver coil for use with above receiver.   Item #7 A 100 m x 100 m transmitter  loop with winder and reel for above transmitter. Item #8 EMIGMA Professional Inversion Software. 3D Interpretation Software Platform for Mag, EM, IP, VLF, Resistivity, MT and CSAMT    3D Visualization, 2D and 3D Griding and Interpolation. Fast and Accurate 3D Simulations over a wide range of  geological scenarios. Flexible and intuitive user interface. 1D+3D Inversion.

The lessor, Westwood Management, has identified Freestate Electrical as the only contractor allowed to do electrical work in the building because of insurance issues.

<DESC>BACKGROUND: Section 521 of the Benefit Improvement and Protection Act 2000 (BIPA) revised section 1869 of the Social Security Act to mandate that the Secretary develop a revised process for carrying out appeals of Medicare fee-for-service claims.
The BIPA requires, among other things, the establishment of new entities known as Qualified Independent Contractors (QICs) to conduct the second level of appeal, and establishment of stringent timeframes which require the QICs to conduct reconsiderations within 30 days. The introduction of QICs creates an additional appeals level for Part A claim determinations and replaces the Part B hearing level of appeal. The establishment of Qualified Independent Contractors (QICs) is an effort envisioned by CMS as an important step in implementing the revised second level appeals process as mandated by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act Section 521. 

This procurement will allow CMS to implement two major components of the BIPA 521second level appeals process. The QICs will adjudicate reconsiderations and expedited reconsiderations of redeterminations made by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, or quality improvement organizations, using established protocols.  In addition, the QICs will collect and transmit information regarding the receipt and disposition of reconsiderations and expedited reconsiderations via the Medicare Appeals System (MAS). The second component will be an Administrative QIC or AdQIC. The AdQIC will provide technical support for the MAS, collect, track, and distribute information regarding the receipt, processing, and disposition of reconsiderations and expedited reconsiderations, develop and update protocols, and conduct training. 

CMS anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts, which will have a base period with multiple option periods.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Cathy Baldwin, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-5791, or by sending e-mail to CBaldwin@cms.hhs.gov. E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  CMS will generate a bidders list as a result of this synopsis.  Companies may request to be included on the bidders list by contacting Ms. Baldwin with the above listed information.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS.  CMS anticipates release of the Request For Proposal in early October 2003.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements: reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs. Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved. New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives. Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals. The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this RFP to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels. It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs. It is broken into two subtopics for consideration. A. SUBTOPIC I The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles. Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control. In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications. However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control. This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC. The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device. Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels. Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production. It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases. Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work. Technological innovations will be highly encouraged. A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented. A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included. A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones. The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip. It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years. B) SUBTOPIC II This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles. It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW. An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW. The Statement of Work (SOW) will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs. The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations. The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues. The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units. A viable path to production must be demonstrated. A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively. Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions. Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified. The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles. A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation. The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle. It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. A detailed RFP has been issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements. An Offeror may elect to bid on one or both subtopics as further described in the RFP. Please direct your requests for receipt of the RFP to Christine M. Sullivan by e-mail (sullivancm@ornl.gov) or fax (865) 241-2426.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is EC3000-204-01 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The associated North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517410 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million. This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data. Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities. Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.  MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/  and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/ . The United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) is located in Suitland, MD.    The current primary means for the exchange of non-alert and alert information between the USMCC and other MCCs is X.25 via Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) and an X.75 international gateway provided by MCI.   It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs is low and 56 kbps links are more than sufficient. NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for access to an alternative X.75 gateway under the bidder's control, preferably in the United States, or in another country if a domestic gateway is unavailable, that can be accessed to allow the USMCC to continue X.25 data communications until at least 2010. The current figures and percentages are:  (a) OUTGOING TRAFFIC:  356 messages per day, averaging 200k bytes in a range of 150k to 250k bytes and where X.25 represents 42% of the total; and (b) INCOMING TRAFFIC: 231 messages per day, averaging 123k bytes in a range of 73k to 173k bytes and where X.25 represents 80% of the total. All X.25 connections originate and terminate at a Government X.25 switch. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive messages internationally by X.25. International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide international communication services as follows:  (a) provide a dedicated X.25 line to Suitland, MD to allow for simultaneous transmitting and receiving over a minimum of 64 virtual circuits; (b) provide circuit status confirmation;  (c) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services  without any changes or modifications to the contract; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps on an RS-232C physical interface.  The USMCC can also accept speeds ranging from 9.6kbps through 64kbps on a V.35 or RS-232C physical interface;  (e) the X.25 protocol must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards;    (f) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (g) provide for a backup access to the vendor's network in the event of a failure of the dedicated line; and, (h) all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site except for the backup access sited in item (g). Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis. The service must have an error transmission rate of one in ten million or less. The service shall have an operational availability of 99.5 % or greater calculated for each calendar day.  The reliability, maintainability and availability parameters defined in this specification do not include any impact due to Government equipment outages. All preventive maintenance should be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption in service will be treated as an outage subject to an outage recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. (b) Globally accessible: The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e.g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria are expected to be added next year.)  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites without notice to the vendor on the presumption that the vendor has a communications agreement in place with the nation accommodating that site. (c) Responsive maintenance: Due to the critical nature of the information to be disseminated, the contractor shall provide a single point of contact for trouble reporting and provide 24-hour trouble support with a response time not to exceed two (2) hours for the commencement of trouble resolution.  The USMCC shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of any unavoidable, scheduled outage. The communications service shall provide for automatic rerouting of messages within the network to eliminate single points of failure within the cloud. The communications service shall provide circuit status confirmation and provide a timely method of receipt verification. (d) Security: The communications service shall provide the resources to ensure that inbound traffic is restricted to authorized call-ins designated by the USMCC and all inbound traffic is authenticated using parameters such as calling address, called address and call user data. (e) Other Considerations: The minimum transmission speed to the network must be 9.6 kbps; a service requirement above 56 kbps is not anticipated or required. The Contractor shall comply with the following reporting requirements during the installation phase of the work: the Contractor shall attend weekly telecoms with the participants and the customer(s); the Contractor shall attend a formal mid-point briefing to be given for NOAA; and the Contractor shall attend a final formal briefing that will be given by NOAA and in which the Contractor shall provide an annotated final report. This is a firm fixed price requirement.  The Contractor shall provide a firm fixed price for the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):  CLIN 0001 The Contractor shall provide x.25 Switching Services in accordance with the requirements stated above; CLIN 0002 Monthly Recurring Charge; and CLIN 0003 Nonrecurring Charge (One-Time Only).  The firm fixed price shall include the cost for all aspects of this requirement. FOB Destination. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. This FAR reference can be retrieved from the Internet at the following URL: www.arnet.gov/far.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is EC3000-204-02 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The associated North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517410 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million. This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data. Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division (DSD) of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities. Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.   MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. Telex and fax messages are sent from the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) to various international SAR Points Of Contact (SPOCs) and U.S. Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs).  The USMCC is located in Suitland, MD. Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/   and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/.    NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for the acquisition of messaging services that provide the USMCC capabilities to send facsimile message and send and receive telex messages.   These services are anticipated to allow the USMCC to continue national and international fax and telex data communications at least until 2010. It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs and the RCCs is low and a data rate of not less than 9.6 kbps nor more than 56 kbps are adequate for the mission. The current average byte volume per fax and telex is as follows: we send about 3500 faxes per month [117 per day]; we send about 160 Telex messages per month [5 per day]; and, we receive about 50 telex messages per month [2 per day]. Sample telex and fax messages appear in Appendix 1. Countries requiring telex and fax are shown in Appendix 2.  The USMCC requires near real-time automatic delivery i.e. a delivery time not to exceed 15 minutes from the beginning of a transmission to its receipt. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive telex messages, and send fax messages over a X.25 connection or other vendor provided transport or the Internet between the USMCC and the contractor's network. The International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide  communication services as follows: (a) provide circuit status confirmation; (b) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services (telex, or fax) without any changes or modifications to the contract; (c) telex service must have connection to international telex and be  as close to universal as possible; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps;  messages designated for fax or telex delivery must be delivered in near real-time, which for the purposes of this contract, is defined as no longer than 15 minutes from the start of transmission to start of receipt of message at destination; (e) provide a timely method of receipt verification (not to exceed 15 minutes); (f) the X.25 protocol, if used, must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards; (g) provide a timely method of delivery failure notification to the USMCC (not to exceed 15 minutes); (h) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (i) handle text format using International Alphabet #5 (IA5) representation; and (j)  all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site. Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis. The service must be reliable and must have an error transmission rate of one in ten million or less. The service shall have an operational availability of 99.5 % or greater calculated for each calendar day.  The reliability, maintainability and availability parameters defined in this specification do not include any impact due to Government equipment outages. All preventive maintenance should be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption in service will be treated as an outage subject to an outage recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. (b) Globally accessible. The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e .g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria are expected to be added next year.)  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites without notice to the vendor. (c) Responsive maintenance: Due to the critical nature of the information to be disseminated, the contractor shall provide a single point of contact for trouble reporting and provide 24-hour trouble support with a response time not to exceed two (2) hours for the commencement of trouble resolution.  The USMCC shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of any unavoidable, scheduled outage. The communications service shall provide circuit status confirmation and provide a timely method of receipt verification. (d) Security: The communications service shall provide the resources to ensure that inbound telex traffic is restricted to authorized call-ins designated by the USMCC. The Contractor shall comply with the following reporting requirements during the installation phase of the work: the Contractor shall attend weekly telecons with the participants and the customer(s); the Contractor shall attend a formal mid-point briefing to be given for NOAA; and the Contractor shall attend a final formal briefing that will be given by NOAA and in which the Contractor shall provide an annotated final report.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force Electronic System Center (ESC) to determine potential sources capable of providing an Alternative Sensor for the AN/FMQ-13 Wind Measuring Set.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting information from unmanned air vehicle (UAV) manufacturers, aviation technology firms and other interested parties on aeronautical technology available for providing an affordable approach to use expendable and non-expendable, mini-UAVs to carry sensor payloads for the detection and tracking of aerosolized chemical and biological warfare agents and radiological particles resulting from a Counterproliferation (CP) counterforce weapon strike.  The expendable and non-expendable, mini-UAVs will become integral parts of a Biological Combat Assessment System (BCAS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) planned to begin in FY04 and end in FY09. 

The BCAS ATD integrates, tests, and demonstrates a remote, point-sample collection sensor system in the second quarter of FY06 (2QFY06), and a remote, point-sample collection, detection, and identification system in the fourth quarter of FY07 (4QFY07). Included in the integration, test, and demonstration capabilities will be satellite and line of sight communication systems; Global Positioning Systems (GPS); optical/infrared real-time video systems; communication collection and relay; and laser designators.  

This ATD will culminate in a technology demonstration of a near real-time sample collection, detection, identification, tracking, characterization, and communication system for Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) aerosolized agents released during counterforce strikes against a simulated WMD target, and performance of battle damage assessment.  In addition, the system will demonstrate the capabilities to perform real-time imagery, signal intelligence (SIGINT), and target designation function during ingress to the target area, loitering over the target area, and egress from the target area to a designated recovery point.

Sustainment of the residual assets produced during the ATD and requisite training for operational military personnel will follow in FY08 and FY09 while the developed capabilities are transitioned into an acquisition program. 
BCAS ATD Concept and System Description

<DESC>SUBJECT:	Research and Development Sources Sought for Potential Development of a Drilling System for a Mars Mission THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  This document is for information and planning purposes only and will allow industry the opportunity to verify the reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement and to submit a capability statement.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.  It is not known at this time if a solicitation will result from this request for information (RFI).  If a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on the	 NASA Ames Business Opportunities website.	System description and source qualifications should be limited to ten pages and submitted in electronic format by Email to Shari Kamm @ skamm@mail.arc.nasa.gov, by the response date specified above. In responding, reference RFI2-38314 SLK.  NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information from industry to determine the existence of sources with the capability to develop a working prototype of a drilling system for a Mars mission that would be ready for integrated field testing at a field site in Oklahoma for 14 days in March 2005, and at a field site in southwestern Spain for 30 days in June of 2005. Participation of the source in weekly team meetings and project reviews, to be held approximately semi-annually, would also be required.  This prototype drilling system would be used in a NASA field experiment in a Mars analog environment to demonstrate technology for drilling on Mars.  Due to cost and schedule constraints, modification of an existing drilling system is considered to be the cost effective approach to this requirement.  The drilling system must be capable of meeting the following requirements, and sources must demonstrate that they can meet these requirements by providing data from an existing drill working in a relevant environment that: (1) does not utilize a drilling fluid (liquid or gas) for cuttings transport; (2) has been demonstrated to drill to a depth of at least 5 meters in dry consolidated materials; (3) has a development path shown for depth capability of 20 meters or greater; (4) provides cores for all depths drilled; (5) has a nominal borehole diameter of 2 inches; (6) cuts off and retrieves dry consolidated cores; (7) retrieves unconsolidated cores; (8) has demonstrated thermal disturbance of core less than ten Celsius; (9) ensures hole stability in unconsolidated materials; (10) handles transitions from unconsolidated to consolidated materials; (11) requires operating power less than 100 watts average; (12) is capable of drilling at least 3 meters per day in sandstone; (13) is capable of drilling through a broad range of rock types including consolidated and unconsolidated sandstone, shales, and basalt; (14) has been demonstrated in the field as an integrated system; and (15) will be ready for a field deployment in Spring 2005.  It is also highly desirable that most of the functions of the drill (such as drilling, core breakoff, core retrieval, and cuttings removal) be mechanized and/or computer controllable, so that minimal human involvement is required.  Interested and qualified sources are requested to provide a statement of current capability and past performance information.  Sources must demonstrate management and technical experience on similar acquisitions specifically addressing the requirements specified in this synopsis and demonstrate the ability to successfully compete for this requirement.  The following information should be provided:    1.  A description of the respondent’s existing drill system that either meets or could be modified to meet the requirements specified above, and what has been demonstrated to date by this drill system in terms of mass, power, depth, materials, and mechanization/automation.  A detailed description of the requisite modifications to the existing drill system to meet the above-specified requirements.  Specifically address each of the requirements specified above.	     2.  An estimated schedule for modifying the drilling system to meet the above-specified requirements.   3.  A description of the respondent’s past experience in successfully performing this type of contract, including a description of the contract and name and phone number of the point of contact for the purchasing organization. 4.  Company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and type and business size.    AGAIN, this synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". B. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the NASA ombudsman.  Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting officer or as specified elsewhere in this document.  The Ombudsmen for each of the NASA installations and for the agency and their phone numbers are available at the following URL:  http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/library/Omb.html

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government in an award of any contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking commercial technology solutions to requirements associated with response to the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  This synopsis seeks to identify qualified sources from Government or Industry for the following requirements:
1. Non-Intrusive Chemical Agent Detection. Capabilities to rapidly and non-intrusively detect and specifically identify by name inaccessible chemical warfare agents (CWA) and their precursors are required.  These capabilities must detect and identify all known CWA and precursors while contained in military ordnance, storage, and manufacturing containers or reactor vessels of unknown dimensions, thickness or material.  Other requirements include the ability to store and transfer detection data for later analysis, improve detector capability via software upgrades without requiring detector rebuild or replacement, and conduct pre-planned product improvement necessary to leverage technology maturity and advancements.
2. Chemical Agent Defeat. Rapid, lightweight, and easily employed capabilities to destroy, detoxify or otherwise neutralize all chemical warfare agents (CWA) are required.  All CWA include the multiple variants of G-type nerve agents, V-type nerve agents, Fourth Generation Agents, vesicants, blood agents, choking agents and incapacitating agents.  The program includes research, development, testing, evaluation and fielding of multi-spectrum (chemical, EMS, biological) methods targeting CWA either in bulk storage or in the production process.  The focus will be on those capabilities that minimize the logistical burden in terms of size, weight, ease-of-use and associated hazard to the operator.
3.  Non-Intrusive Biological Agent Detection. Capabilities to rapidly and non-intrusively detect and specifically identify by name inaccessible biological warfare agents (BWA) are required.  These capabilities must detect and identify all biological agents at all stages of weaponization (dry spores or liquid growth media) while contained on containers of unknown dimensions, thickness or material. Other requirements include the ability to store and transfer detection data for later analysis, improve detector capability via software upgrades without requiring detector rebuild or replacement, and conduct pre-planned product improvement necessary to leverage technology maturity and advancements.
4.  Biological Agent Defeat. Rapid, lightweight, and easily employed capabilities to destroy, or kill (no longer virulent estimated at 9-11 logs of kill) all biological warfare agents (BWA) are required.  All BWA include the multiple variants of microorganisms (including viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and dormant forms of bacteria and fungi).  Methods should be able to destroy even the most concentrated forms of biological materials, either in wet, dry or sporolated form, in the presence and absence of contaminating organic species.   The program includes research, development, testing, evaluation and fielding of multi-spectrum (chemical, EMS, biological) methods targeting BWA either in bulk storage or in the production process.  The focus will be on those capabilities that minimize the logistical burden in terms of size, weight, ease-of-use and associated hazard to the operator.

<SUBJECT>A -- Space Control Industry Conference
<DESC>The Air Force intends to hold an Industry Conference to receive information related to the Space Control Mission Area.  The Space Control Mission Area ensures the freedom of operations within and throughout the space medium, while denying its use to adversaries. As space has become an area of vital national interest, the United States must be prepared to protect and defend its space systems, including spacecraft, communications links, and ground segments.  Space Control includes three sub-missions: Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS) and Offensive Counterspace (OCS).  SSA near-term modernization and materiel solutions include developing a constellation of space-based tracking/surveillance sensors.  DCS near-term material solutions include developing a system to detect attacks on US space systems and improved processing for attack characterization. OCS near-term materiel solutions include developing ground systems for the temporary denial of space asset information to adversaries. The Industry Conference will consist of two sessions.  The first session, on 15 October 2003, will consist of presentations to all conference attendees; the Air Force and the Mission Area Prime Integrating Contract (MAPIC) contractor team will lead off with overview presentations followed by Industry presentations to the entire audience.  The second session, on 16 October 2003, will consist of industry presentations made to only the Government, FFRDC, and MAPIC team.  Please focus your presentations to highlight corporate expertise in the following interest areas: precise space navigation at GEO, high resolution imaging hardware, microsat buses, spacecraft power, spacecraft propulsion, radiation hardened FPGA/CPU technology, lightweight optics, mobile high power communications systems, high speed (gigabit/second) data links, signal processing hardware advancements, visible and IR sensors, radar/lidar, radar jammers and Architecture and Systems Engineering Concepts (e.g., modeling and simulation tools and technology development). Also of interest is material and technologies that enable rapid reaction OCS and DCS capabilities such as commercially available or rapid prototype terrestrial wideband SATCOM systems and components (e.g., antennas, high-power amplifiers, modems, signal processors). The goal of the conference is to provide Industry an opportunity to brief their Space Control capabilities and to foster open discussions in the general session or at the individual sessions. Companies are limited to 4 attendees each on Day 1; companies having multiple presentations may send more than one team, but team size will be limited to 4 members. An agenda and schedule will be created based on received responses.  Presentations to the general audience will be limited to 35 minutes each including set up time.   Presentations on Day 2 will be limited to 45 minutes unless the responses dictate otherwise.  Multiple presentations can be arranged upon request.  Presentations will be limited to UNCLASSIFIED material unless prior arrangements are made; however, the facility will support SECRET level discussions.  Briefing times and locations will be posted on the web site below. An agenda, map and other supporting information will be located on the Internet at HTTP://SCMAPIC.SYSTEMS.TRW.COM. The Industry Conference is planned for 15 October 2003 at the Aerospace Corporation Bldg A-8, 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245 and on 16 October at Northrop Grumman Bldg R-2, 1 Space Park Drive, Redondo Beach, CA 90278.

<SUBJECT>A -- Crosshairs (Sniper Neutralization)
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is being released by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.   The Government does intend to issue a formal solicitation during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2003.  The goal of this RFI is to obtain innovative technological system or subsystem concepts that will enable the Government to fulfill the vision of the development of CROSSHAIRS.  The program has two objectives.  The primary objective of the CROSSHAIRS program is to design and develop an affordable capability for detecting, identifying and neutralizing a sniper threat.  A secondary objective of the program is to detect incoming mortars and rocket propelled grenades and take appropriate action.  Responses after sniper detection can range from non-lethal options such as high resolution, judicial quality photography, paint balls or dyes, blinding laser flash, or rubber bullets to lethal options.  The Concept of Operations is to provide a HUMMWV mounted detection and response system while on the move and a lightweight portable freestanding low power unit for platoon or squadrons while stationary.  It is envisioned that the CROSSHAIRS system will be employed during hostile and peace keeping operations where friendly forces require point defense from stationary and mobile platforms.  The system should consider having a multitude of safety features to preclude friendly fire.  The Government predicts that the technology will require development of ultra-fast detection and tracking systems that operate in near real time and determines shot point of origin and trajectory less than 0.1 second from shot firing.  Industry responses may address the entire system or can focus on solutions to individual technology challenges. Technology challenges of particular interest are: low false rate algorithms; quick reactive sensor techniques for a 360 degrees azimuth and 60 deg elevation detection zone; robust data collection for tracking firing source; fast response slewing solutions; and advanced highly incapacitating non-lethal response.  Companies responding to this announcement should provide a high level system description of complete solution or a description of a subsystem technology that will enable or enhance the objectives at hand.  Respondents will receive e-mail information on details of future program solicitations, directions and industry day announcements as they become available.  Details will also be posted on the WWW.DARPA.MIL web site.  Interested parties desiring to attend the industry day should submit no more than two names, e-mail, company, telephone number and address to hayesj@centrava.com with CROSSHAIRS Industry Day in the subject line.  Please be advised that all responses to this RFI will be treated as proprietary information and it will not be considered as a proposal.  Any technical information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary.  Responses should be digitally submitted and can be mailed or e- mailed to Dr. Karen Wood, DARPA Program Manager, at DARPA, TTO, 3701 N Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22203 or kwood@DARPA.mil, respectively.  Maximum of 4 page responses should be received no later than COB October 3, 2003.

This notice constitutes the only solicitation; price quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation (DTCG81-03-Q-QLD888) is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14. FAR clauses and provisions are available via internet address: http://www.arnet.gov/far/. This RFQ being solicited UNRESTRICTED. The North American Industry Classification System 611430 and Small Business Size Standard is $6.0 millions. Performance Work Statement is as indicated:
1.0       PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
The Contractor shall provide an Organizational and Personal Change Management training program for the U. S. Coast Guard Leadership Development Center.  Training will be provided exclusively at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut.    

2.0	BACKGROUND 

The U. S. Coast Guard Leadership Development Center in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will provide an Executive Development Program with training in personal transition and leading organizational transformation to newly appointed officers appointed to the rank of Rear Admiral (Lower Half) and to new or select civilian Senior Executive Service (SES) employees working within the U.S. Coast Guard or the DHS.  This program will include a three-day executive level course   designed to provide our newly selected flag officers or SES’ with the ability to think strategically and globally to lead themselves and their organization through major periods of transformation and change.  This program will enhance the student’s ability to assess and identify the need and methods for change in both the internal and external environment within their respective agencies.  The goal of the three-day executive level course will be to identify and hone the critical personal skills that are required for leaders to possess in order to be successful in positions of authority. 

3.0	VISION OF EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

The Coast Guard and the DHS require its leaders to master certain key leadership skills (i.e., vision development, change management, etc…) and abilities to enhance their effectiveness as executives in their respective organization.  In order to attain competency in these skills, higher levels of education, specific skill building, and leadership development are required.  The focus of an Executive Development Program is to equip its leaders with the requisite knowledge and abilities to ensure the potential for success.  We envision this program to be a stepping-stone in the individual and collective developmental progress for our newly promoted Admirals and SES’.

4.0	SUMMARY OF THREE-DAY EXECUTIVE LEVEL COURSE

The Executive Development Program is a forward-looking program that prepares the newly appointed flag officers and select SES’ for positions of authority and leadership within the Coast Guard and the DHS.  This three- day executive level, residential course shall help to stretch participants beyond their current capabilities, foster a new sense of trust and interaction with their peers, and seek to challenge personal and organizational assumptions with regard to implementing change at both levels.  A team of faculty experts shall generate a dynamic learning experience that will ultimately prepare Coast Guard and DHS executives to meet the significant challenges of the new department in the twenty-first century.  The goal of the executive level course shall be to identify and hone the critical personal skills that are required for leaders to possess in order to be successful in positions of authority.  It is expected this program may occur annually at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut.

5.0	ATTENDEES OF EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM/COURSE

Attendees of this program and three-day executive level course will be approximately twenty-five (25), newly selected or recently promoted     U. S. Coast Guard officers to the rank of Rear Admiral (Lower Half) and members of the civilian Senior Executive Service from either the U. S. Coast Guard or from other agencies within the DHS.  Many of the students in the program will be transitioning from a senior manager position to an executive level and the commensurate scope and level of responsibilities will increase accordingly.

COURSE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION

6.1 Course Content.  The executive level course designed and implemented under this contract shall include lessons in the following topics:

Leading Organizational Change and Transformation. 

Implementing Personal Change and Transition to include a 360-degree assessment, evaluation, and out processing of results to include an individual or group change implementation-planning session.

This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SK2 Vasylik vasylykd@saipan.navy.mil
