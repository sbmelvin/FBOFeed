<DESC>This program is administered by the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command through the office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP). The objectives of the FY04 CMLRP are to improve (1) the understanding of the basic  science of CML, (2) the diagnosis of CML, (3) the treatment of CML, and (4) the quality of life for individuals and their families living with CML. The intent of the Therapeutic Development Award mechanism is to sponsor the preclinical assessment of therapeutics, as well as the development of tools for the preclinical evaluation in model systems for CML.  The overall goal of this award mechanism is to  allow CML investigators to develop the means to analyze preclinical efficacy of novel and existing agents and/or to generate the preclinical data necessary to conduct clinical trials after completion of the proposed research.  The Therapeutic Development Award is restricted to research in CML.  The proposed studies are expected to be empirical in nature and product driven, but may have a hypothesis-driven approach provided the focus is on therapeutics.  It is anticipated that the agents, model systems, or data generated from these awards will lead to the advancement of therapeutics novel to CML and to the development of a broad platform on which to test future therapies.  The ultimate goal is to significantly move closer to the development of new therapeuti cs for CML. The announcement was released on 18 Feb 2004 with a submission deadline of 27 July 2004, 5:00 pm Eastern Time. Detailed descriptions of this funding mechanism, evaluation criteria, and submission requirements can be found in the FY04 CML Progra m Announcement and can be downloaded from the CDMRP website (http://cdmrp.army.mil).  All applicants will be required to submit one electronic version of their proposal as a PDF file. All documents may be downloaded from the CDMRP website. The website also  contains further information about the CMLRP, CMLRP awardees, previous CMLRP Program Announcements, and other CDMRP-sponsored programs and events. Questions related to the Program, proposal format or required documentation can be addressed to the CDMRP at  301-619-7079, FAX at 301-619-7792 or email at cdmrp.pa@det.amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC (NRL-DC) requires a computer-controlled dual-beam focused ion beam (DB-FIB) milling system for use by researchers in fabrication of nano-scale devices, materials characterization, failure analysis and TEM sample preparation.  Major components of the system are a scanning electron microscope column, a scanning ion-beam column, a vacuum system, a sample stage, detection electronics, gas-injectors for enhanced etching of silicon and silicon-based compounds, metal and insulator deposition.  Both the electron and ion-beam columns require a high-speed electrostatic beam blanker.  Optional items include an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) system, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), software to allow automated milling of the EBSD and EDS tools.  Additional optional items include an integrated sample micromanipulator, a sample intro port to allow introduction of the sample without venting of the main vacuum chamber, an ebeam/ion beam writing attachment for implementation of CAD defined structures and registry to sample alignment marks, and a temperature controlled cryo-stage.  The system will be installed in facilities at the NRL-DC and used by a variety of qualified scientists, engineers and technicians.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price contract and delivery is estimated to be 120 days after the date of contract award.  The NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue RFPs and amendments to RFPs.  Detailed specifications will be included in the solicitation.  The solicitation and any amendments to it will be available via the Internet at the URL address shown below.  Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.

All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for architectural and engineering services and anticipates awarding two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts as a result of this synopsis.  It is anticipated that the maximum quantity required for each contract will be $500,000.  The minimum value the Government will be required to order will be $25,000 and no single order will have a fee in excess of $300,000.  The contractor will be required to provide multi-disciplined design work with an emphasis on the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines.  Design skills must be demonstrated for the following building types: office buildings, industrial warehouses, and general laboratory space.  Typical architectural and engineering support may include the following types of efforts: (a) renovation and replacement of HVAC systems, re-design of water systems (internal to the building), installation and extension of sprinkler systems, installation of restrooms, and installation and retrofitting of elevators in existing buildings;  (b) modification of electrical systems and upgrading existing building power distribution systems;  (c) studies relating to code research, space planning, cost analysis, structural analysis and architectural evaluation;  (d) architectural and structural support services, which may include additions and/or significant renovation of existing spaces or buildings;  (e) demolition of buildings including removal of hazardous materials and assessment of environment concerns.  Asbestos and lead are know to be present, therefore the A&E firm shall identify and provide a design which will accommodate the disposal of these materials in the construction plans and specifications in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.  The first order to be placed under one of the two prospective contracts will be for a design to update the fire protection and sprinkler systems in a complex of five buildings with a combined area of approximately 40,000 square feet.  And, as previously stated hazardous materials may be present, thus the effort should be treated as such.   The first delivery order under the second contract will be to provide an analysis and design of the exhaust systems in two laboratory buildings that have had a change in their utilization of these systems since the buildings were commissioned.  Remediation of hazards will be required.  The NRL will determine which effort will be assigned to either awardee, based on experience and qualifications.  Firms responding to this announcement must do so in accordance with the requirements set forth in Note 24 and the evaluation criteria listed at FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1, which are being presented below in descending order of importance: (1) The contractor shall provide specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical disciplines, and Elevators. This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. The A&E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required. Responding A/E firms must address both of the potential projects. (2) The contractor shall provide professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project.  Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members. If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment.  (3) Each contractor must also provide convincing evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (usually nine weeks for the average projects plus Government review time). It is very important to demonstrate the firms ability juggle workload and to manage a number of projects at one time, such as would be required in an IDIQ type contract environment. (4) The contractor must provide past performance information on contracts with Government agencies and private industry, which demonstrates cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Demonstrating this should include, at a minimum, things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, preferably IDIQ type contracts with multiple orders, the points of contact and phone numbers for references. (5) Contractors will also be evaluated on their location, which typically should be in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Contractors must be sure to include the location of each of the proposed subcontractors. (6) Contractors must provide the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (for the last twelve months).   Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement, and wish to be considered, must respond no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on the response date specified herein.  It is anticipated that the two IDIQ type contracts be awarded as a result of this synopsis will have a period of performance of 24-months from the date each contract is awarded.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541310.  All questions should be directed to the point of contact below.  All interested parties must send one copy of their SF-252 and SF-254, using the mailing address set forth herein, to Contracting Officer, ATTN: Code 3230.MM.

<DESC>The new NASA/USRA Center for Program/Project Management Research has been established to support NASA's Academy for Program and Project Leadership by providing access to the research capabilities of the broader academic community to address the critical management challenges in today's aeronautics and space programs, while also supporting academia's mission in workforce development, conducting cutting edge research, and in the management of university-based projects and programs.  In furtherance of these purposes, the release of the CPMR Research Announcement, PHASE1-RA 04-01, solicits Phase 1 proposals in program and project management research, which will be competitively awarded through a peer review process.  Subsequently, CPMR intends to fund multi-year awards following competitive selection of Phase 2 proposals from successful Phase 1 Principal Investigators (PIs).	Selected PIs will become CPMR Fellows, and will be invited to participate in the full range of Institute activities, thus becoming a repository of knowledge and expertise to assist NASA with its challenging issues in program and project management.  These appointments might also lead to opportunities for personnel exchanges, and other potential collaborations between the CPMR, NASA, and participating organizations.	Given the objectives of the CPMR, eligibility is open to university-led proposals; however, where appropriate, participation from other organizations through teaming arrangements with the PIs is encouraged.   The full text of the Research Announcement, background information on the sponsoring organizations, plus the results of a recent program definition workshop, may be found on the USRA/CPMR website:  http://cpmr.usra.edu/

<DESC>The Interior West Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (IWFIA); Rocky Mountain Research Station; Forest Service, USDA; 507 25th Street; Ogden, UT 84401; requires Outfitter/Guide services (wrangler, riding stock/tack, packing stock/tack, transport, food, and gear) as requested below to visit from 0 to 25 Field Study Locations. Award will be made for the base year, but the Government’s retains the option for the Outfitter/Guide (herein referred to as Contractor) services can be renewed for up to four additional years without competition.

IWFIA performs yearly inventories on forestlands within the Interior West. These inventories provide Congress and other research organizations with detailed information on the health, quality, quantity, and type of forests encountered in this Region.

During the 2004 through 2008 summer field seasons, the IWFIA staff will have several production crews of two or three people each and a quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA) crew of two people working in remote field situations. The work area to be covered consists of northern Montana on the LoLo, Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests (NF).  The contract will be set up through our Ogden IWFIA office.

Wilderness Areas and other roadless or travel-restricted areas comprise a substantial portion of the LoLo, Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests with much of the terrain being very wild, rugged, and remote. Wilderness designation restricts and, in most cases, prohibits the use of aircraft to access remote wilderness locations. Accessing these remote locations and performing IWFIA work would be virtually impossible without the assistance of wilderness guides and pack stock.

<DESC>USAID/Armenia intends to competitively award a contract for Improved Heat Sector Management and Delivery of Heat Supply Program in Armenia.  The goal of the Program is to provide assistance to the Republic of Armenia in implementing the GOAM heat strategy, in particular to demonstrate the full range of heat supply alternatives, e.g., decentralized building and district co-generation, heat-only boilers for apartment blocks, and conversion to direct natural gas, that will be required in addition to central heating rehabilitation and modernization.  USAID support will focus on implementing various alternatives to promote the developing heat market in its ability to realize least cost solutions that enhance effective management and reduce environmental costs.  This Program will involve close collaboration with other donors who will be implementing substantial infrastructure investments and will work to enhance the commercial efficiency of heat suppliers led by the energy service companies who are developing a competitive market for efficient heating.  In combination with strengthened commercial operations for heat companies, the program will active engage to increase public awareness of the benefits from enhanced efficiency and of the need to pay for enhanced quality of service through realistic tariffs.  The Program’s focus will be based in part on the heat sector’s continued need to improve transparency and commercial operations in order both to reduce the opportunities for corruption and to improve the quality of service delivered to customers.  It is also motivated by the contribution more efficient heat supply will make to increase Armenia’s energy security by managing and using scarce resources with greater efficiency and in an environmentally sustainable way.   Improving economic efficiency and ensuring sustainable heat supply also provides an essential element to improve the quality of life for all Armenians.  
Subject to the availability of funds, the program is expected to comprise a base period of four years with an option for one additional year.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Weather Service (NWS), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is posting this Request for Information (RFI) announcement because the NWS anticipates acquiring a number of server platforms for the NWS Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) Backup System currently under development at the NWS Telecommunication Operation Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.  The total number of servers acquired will be determined by the capacity and capability of the units selected. The servers will functionally replicate approximately thirty five (35) IBM RS/6000 UNIX (AIX) servers of varying age, capacity, and capability that comprise the operational infrastructure of the Gateway Server Center (GSC), a subset of the NWSTG.  Functional replication of all applications currently operating on GSC servers is essential to the implementation of the NWSTG Backup System and thereby essential for NWS to achieve critical infrastructure protection.

NWS OCIO is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to achieve functional replication of the GSC servers.  The proposed solutions must support without modification all of the GSC software applications currently executed under the AIX (V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS application to include AFS, IBM EdgeServer, and Sybase. Flexibility through server consolidation and dynamic resource allocation, partitioning, scalability, reliability through fault avoidance, and compactness are also necessary attributes for the optimal solution.  

A complete list of the current servers that must be functionally replicated is attached as Appendix A.  The proposed solution must provide equivalent or better aggregate performance for the servers listed. 

In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring the servers in FY2004, NWS OCIO will utilize established GSA schedules and/or other Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) as appropriate.  

One of the principal outcomes of RFI responses will be to ensure that all viable technical approaches are considered.  NWS OCIO will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy to take into account viable acquisition alternatives. NWS OCIO may conduct one-on-one communications in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.
 
In addition to using the information provided by vendors to assist us in our acquisition strategy, NWS OCIO may also use the information to determine which vendors do not appear to be viable candidates for the eventual acquisition award.  However, if those vendors choose to remain in the competition and later submit proposals, the Team will not be prejudiced by its initial determination.  Any vendor that requests, will receive a written or oral explanation of the Team's initial determination as it pertains to that vendor.  

It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public.  The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its acquisition strategy provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics:

(a) A description of a proposed hardware configuration that provides computational capability and network throughput equivalent to the servers listed in Appendix A.  The description must address how the proposed system will meet NWSTG Backup GSC performance requirements.

(b) A description of the support services which will be provided to install, configure, and maintain the  
	 NWSTG Backup GSC.

(c) A description of the vendor's qualifications for providing the NWSTG Backup GSC (including the extent 
	of subcontracting) and past experience in providing and supporting relevant server systems.

(d) Section 508 compliance information on all proposed systems

(e) Product warranty and maintenance support availability

(f) Statement addressing software compatibility issues given that the proposed solutions must support 
	without modification all GSC software applications developed for and currently executing under the AIX 
	(V4.3/V5.1) operating system as well as currently implemented COTS applications to include AFS, IBM 
	EdgeServer, and Sybase.
						


Interested parties may also submit comments or suggestions in addition to or in lieu of a written approach.  Those comments are welcome, but will not be considered an approach for the purpose of advising vendors as to their viability as candidates for the planned competition.  For the comments/suggestion submission, the vendor is encouraged to provide any comments or recommendations it may have on technology, acquisition strategy, contractual mechanism or other issues that would assist the Team in accomplishing the acquisition. 
  
Vendors responding should provide a point-of-contact, including:  representative's name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.  Written submissions in response to this RFI should not exceed ten (10) pages (including charts and graphs).  Please submit digital copies to the Contracting Officer (William.Voitk@noaa.gov) in either WordPerfect or Word formats. Benchmark results should be summarized in an attachment to the written RFI response, not to exceed four pages.   It is requested for responses to be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Monday, March 22, 2004.  

Responses should be addressed to the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition Management Division, 1305 East West Highway, SSMC4, Room 7504, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attn: Jenista M. Featherstone.  Further information may be obtained by contacting Jenista M. Featherstone at (301) 713-0828 x184, Fax (301) 713-0809, E-Mail at Jenista.M.Featherstone@noaa.gov.  See Note 26.

Note:  Vendors need not respond to this RFI as a prerequisite for participating in the acquisition.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description
The Department of Health and Human Services, National Vaccine Program Office, contemplates single or multiple awards of a contract for a domestically produced, reliable and secure source of cell based monovalent influenza vaccine for use in an influenza pandemic.

Because this could be an issue of health security for any country and that local supplies of influenza vaccine might be reserved for local populations, as an issue of health security the U.S. government is limiting manufacture of the pandemic influenza virus vaccine to domestic sources only.  This would allow the USG to have surge capacity for U.S. citizens in the setting of a global influenza pandemic
 
The following apply:

1.	Documented history of successful development and licensure of a vaccine for human use in the U.S. or Europe is mandatory.
2.	The research and development process and manufacturing facilities needed to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.
3.	The pandemic virus will be a novel strain, such as the avian influenza viruses (H5N1) that infected people in Hong Kong in 1997 and in China in 2003, or the H7N7 strain that caused infections in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2003.

Only written requests, directly from the requestor, will be accepted.  Email requests will be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  Requests should be mailed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ATTN:  Peter Penny, 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3705, Atlanta, GA  30341.  Emails should be sent to Peter Penny at pmp7@cdc.gov.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations - Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation- including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

Public release of information in any white paper/proposal submitted will be subject to existing statutory and regulatory requirements.  If proprietary information which constitutes a trade secret, proprietary commercial or financial informati on, confidential personal information, or data affecting the national security, is provided by an offeror in a white paper/proposal, it will be treated in confidence, to the extent permitted by law, provided that the following legend appears and is complet ed on the front of the white paper/proposal:  'For any purpose other than to evaluate the white paper/proposal, this data shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part, provided that if an  award is made to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the agreement.  This restriction does not limit the right o f the Government to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to this restriction is contained in page(s) _____ of this white paper/proposal.'  Any other legend may be unacceptable to  the Government and may constitute grounds for removing the proposal from further consideration without assuming any liability for inadvertent disclosure.

In addition, the pages indicated as restricted must be marked with the following legend:  'Use or disclosure of the white paper/proposal data on lines specifically identified by asterisk (*) are subject to the restriction on the front page of this white p aper/proposal.'  The Government assumes no liability for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose such data for any purpose.  In the event that properly marked data contained in a white paper/proposal submitted in response to this BAA is requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552, the offeror will be advised of such request and, prior to such release of information, will be requested to expeditiously submit to ARO a detailed listing of all information in the white pape r/proposal which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Act.

By submission of a white paper/proposal, the offeror understands that proprietary information may be disclosed outside the Government for the sole purpose of technical evaluation.  The ARO/RMAC will obtain a written agreement from the evaluator that proprietary information i n the white paper/proposal will only be used for evaluation purposes and will not be further disclosed or utilized.

<DESC>The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has an upcoming competitive acquisition for Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) of Software Services performed on NASA projects.  Software (IV&V) is a systems engineering process employing rigorous methodologies for evaluating the correctness and quality of software products throughout the total software development life cycle.  IV&V services provide for the analysis of the software artifacts, requirements, design, code, and test plan/results of the software to verify and validate the software.  Before IV&V would be performed, under any contracts resulting from this competition, planning and scoping will be performed under a separate contract currently awarded to Performance Results Corporation of Morgantown, WV.  That contractor examines project requirements in detail to identify IV&V software modules that are critical to NASA mission success.  Planning and scoping functions, therefore, are outside the scope of this upcoming competition for IV&V of Software Services.   GSFC is hereby requesting information from potential business sources that possess the capability to actually perform IV&V services.  In addition to the key objectives of IV&V described above, the requirements provide for increased software safety and quality, reduced software costs, and improved delivery time through early detection and resolution of errors.  IV&V assures that software risks are identified, managed, and understood. Sources need to possess the capability to provide programmatic and technical support for these activities. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the FedBizOps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  The anticipated date for the release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is May 5, 2004, with a final RFP release date of June 21, 2004, followed by a proposal due date of August 6, 2004.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or future synopses. Interested businesses having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement are invited to submit a capability statement indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.	The capability statement should describe the current or projected status of your company's ISO 9000/CMM/CMMI-compliance and/or certification.   In addition, responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned. NASA is seeking capabilities from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) has a requirement to support the Navy’s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program for academic and simulator training on the C-20A/D aircraft.  Currently, this requirement is being performed by FlightSafety International under Contract N61339-01-D-1004 and is due to expire on 30 April 2004.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD plans to award a contract modification on a sole source basis to FlightSafety International to extend the C-20A/D portion of contract N61339-01-D-1004.  This extension will be for twenty-five (25) months of contract performance, for the period 01 May 2004 through 31 May 2006, and will conform to the same period of performance for other CACT training under the contract.  By this extension, the Navy aligns the C20A/D portion of the contract with the existing training due to expire on 31 May 2006.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, Section U.S.C, 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This action will ensure continuity of services to avoid any impact to current and future readiness of our Fleet and to avoid substantial duplication of effort that would be required to support the re-development of C20A curriculum and training course development expended to this point.  FlightSafety International is the only responsible source that possesses the corporate knowledge and expertise necessary to maintain this level of continuity beginning on 1 May 2004.  

A brief description of the C-20A/D training requirements follow.  The specific individual courses required include:  C-20A/D Pilot and Crew Chief Initial Training Course, C-20A/D Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training Course, C-20A/D Pilot and Crew Chief Initial Differences Training Course, C-20A/D Maintenance Initial Training Course, C-20A/D Maintenance Recurrent Training Course, and C-20A/D Maintenance Manager Training Course.  The following individual non-aircraft specific International Procedures training courses are required:  Pilot Initial International Procedures Training and Pilot Refresher International Procedures Training.  The C-20A/D pilot courses listed above must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Gulfstream III aircraft at time of training.  Training includes providing all the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  These C-20A/D CACT program training courses require classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability, and a C-20A/D, Level “C” flight simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT, a higher order device may be used.  A training syllabus for each course shall be submitted for government approval.  C-20A/D training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification. 

This synopsis is issued to provide notice of NAVAIR Orlando TSD’s intent to award this contract modification on a sole source basis to FlightSafety International; THEREFORE, NO SOLICITATION WILL RESULT FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Questions or comments concerning this requirement should be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Roxy Campos, via email at roxy.campos@navy.mil or facsimile at (407) 380-4742 no later than 3 March 2004 for consideration.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Co-Site UHF/SATCOM Receive Filters/ Co-Site UHF SATCOM Transmit Filters/ Co-Site UHF Line of Sight Transmit/Receive Filters
<DESC>This is a sole source combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Government intends to solicit (under N00421-04-R-0056), negotiate and issue a firm fixed-price contract to Pole/Zero Corp., 5530 Union Centre Dr., West Chester, OH 45069, 513-870-9060 X130 under the authority of FAR 6-302-1 “Only One Responsible Source” for the procurement of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed below.  The listed items will support the Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS) Project being supported by the Special Communications Requirements Division (SCRD) located at NAWCAD St. Inigoes, MD.  The filters are required to fulfill the functional requirement of in-band radio operation; providing harmonic and spurious suppression to allow simultaneous operation of co-located ARC-210 (domestic variant) radios.  Operation without the use of these filters will result in the desensitization of the receiver end of the radio, rendering it inoperable and preventing mission-critical communication in the field.  Due to the sensitivity of military frequency hopping algorithms, the manufacturing of co-site filters for the ARC-210 radio is very limited.  Only the Pole/Zero co-site UHF SATCOM filters meet the RRSVS users’ operational requirement of an in-band (vice not passive) co-site solution for the domestic variant of the ARC-210 radio.  Pole/Zero is the sole manufacturer and supplier of the specific co-site UHF SATCOM filter models.

The applicable NAICS is 517910 and the small business size standard is $12.5 M.  Award is expected to be 30 MARCH 2004.  All items shall be delivered to Receiving Officer, NAWCAD; Bldg. 8115, Villa Rd.; St. Inigoes, MD 20684-0010.  All CLINs shall be delivered within 12 months of contract placement. Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination. The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard warranty normally offered in a similar sale. Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government’s rights under the Inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government’s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty. The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverable listed in the schedule. 

This sole source synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and business size. Proposal along with completed representations and certifications is due to Pat Riley, Contract Specialist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Building 8110, Unit 11, Villa Road, St. Inigoes, Maryland 20684-0010 by 3:30 P.M.

<SUBJECT>S -- Utility Infrastructure Services - Request for Information/Sources Sought (US Air Force Academy)
<DESC>Utility Infrastructure Services – Request for Information/Sources Sought.  The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) on behalf of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is seeking sources that are capable and interested in participating in privatization of the USAFA utility distribution infrastructure.  The purpose of this announcement is two fold:  1) to ascertain if there is a viable interest from industry in participating; and 2) to ascertain if any of the privatization solicitations can be set aside for a) small business, b) 8a small business or c) HUBZone small business.  Decisions will be made by GSA and USAFA on a utility-by-utility basis.  If viable interest is not shown for a particular utility system, a solicitation for that utility will not be issued.  North American Industrial Classification Codes of 221122 (Electric Power Distribution), 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution), 221310 (Water Supply Systems) and 221320 (Sewer Treatment Facilities) apply.  Corresponding small business size standards are 4 million megawatts, 500 employees, $6M in sales, and $6M in sales, respectively.  Parties interested in acquiring utility systems and providing utility distribution services at USAFA should provide a separate statement of interest for each utility.  Each separate statement of interest shall identify the specific system(s) for which there is interest and for which industry provides separate responses to the questions identified below.  Firms that are either small business or 8a or HUBZone small business need to identify that fact and indicate in which of the three listed small business categories they qualify. The USAFA utilities involved are electricity; natural gas; water; and wastewater (collection, treatment and non-potable water distribution).    If an offeror is interested in multiple systems, separate responses should be provided for each system.  In addition, interested parties are required to provide information regarding experience and qualifications for operating utility systems for each of the systems of interest.  Contractor selection will NOT be made on the basis of information submitted, rather we will decide if sufficient viable interest exists to warrant issuing RFPs or if any limitation of participation to small business, 8a or HUBZone small business applies.  Each utility system will be separately solicited.  Please be advised the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) apply to this procurement and interested parties should reference the draft Request For Proposal (RFP) template at the following website for information regarding terms and conditions.  The draft template RFP can be found at http://www.afcesa.af.mil/Directorate/CEO/Contracts/UtilPrivatization/UPTemplates.htm.  Specifically, parties are advised the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1, Alt I, found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm will apply when the entity is providing services where the rates are not set by law or regulation and acknowledge understanding that acceptance of this clause is required to be considered responsive to any subsequent RFP.  Responses will be used to assist in refining the acquisition strategy and subsequent decisions regarding future issuance of a full and open competitive RFP, a set-aside RFP, a sole source RFP, or, if no viable interest, not issuing an RFP.  If viable responses are not received, the Government has the discretion to determine no market interest exists and no subsequent RFPs be issued (again, on a utility-by-utility basis). Specific responses to the following are needed in order for your firm to be considered “viable” in providing an offer for services under this program. Provide: (1) System of interest: (a) Electric Utility Distribution System; (b) Natural Gas Utility Distribution System; (c) Potable Water Utility Distribution System; (d) Wastewater Utility Distribution System; (2) Your status regarding your authority to support this service: (a) Regulated utility and service is within certificated area of service; (b) Regulated utility providing nonregulated service for this area of service; (d) Regulated utility and service is not within certificated area of service; (e) Non-regulated utility for the service of interest; (3) Classification of your company: (a) Publicly owned utility; (b) Investor owned utility; (c) Cooperative owned utility; (d) Publicly owned and traded company – not a utility; (e) Privately owned company; (f) Limited Liability Corporation; (g) C-Corp; (h) Other, Please Describe; (4) Offeror acknowledges acceptance of application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation terms and conditions included in the RFP template. (5) Acknowledgement that you may be required to comply with the Cost Accounting Standards; (6) If you propose to provide nonregulated service within your proposed service area, will your entity accept the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1 Alt 1;  (7) Indicate if your firm or entity is or is not a small business, or 8a or HUBZone small business.  (Not-for-profit entities cannot be a small business.)  - Responses that indicate insufficient capabilities will not be further considered.  Offeror is put on notice that the government anticipates making a best value source selection where past performance and a strong financial balance sheet will be significantly more important than price. 

Descriptions of Utility Infrastructure Systems – The Air Force Academy (AFA) is located north of the city limits of Colorado Springs, CO.  There are 18,455 acres of land  within the AFA boundaries at an average elevation of  6,700 feet above sea level.  The electric, natural gas and water distribution systems and wastewater collection system are being considered for privatization.  The utility system information provided here is an estimate only and is subject to change.  Electrical System:  The City of Colorado Springs provides and wheels power to two substations owned by the AFA.  The City owns and operates the 34.5kV overhead lines and equipment in the substations.  The AFA owns and operates the 34.5kV - 12.47kV substation transformers and all 12.47kV distribution equipment.  The 12.47kV equipment at the substation is metal-clad switchgear.  The electrical distribution system consists of 14 feeders in concrete encased duct banks with selection and interrupt switches located in manholes and transformer vaults.  Most transformers are double-ended unit substation type (dry or oil-filled) in vaults within the buildings.  Pad-mounted transformers are used in housing, commercial, and industrial areas.  Overhead single-phase lines serve remote facilities.  Natural Gas System:  The natural gas distribution system consists of a network of approximately 189,000 lineal feet of coated and wrapped steel ranging in size from 1 to 14 inches in diameter cathodically protected by three-deep anode bed systems with rectifier units. Recent extensions have used polyethylene piping.   The City of Colorado Springs supplies natural gas at 50 psig through a single metering station east of Interstate 25.  The 50 psig distribution piping is protected with galvanic anodes.  There are 11 pressure regulating valve pits within the Military Family Housing (MFH) areas  where the gas pressure is reduced to 15 psig for further distribution.  The 15 psig piping is protected by sacrificial anodes. The gas pressure is reduced to a few ounces by individual regulators at each building such as residencies in the MFH areas.  Meters and regulators will be included with the privatization effort.  Water System:  The potable water distribution system consists of approximately 283,000 lineal feet of water mains  ranging in size from 4 to 24 inches.  All potable water is purchased from the City of Colorado Springs and stored in the AFA's five underground reservoirs, which have a total storage capacity of approximately 4.2 million gallons.  A chlorinating system is located at each reservoir.  The system was originally installed during 1958-1960.  The underground piping systems are protected against external corrosion with cathodic protection.  Wastewater System:  The AFA owns and operates a wastewater system consisting of a collection system, a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and a non-potable water distribution system.  The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 330,000 lineal feet of  vitrified clay, reinforced concrete, cast iron, and PVC pipe ranging in diameter from  4 to 21 inches.  There are three lift stations which have backup power generators.  The wastewater treatment plant is a 2.0-MGD activated sludge plant operating at approximately 1.0 to 1.4 MGD.  The WWTP 30-day average biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids limits are 25 and 10 respectively with varying seasonal discharges to nearby Monument Creek.  The WWTP consists of preliminary, primary, and secondary treatments, filtration, disinfection, and sludge handling.  The wastewater system also includes a nonpotable water distribution system consisting of four surface reservoirs and four pump stations.  The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.

Due date for response is 04 March 2004.  Responses should be addressed to:  Linda L.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is issued to answer questions received in response to this solicitation.  Closing date and time for receipt of proposals is NOT extended and remains 19 February 2004, 2:00 pm, MST. Q1a:  We are a pre-qualified contractor.  A question about our cost submittal for this solicitation:  Is there a form to fill out or are you accepting regular simple email solicitations stating something like we will do this project for $xxx.? and  Q1b:  We are a pre-qualified contractor preparing a quote in response to the above mentioned solicitation.  Would you please let me know if you require anything more than a Scope of Work, cost proposal, and Representations and Certifications to be submitte d in response to this solicitation. A1:    There is no standard form that must be filled out.  Pre-qualifed contractors need to submit a Scope of Work, cost proposal, and completed Offeror and Representations.  Contractors who are not prequalified need to submit all of the above, plus a pre- qualification package by the closing date and time of this solicitation.  That closing date and time is 19 February 2004, 2:00 pm, MST.   Q2:  We are submitting several reports for our prequalification, and was wondering if the prequal package also needs to be submitted electronically in Word, or can we overnight our prequal package to you in a hard format?    A2:  You can submit your prequal package either electronically or in hard copy  format.  Regardless of the method of submittal, it must be here, along with your quote, by the closing date and time of the solicitation. Q3:  1.2 States the normal hours of operation are Mon through Thurs.  You must submit a request for work other than these at least 24 hours in advance.  Will we be able to survey the whole week  Mon through Sun?  Or just the normal hours of operation?  It will make a difference in our cost estimate.   A3:  Our normal work hours are Mon through Thurs.  40 hours per week, normally 6:00 am until 4:30 pm.  If survey time outside of this schedule is requested then a 24 hour notice must be submitted in order for us to determine if access to the area is availa ble.  Yes, if approved, you may survey Mon through Sun,  but we will not increase the contract amount to pay any overtime costs you may owe your employees as a result.     Q4:  What permits will be needed?  We already have ASM & BLM permits, but will there be any permits for YPG.  We would like to apply for them early on.   A4: No permits other than the ASM permit. YPG has no internal permits. Q5:  Is an MA needed for the Project Director?  If so, will other experience and qualifications substitute?    A5:  A MA is required for the Project Director.  Crew Chief must have a BA anthropology/archaeology and work experience as detailed in the prequalification factors.  Experience and education requirements are found in AR 200-4 and PAM 200-4 which in turn ar e based on the Secretary of the Interiors Standards and Guidelines.  The Minimum Qualifications document will be posted on our USAYPG website at:  http://143.84.169.6/contracting/rfq.html#04-T-0017.   Q6:  How long is the review and comment period for YPG once our draft report is turned in?  A6:  45 days Q7:  Are milestone payments available? A7:  Yes, a milestone payment schedule may be negotiated. Q8:  5.4.1 says data shall be in ASCII format.  Is this referring to GIS data, and what exactly is ASCII?    A8:  ASCI refers to the entire document.  A definition of ASCI is:  ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or ' @' or an action of some sort.  If someone says they want your work in ASCII format, all this means is they want plain text with no formatting such as tabs, bold or underscoring - the raw format that any computer can understand. This is usually so they can easily import the file into their ow n applications without issues. Notepad.exe creates ASCII text, or in MS Word you can save a file as text only. Q9:  We are submitting several reports for our prequalification, and was wondering if the prequal package also needs to be submitted electronically in Word, or can we overnight our prequal package to you in a hard format?    A9:  You can submit your prequal package either electronically or in hard format.  It does need to be here, along with your quote, by the closing date and time of the solicitation. Q10:  Where can we locate a map of the area to be surveyed?   A10:  A map of the area and a copy of the solicitation are available on our website at: http://143.84.169.6/contracting/rfq.html#04-T-0017 Q11:  I did not see reference to FAR clause 52.222-41, Service Contract Act  Wage Determination for Solicitation W9124R-04-T-0017, and wanted to  double check that it does not apply to this solicitation.   A11:  FAR 52.222-41 Service Contract Act Wage Determination does not apply to this acquisition.
