Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW) and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than price.  The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness.  

It is the Government’s intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.
 
Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001-0003; Quantity:  1 each; 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  CLIN 0001-0003; Quantity:  1 each; 30 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: 0001-0003; Quantity: 1 Ea.; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Acceptance will be by the ICMC Facility in Baghdad, Iraq.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 0001 TO SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION RFQ W914NS-04-Q- 0199:

1) Is there a preference of hardware suppliers for the PCs?
A: No preference on hardware vendor (reliable vendors with good support are desired).

2) We would like to pre-configure the hardware and have burn in tests done before we deploy to Baghdad.
A: Pre-configuration is acceptable.

3) Regarding the tight delivery timeframe what happens if hardware is not available in a sufficient amount of time? Can we swap to other available hardware?
A:  There is no hardware available in-country; hardware will have to be from an acceptable vendor.

4) Is it correct that we only install one system in Baghdad and the other two systems are handed over with training to be deployed in the other two destinations?
A: One system will be installed in Baghdad.  The others will go to regional offices (probably Mosul and Basra).

5) Is the power supply sufficiently stable to operate PCs or do we need to provide hardware for this too?
A: Vendor should offer UPS with delivered system.  Facility should have capability to provide stable power and handle major outages.

6) Is it possible to access broadband internet, so that the system that is currently running can be demonstrated?
A: Yes; demonstrating a currently running system may be done prior to delivery by the successful contractor.

7) Are Virage/Idioma in any way preferred or is this open to other solutions? 
A: Open to other solutions that meet the requirement.

8) How long should the complaints archive be available?
A: Mandatory archiving period to be determined by ICMC licensing; presently, broadcasters required to maintain 30-day archives of output.

9) Do advertising, election or broadcast violations need to be auto-detected or is this done according to monitoring activities (key word search, complaint, etc?) 
A: Auto-detection and auto-indexing could help if the number of available analysts are lower than anticipated/planned, particularly during election campaign period.  Monitoring activities otherwise to be reactive rather than prescriptive/pro-active.   

10) Can voice samples be made available for the people that are of interest for the observers?
A: Direct voice samples unlikely; however, samples could be made from recorded output. Generally though, monitoring more likely to be based around grid (specific programmes, news bulletins etc) rather than target personalities.  

11) How many Analysts will access the system and do they need dedicated PCs from us or do they have existing PCs that we could configure for usage (Java for Internet Explorer and Real Media Player would need to be installed).
A: Difficult to ascertain at present time; ICMC management has option of determining full scope of monitoring activities. Number of analysts also likely to fluctuate (e.g. during election campaign period). Likely strength around 10 personnel. Numbers of PCs should be factored into total ICMC hardware requirements.     

12) How many of the 20 Stations are radio and how many TV?
A:  Likely ratio 15 TV, 5 radio.

All other terms and conditions remains the same.  The closing date of the RFQ remains unchanged.
