<DESC><p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ISSUED ONLY TO CONDUCT A MARKET RESEARCH STUDY FOR AN ANTICIPATED PROCUREMENT.
<p>PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to assess the interest and qualifications of large AND small business firms, including Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns, Certified 8(a) Small Business Concerns and Certified HUBZone Small Business Concerns, in competing for a contract for an anticipated procurement entitled "INTEGRATED COMMERCIAL INTRUSTION DETECTION SYSTEM (ICIDS) Monitoring, Maintenance, Repair, Administration, Survey and Installation at Fort Lewis, Yakima Training Center and McChord Air Force Base, Washington." The information attained from this sources sought will be reviewed by the Government and used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy. <br />PROJECT INFORMATION: This anticipated project is currently slated as a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement to be conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15. The estimated performance period of the contract will include a one-year base period with the option to extend for four (4) additional one-year option periods.

Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA. A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business (SDVOSB) prime contractor can subcontract part of a SDVOSB contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other SDVOSBs. A joint venture of at least one SDVOSB and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVOSB procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. A qualified Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone) prime contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone small business concerns. A joint venture of two or more qualified HUBZone small business concerns may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone. Further information regarding teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125). <br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT: If you are a Prime Contractor and your firm can meet all of the requirements identified under PROJECT INFORMATION for this anticipated procurement, please respond to this sources sought notice by providing ALL of the following information: (1) Name of your firm, to include address, phone, fax, e-mail address, and point of contact information.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND INDUSTRY COMMENT

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH to locate commercial firms that either sell commercial products or services, or are capable of developing such, that can verify the identity of SSA’s online customers. NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. 

BACKGROUND
SSA handles approximately 53 million e-Service transactions yearly.  This number will increase significantly over the next decade. To facilitate electronic business processes, SSA has developed an E-Authentication strategy that recognizes the risk of fraudulent use of new electronic processes and improper disclosure. Proper security controls and more robust e-authentication routines will provide reliable and accurate outcomes for citizens, businesses and other government agencies, which rely upon SSA applications. SSA seeks information on vendors able to provide authentication technology solutions in the areas of Identity Proofing, Risk-Based Authentication, and Out-of-Wallet Data in support of SSA’s E-Authentication strategy. Vendor solutions must be able to integrate with and support SSA customer-facing applications, as well as support customer registration and subsequent authentication events consistent with SSA’s E-Authentication strategy.   

SSA is interested in highly-reliable, adaptive solutions that will meet all technical and operational requirements specified below and within the draft statement of work (see attached). 

Any potential vendor solution must support:

&#61607;	Seamless Integration within the SSA authentication framework utilizing secure, open standards in order to reduce the impact of solution implementation upon SSA and its customers;
&#61607;	Identity Proofing: the e-authentication process by which an assertion of an identity is verified;
&#61607;	Risk-Based Authentication: a technique that uses both contextual and historical user information, along with data supplied during an Internet transaction, to assess authenticity of a user interaction; and
&#61607;	Out-of-Wallet Data: refers to private data used for authentication activities, e.g., any personal information that cannot be found in a person’s wallet. “Out-of-wallet” data may be drawn from public, publicly available and non-public proprietary databases. A typical out-of-wallet question may be based on information taken from a credit report, such as the name of the company that issued your home loan.

Any potential vendor solution must adhere to the following federal security guidelines that support strong Level 3 identity proofing.

&#61607;	National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Special Publication (SP) 800-63
&#61607;	Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M 04 04

INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES

Interested and capable parties are invited to submit information in response to this notice.. All responses must include the following information in their responses:

&#61607;	A description of how the solution satisfies SSA’s technical requirements. This description must include the factors, elements, and process used to generate a risk score in support of the Risk-Based Authentication requirements;

&#61607;	A description of how the solution will integrate with SSA systems, while conforming to applicable standards, transports, and protocols described within this solicitation;

&#61607;	A description of how the solution’s performance, security, and reliability will be monitored, maintained, reported, and potentially improved to satisfy SSA requirements;

&#61607;	An general project plan that defines how the general levels of effort required on the vendor’s part to implement the solution, the estimated duration to implement the solution, the types of key personnel required to implement and maintain the solution, and a description of the anticipated level SSA personnel’s involvement in implementing and maintaining the solution.

&#61607;	Any additional relevant information on quality assurance, warranties, or guarantees of performance of the solution.

&#61607;	A comprehensive list of Out-of-Wallet questions the vendor will employ that is sufficient to verify identity during the authentication process. 

&#61607;	A clear description of how the will provide access to information that supports authentication requirements specified within NIST 800-63, such as address and financial information [e.g., credit card numbers, banking account numbers (checking, savings), loan information (home, car, student)]. SSA seeks evidence of a vendor’s ability to deliver the broadest range of identity verification data to support the authentication of a highly diverse customer base.

&#61607;	A description of how the vendor’s solution is commonly sold I the commercial marketplace (e.g., initial price approaches, user license based, transaction based recurring pricing, price policies for solution maintenance, hourly or engagement based services pricing). Vendors should also indicate whether their services/products are available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), and if applicable provide the relevant contract numbers.   

&#61607;	Examples of relevant corporate past performance information that demonstrates the vendor’s previous success in delivering solutions of similar size, scope, and complexity in the government or commercial marketplace.


Vendors are invited to submit complete responses to this notice and make advisory comment on the attached draft statement of work document. Vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by the Government.
