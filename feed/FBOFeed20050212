<CONTACT>Charles  Clements, Support Contractor, Phone 703-343-9218, Email charles.clements@cpa-iq.org
<DESC>This is a pre-solication notice.  The Joint Contracting Command-Iraq, fromerly known as the Project and Contracting Officer has a requirement to secure the services of an architectural and engineering firm to design the Al Mamoon Exchange and Telecommunications Center in Baghdad, Iraq.

Baghdad Telecommunications plans to build what will become the new heart of its operation Al Mamoon exchange and telecommunication center; a central office building, a post office, a parking structure, and a plaza. The office building will cater to the needs of the Exchange and Telecommunication Authority combined departments and associated activities; Administration and Accounting Departments, Planning & Operation Department, Engineering Department, Switching and Maintenance Department, Wireless and Mobile Department, and a Traffic Control Department. 
The Post office will serve as one of Baghdad’s  downtown central offices, and the parking structure will be designed to accommodate 250 regular parking spaces, 10 spaces for postal vans, and 2 spaces for delivery trucks with loading facilities, and the plaza will connect the structures with each other and with the district.
The Telecommunication authority desire its new building to utilize the maximum height allowed at the site by the Civil Aviation and Baghdad Municipality. Thus, the height of the Building is expected to be higher than the existing buildings in the vicinity of Baghdad Central.  The Building will be topped by steel Mast to mount Telecom Antennae encased in I.M.D.S.F. Radome.
 
The desired office building should include a type of service core that allows a combination of large office spaces, also affords the opportunity for developing small secluded spaces for private offices. The circulation plan should conform and complements the predominant work flow requirements. The final office building space program and the exact area requirements for the different offices shall be finalized with SPCO in coordination with the Exchange and Telecommunication Authority departments heads and employees at the preliminary design stage.

The Al Mamoon Telecommunication Center is envisioned as Iraq’s new communication hub that will represent the new Iraq, where a government agency is demonstrating its ability to serve the citizen with dignity and transparency. The post office will bring needed services to the city center, and the parking garage will add convenience in accessibility. The new office building will be the place where one comes, alone or as a group to conduct communication business, learn about future exchange ideas and opportunities. Thus, The design of the building should generate a place for agency employees and staff to conduct an efficient operation with large open work spaces, private offices, conference rooms, exhibit hall, cafeteria, and a large hall for lectures and public seminars. The building should be environmentally responsive and demonstrably comfortable in both summer and winter.

The building will act as a symbolic place which shall reflect the communication center identity, dynamism and development, the progressive role it plays within Iraq, as well as its connection with the global community. The building should definitely stand out as one of Baghdad’s new urban landmarks reflecting state of the art in both architecture and engineering.

The existing project site is located on the 14 of Ramadan Street, at Baghdad’s city center. Existing on the site are two (2) partially destroyed buildings that will be demolished to make room for the new construction.  All infrastructure services exist on the site, such as telephone service, ducts/lines/manholes/etc, drainage lines/manholes/traps/etc, water lines/meters/valves/etc power cables/ducts/panels/etc are to be shifted beyond the new building area and are to be maintained uninterrupted by the construction activities during the execution of the project. Power supply, drainage, water supply and irrigation facilities / net works/systems shall be upgraded / modified  / redesigned to allow for provision of such services to the whole installations within the plot area inclusive of the new building as well as all other remaining buildings.

The new construction will consist of a Telecommunication office building, a post office, a parking structure, and a plaza that connect the three new structures with each other, and with the existing district.

The estimated project cost is $24,000,000.00.

It is the intent of the Contracting Officer to post the Request for Proposal on or about 28 Febraury 2005.

The alternate point-of-contract is Captain Fred J. Lacey, IV.
