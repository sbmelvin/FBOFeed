<DESC>The Agricultural Research Service, USMARC, in Clay Center, NE, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures with BioTeam, Inc., 7 Derosler Drive, Middleton, MA 01949, for the customization of MiniLIMS - a semantic web based laboratory information management system. The project involves the development of MiniLIMS for managing and integrating data and metadata (including sample provenance and output from bioanalytical instrumentation) associated with samples to be sequenced on Roche 454 and PacBio DNA sequencers, creating microbial genome assemblies from the output of the sequencers, and automatically annotating and submitting these assembled annotated microbial genomes to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank in a form acceptable for inclusion into their public database. The system shall be built upon open source components such that the code can be used, modified or enhanced by ARS without permission or the purchase of software licenses. The contractor must demonstrate experience designing laboratory information systems that support state-of-the-art DNA sequencing in a research environment. Special skills and experience required include custom specification and integration of hardware and software for running bioinformatic applications on in-house distributed resource management systems (e.g Oracle Grid Engine, Condor, Platform LSF) or on cloud based systems such as the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) should these resources be required for genome assembly and annotation. The contractor shall install the MiniLIMS, customize the system as specified for managing genomic research projects, creating forms, and train staff on its use and customizations. Additional modifications to accommodate future experimental designs and alternative types of data may be required on an optional basis. BioTeam is considered a unique source and is most familiar with the existing code for customizing MiniLIMS to meet ARS needs. Additionally, the firm is a Pacific Biosciences Devnet partner and possesses the necessary experience and science/IT capability required to install, modify, and extend the MiniLIMS code as required by ARS. <br />The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b), only one source is reasonably available and no other supplies or service will satisfy Agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519, with a small business size standard of $25.0 million, is applicable. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored. This is a best value procurement and the criteria will be price, technical acceptability, and past performance. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualifications fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit responses to US Meat Animal Research Center, State Spur 18D, PO Box 166, Clay Center, NE 68933<br />

All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this RFI/Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with RFI/Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to modify the current single-source contract with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC).

<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide FAA management and executive leadership training instructional support services.  The market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA 8(a) certified small businesses.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine the FAA's acquisition strategy for the prospective contract requirement.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA intends to establish an instructional services contract by August 2012.
Potential sources of these services are expected to be categorized in the Sector 611430 of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

The Small Business size standard for NAICS 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training) is $7.0 Million dollars.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  When a Request for Proposal is issued the FAA may decide to issue the Screening Information Request for full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Terhune, Contracting Officer

<a href="mailto:elizabeth.terhune@va.gov">Elizabeth Terhune, Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The intent of this notice is to inform the contracting community that the Government intends to enter into a sole source contract for services to "Upgrade Nurse Call" at the Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Center with South Western Communications (SWC), 4871 Rosebud lane, Newburgh IN 47630 to install a new Rauland Nurse Call System as described herein:  The Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Centers located in Indianapolis has the following requirement; to Install a new nurse call system for the following areas:  Basement Radiation Oncology and PET/CT Clinic, 1st Floor PV, Dopplar, Podiatry, ENT, and Dental Clinics, 2nd Floor Eye Clinic and Hematology Onocology Clinic, and 4th Floor Pain Clinic to match existing nurse call in the rest of the facility.  

The Medical Center recently activated the new 7th and 8th floors that included installation of a new Rauland Nurse Call System.  The medical center's goal is to have the same standard of care throughout the entire facility, and as a result, the nurse call system was upgraded facility-wide to be capable of integrating with the new areas.  A further expansion of  The Rauland system is necessary to include  other areas that will result in a fully integrated and singular nurse communication system.  The purpose of an integrated facility-wide nurse call system is that if a nurse or other staff travels outside of their care area and a call is initiated, that care giver will still receive the call and can respond accordingly.  The nurse call system shall continue to be the Rauland Nurse Call System to insure full interoperability with the existing Rauland Nurse Call System. SWC, who installed the system on the 7th and 8th floors and throughout the rest of the medical center, is the only local authorized distributor and installer of the Rauland Nurse Call System.
  
The installation of the Rauland Nurse Call System was a full and open competition procurement for the activation of the 7th and 8th floors of this facility.  SWC was the contractor awarded that contract, they are the only local licensed installer and distributer of the Rauland system.  During that procurement cycle three contractors submitted proposals and were evaluated.  The Rauland system was selected.  The FY10 facility-wide ARRA nurse call installation project was also bid out and was awarded to SWC because the competing companies were not able to provide an integrated solution to insure full interoperability and none are licensed to install the Rauland System.

The Rauland Nurse Call System is the only system that will allow for full interoperability with all components of the existing nurse call, including the pocket pagers, wireless phones, tracer tags, and patient locator.  Introducing another manufacturer's phone or resource location system would cause frequency interference with the currently installed systems.  The current nurse call system has been approved to interface with our VA LAN.  Other systems have not been approved and are not guaranteed that they could be connected to the VA LAN.  

As a result, the government intends to award a contract to South Western Communications (SWC) for these services on a sole source basis. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), agencies are permitted to utilize this authority contingent upon a reasonable basis existing that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued; a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued via Federal Business Opportunities. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government shall consider all proposals and information received by 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time January 26, 2011. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is a viable option.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries shall be accepted. Information can be sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs, R.L. Roudebush VAMC, 1481 W. 10th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202. Attn: Elizabeth Terhune (90CSC).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with AB Sciex LLC in Wilmington, DE for the purchase of software to upgrade the existing software package and system capabilities for the existing AB Sciex 4000 Q-trap system.
<p>A software upgrade for the existing AB Sciex 4000 Q-trap system is required in order to perform identification of unknown proteins from human samples based on data acquired using AB Sciex proprietary software. ProteinPilot allows for protein identification and quantification enabling the identification of hundreds of peptide modifications and non-tryptic cleavages simultaneously; easily distinguish protein isoforms, protein subsets, and suppress false positives; and visualize peptide-protein associations and relationships. ProteinPilot also allows for the automatic file formatting and searching of the MASCOT database in order to identify proteins from other primary sequence databases. These increased capabilities will assist in clinical proteomics research. <br /><br />AB Sciex is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the existing 4000 Q-trap system, the proprietary data acquisition software (Analyst), and for the proprietary ProteinPilot software. AB Sciex is the only source capable of providing the software necessary for the database searching and automatic file formatting using data collected on the 4000 Q-trap instrumentation. The procurement of this upgrade software will allow NIST to comply with certain aspects of the quality system and allow for an increased capability for certification efforts.</p>

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Dolores Jablecki, 5649 Morning Glory Trail, New Market, Maryland 21774-7018, to provide human resource consulting services.
<p>The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-CSB-(AR)-2011-055-CRS.</p>
<p>The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 921190.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is in the process of restructuring its Human Resources (HR) staff. Consequently, many HR staff are being reassigned to new positions, and as a result, many services are being centralized while the number of HR employees assigned to provide services to each Institute is being greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based upon the fact that Delores Jablecki is familiar with the DHHS/NIH/NIAMS Human Resource Policies and can complete work on several areas of the Work and Family Policy at NIAMS.

She is the point of contact and the liaison for NIAMS staff regarding personnel concerns. NIAMS is depending on Mrs. Jablecki to work closely with the NIAMS Directors, supervisors, and staff on various DHHS/NIH/NIAMS HR policies and procedures. NIAMS has a critical need for Ms. Jablecki's services to complete work on several areas of the Work and Family Policy here at NIAMS and other HR related tasks. There is a critical need for her services in order to continue to provide basic human resource services that NIAMS employees require.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), leads the Federal effort on research into: the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases, the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research, and the dissemination of information on research progress to improve public health. NIAMS supports, and conducts, basic clinical and epidemiologic research training, to universities and medical centers throughout the Nation, as well as through the Intramural Research Program at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, focusing on diseases affecting millions of Americans. In order to meet the needs of NIAMS, The Office of the Director (OD) of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), must contract with Mrs. Jablecki, who is an experienced HR Consultant with a strong background in Human Resources who is familiar with the DHHS/NIH policies in order to provide services to our employees.</p>

<p>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. FAR Part 6 - Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular, FAC 05-48.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 334516, with size standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p>Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the sole / single source reference, is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein.</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Andor Technology, 425 Sullivan Ave Suite 3, South Windsor, Connecticut 06074-3783, to provide an EM-CCD camera for a single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscope.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in a proposaldevelopment activity that addresses the technical objectives and development of aninstrument in response to an anticipated Earth Venture Class Investigation Announcementof Opportunity (AO) expected to be released in the Spring of 2011.  Earth Venture is aProgram element within the Earth System Science Pathfinder Program (ESSP) consisting of aseries of new science-driven, competitively selected, low cost missions that will provideopportunity for investment in innovative Earth science to enhance our capability tobetter understand the current state of the Earth system and to enable continualimprovement in the prediction of future changes. The focus of the investigations is toenable innovation in measurement and observation, demonstrate innovative ideas andhigher-risk technologies, establish new research avenues, and demonstrate keyapplication-oriented measurements. For additional information on the Venture Classprogram visithttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={B94FE9A7-CF32-B056-A72B-6CF2C9C93931}&path=past. Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. Partners are sought for conceptual planning efforts focused on demonstrating thefeasibility of developing instruments using lidar for CO2 flux measurements at theair-sea interface.In particular NASA LaRC is seeking potential partners having demonstrated experience withspaceborne cloud and aerosol lidars as well as expertise in fabrication, assembly, andtesting of those instruments. This integrated team will focus on developing a proposalfor the EV-I AO solicitation that includes a spaceborne lidar for measurements of oceansurface roughness, ocean subsurface extinction and backscatter, and aerosol/cloudextinction and backscatter.  The ocean surface roughness measurements will lead toimproved estimates of CO2 exchange between the ocean and atmosphere and the oceansubsurface measurements will contribute to those estimates as well as augment otherocean-color science applications.  The aerosol/cloud extinction and backscattermeasurements will be used to reduce uncertainties in aerosol affects on climate and thehydrological cycle and improve air quality forecasts.	The planned proposal work willleverage the success of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)backscatter lidar on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder SatelliteObservation (CALIPSO) satellite and some of the measurements recently demonstrated withCALIOP.   CALIPSO is a LaRC-led mission and more information can be found athttp://science.larc.nasa.gov/hsrl/index.html ). If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) will workwith NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If the proposalis selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selectedpartner(s) for performance of the proposed tasks.This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) technical requirements, conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input,project schedules, and cost estimates for space-based instrument concepts.  It isexpected that the selected partner(s) will work with NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC)scientists and engineers as a team to jointly develop the technical requirements for theproposed lidar; an instrument concept with sufficient detail to enable accurate mass,volume, power, telemetry requirements, cost, and schedule estimates for development,integration, and test of the proposed lidar; an assessment of areas of technical, cost,schedule risk and approaches for addressing those risks; and the technical and costvolumes of the proposal to the EV-I solicitation.  If the proposal is selected, it isanticipated that the partner(s) will work with LaRC on design, development, integration,and testing of the instrument; development of ground support equipment (GSE); developmentof software for the instrument and GSE; and other potential mission specific elements. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the followingorder of importance:(1)	Relevant Experience, past performance.	This criterion evaluates the proposersrelevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities.Substantive evidence of successful participation in similar developments should beincluded.(2)	Technical Capability and key personnel. This criterion evaluates technicalcapability to perform the development and key personnel available to support thedevelopment. Evidence of staffing estimates with available key personnel shall beincluded. Past successful programs and technical contributions shall be included.(3)	Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development,testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task.Instrument facilities for testing of space hardware and prototype hardware are consideredimportant to this opportunity. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access,and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.(4)	Cost and Schedule control.    The proposer shall provide evidence of pastperformance of controls of cost and schedule on similar development and provide examplesof management processes utilized to effect and track cost and schedule.NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in responseto this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparationcosts incurred by the team members.RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 10 pagesin not less than 12-point font.  Responses must address the aforementioned evaluationcriteria.  All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via email by 5:00pmEST on February 1, 2011 to Chris Hostetler (Chris.A.Hostetler@nasa.gov) and Teresa Hass(Teresa.M.Hass@nasa.gov).

All MRI systems must be capable of collection state-of-the-art images of the human heart and peripheral vasculature. 

All must feature a wide bore (70cm) for improved patient comfort and at least 48 receive channels (as described below).  Additionally, all system must have an option for multiple radiofrequency transmission channels (as indicated below) either at the time of installation or as an upgrade option in the future. 

The software platform for all systems should be open such that pulse sequences and image reconstruction software can be modified by the on-site investigators. 

For the two interventional systems (NIH INTERVENTIONAL, NIH CNMC) it must be possible to transfer patients from an adjacent bi-plane X-ray fluoroscopy to the MRI systems and back (see below).

4. Magnet and Field Strength
Magnets must have a minimum 70 cm bore diameter for both 1.5 and 3T. A zero helium boil-off magnet is preferred.  

5. Gradients
The systems must be able to provide a gradient strength of minimum 45 mT/m along each gradient axis independently. A minimum slew rate of 200 T/m/s along each gradient axis (independently) is required. 

6. Radiofrequency Receiver System & Coils
All systems must feature at least 48 receiver channels with potential for upgrade to more channels.  The system must feature surface coil arrays suitable for parallel imaging in cardiac and abdominal imaging applications.  

7. Radiofrequency Transmit System

8. Gating and physiological monitoring
The Offerer shall provide a capability for physiological gating and monitoring including vector ECG, respiratory, and pulse-oximetry. Physiological monitoring shall use wireless technology. Additionally, the system shall be capable of gating using an external triggering signal.


9. Image Reconstruction Systems
The image reconstruction system must be capable of reconstructing images in real-time when acquiring parallel imaging data. Specifically, the system must be able to perform reconstruction of 2D parallel imaging data (matrix size 256, acceleration factor 2-4) acquired with 32 receive coils at a frame rate of at least 15 frames per second.  The reconstruction hardware must feature a minimum of 32 GB RAM and a 64 bit multiprocessor system (8 cores minimum). The reconstruction system must be programmable by the on-site investigators.  

10. Software
Software packages shall be state-of-the-art sequence and reconstruction packages to enable cardiovascular and interventional imaging.  The systems must be fully programmable such the end users and investigators can modify sequences and reconstruction software.  

11. Analysis workstations
Image analysis is currently performed using software tools provided on the Siemens LEONARDO workstations. NHLBI currently has a total of 12 workstations in various locations on the NIH and SUBURBAN campuses.  Compatibility of the new systems must be ensured with the current analysis workstations, or propose an alternative solution which could be in form of a centralized server. 

12.  External network interfaces
The MRI systems must be able to connect to modern PACS systems for image transfer. Systems with HL7 interfacing capabilities will be preferred. It must be possible to connect to the systems with a remote desktop type client and remote control the systems. This is especially important for remote support of the systems installed off the NIH campus (NIH SUBURBAN, NIH CNMC).

13.  Special Requirements for interventional systems
Special requirements for the interventional systems (NIH INTERVENTIONAL, NIH CNMC) are as follows:
Installation will be linked to an adjacent bi-plane X-ray system, constituting a combined X-ray/MRI (XMR) suite.  A system for transferring patients from the X-ray system to the MRI scanner and back, in a seamless and expeditious manner will be required. Components of the patient transfer that will be subject to x-ray must be radiolucent and must not interfere with MRI. The MRI systems will be separated from the X-ray system with a set of RF shielded sliding doors.  The interventional systems shall have a moving table MRI capability to allow scanning as the table is moved.  The MRI hemodynamic system should interface with a commercial X-ray hemodynamic recording system.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans to renew the Cardiovascular Health Study  Core Support contract to maintain the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) organization and resources for ongoing and future epidemiologic research in cardiovascular disease and other relevant topics in older adults.  The CHS is a multi-center longitudinal study of risk factors for development and progression of cardiovascular disease and stroke in men and women ages 65 and older (see www.chs-nhlbi.org).  Previous NHLBI contracts supported collection of data, blood and urine samples, and DNA from 5,888 CHS participants at four field centers during 10 annual examinations during the period 1989-1999 and semi-annual phone calls through May 2005.  

A transition phase contract awarded in 2005 and renewed in 2008 has provided support for core study functions, while investigator-initiated grants and other sources that fund CHS research projects provide the balance of support.   Of CHS more than 175 total such ancillary studies, led by a broad range of investigators and institutions, approximately 35 are currently active.  These research projects expand the CHS enterprise by submitting periodic updates of cohort members vital status, validated clinical events of interest, and other newly collected data for incorporation into the main CHS data set maintained by the core support contract.  Results from these ancillary studies are disseminated in accordance with CHS policies via presentations at scientific conferences and publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  To date, more than 700 CHS papers have been published.   

A small business sources sought announcement was previously issued for this requirement to assess the capability of small businesses to meet the project requirements for this acquisition.  If the findings from that announcement indicate that two or more small businesses are found capable of performing this requirement, it will be set-aside for small business.

Purpose and Objectives

The goal of the proposed project is to maximize scientific yield from NHLBIs past investment in this highly productive study.  The specific objectives are to facilitate continued access to study resources and expertise by investigators new to CHS; promote ongoing and future scientific productivity, collaboration, and mentorship of junior investigators; provide direction and analytic support to existing CHS working groups; and facilitate establishment of a new health services research working group.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR COMMENTS AND SOURCES SOUGHT<br />PRINT-ON-DEMAND U.S. COAST PILOT
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of Coast Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) makes the official United States Coast Pilot&reg;.  The Coast Pilot is a 9-volume text supplement to the official nautical charts.  It is used aboard all commercial vessels, federal vessels, and on many recreational boats to enhance the safety and efficiency of navigation, and for other purposes.</p>
<p>The traditional version of the Coast Pilot is printed in quantity annually using lithographic technology then stored and sold at wholesale to retail sales agents. This method results in the sale of a gradually obsolescing product with some mariners purchasing a new volume that may require a year's worth of weekly corrections in order to comply with federal chart and publication carriage regulations.</p>
<p>NOAA intends to improve its Coast Pilot updating and publishing practice using Print on Demand technology.  With this  new approach , NOAA will update the Coast Pilots weekly and provide digital versions in .PDF format to official "Publishing Agents" who will then print from the up-to-date files when copies are ordered.  A Publishing Agent will sell Coast Pilots through its own network of retailers and distributors and be compensated by its sales.  No funds will be provided by the government.</p>
<p>NOAA intends to accept a limited number of Coast Pilot Publishing Agents.  These agents would, of necessity, have to be sufficiently competent technically to manage, assemble, and print the NOAA digital files.  These partners would also have to establish a successful sales effort in order to be compensated.</p>
<p>While the weekly updating process is not yet operational, NOAA is establishing the Publishing Agent network as qualified applicants come forward.&nbsp; Agents will be provided with digital files of the annually-printed Coast Pilot as they are released to use in establishing the Agents' printing, selling, and distribution capability.</p>
<p>NOAA is soliciting questions and comments on its intention, on the Agent Agreement, and is also soliciting non-binding statements of interest from potential Publishing Agents.  Respond by e-mail to Thomas.Loeper@NOAA.gov; by fax to 301-713-9312; by letter to Thomas Loeper, Chief, Coast Pilot Branch, Office of Coast Survey, NOAA, (Mail Stop: NOS/OCS/NSD/CPB); 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD, 20910; or by phone to Thomas Loeper, 301-713-2750 x 165.</p>

<p>The scope of SCES is limited to security cooperation business processes specific to case execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For requirements development, the SCES team, which includes DSCA, MILDEP, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) and BTA representatives, identified four high-level end-to-end business processes applicable to case execution (Prospect to Order, Order to Cash, Budget to Report, and Procure to Pay) that were aligned with the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The team then identified business process design opportunities and developed functional and data requirements for each end-to-end business process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 18, 2010, after completion of an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the Director of DSCA, who also presides as the SCES Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), issued a memorandum approving the recommendation of the AoA to proceed with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ERP solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As directed by the MDA, the SCES Program Management Office (PMO) developed a Business Case, Program Charter, Acquisition Program Baseline and other supporting documents which were presented to the Combined Investment Review Board (IRB) on July 13, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="COLOR: black">On July 23, 2010, the MDA approved SCES for a Milestone A/B decision and established SCES as an ACAT III Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Marine Corps System Command (MCSC)  is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.

4.0 Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) 
5.0 Response Format to RFI 

1.0	Emergency Management Command and Coordination (EMC2)

Installations throughout the United States Marine Corps (USMC), within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside CONUS (OCONUS), have a variety of Emergency Management Command and Coordination (EMC2) assets at different stages of capabilities.
  Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) DM 20-2010 validated the need for EMC2 acquisition efforts in the form of Consolidated Emergency Response System (CERS) and a portion (the slice) of the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) that supports first responders within populated areas of the Base, Post, Station (B/P/S).  A first responder is defined as fire department, emergency medical service (EMS), and law enforcement IAW EMC2 oversight council direction.

2.0	Consolidated Emergency Response Systems (CERS)
The purpose of CERS is to perform the same rapid emergency response services as the civilian (i.e. city, county, etc.) Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  CERS is a secure (sensitive but unclassified) system composed of hardware and software components that facilitate expedient emergency response.
 As an integrated system, CERS will be used to support command and coordination (C2) functions that dispatch First Responders to support an incident or crisis. CERS main objective is to provide notification functions, resource management and situational awareness (SA) to support efficient First Responder dispatching. The goal is to shift from independent reaction to early preventive coordinated measures that increase the speed of action to prevent or mitigate incidents from escalating into a crisis situation.
CERS role will vary and expand to accommodate Homeland Defense initiatives, Marine Corps Mission Assurance, and other emergency First Responder efforts. Through Mission Assurance and Availability (MAA), CERS may serve as a primary or secondary PSAP, as well as a backup Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) site for the civilian (i.e.
 county, city, etc.) PSAP(s). 
CERS is the Marine Corps' installation C2 solution that will comply with the National Response Framework (NRF), National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD).

CERS Considerations
E911 Call Taking System
CAD system including mapping using ESRI source data
Training systems for equipment and scenarios
Wireless Phase II 
VOIP 
Compliance with NIMS, NFPA, ADA and NENA standards referred in CERS SON. 
COTS solution

Interfaces 
Mass Notification  Giant Voice, Little Voice, R911, text etc
Electronic Security Systems  CCTV, IDS, etc
Fire Station and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) alerting  visual, audible and heart-ramped tones, etc
Common Operating Picture  WebEOC, Navy COP
Patient Tracking Systems

3.0 Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (ELMR) Slice 

The purpose of Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) Slice is to provide radio network for first responders; fire department, law enforcement, and emergency medical services (EMS) to communicate and transmission pathway for CERS dispatch functions.
 The Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) Slice system includes Radio Frequency (RF) and data network infrastructure.  This includes the Radio Frequency Sub-System (RFSS), RF repeater sites (towers, shelters, power and grounding, and environmental control), transmission lines, transmission systems, encryption key management systems, information/network management systems, physical security, information security (hardware and software), radio-telephone interconnect capability, and log recording equipment.  It is envisioned to be a commercial offthe-shelf (COTS) equipment integration without a hardware or software developmental stage.

E-LMR Slice is that portion of the E-LMR system that will support B/P/S First Responders daily, emergency, and All-Hazards operations.
 B/P/S fire and rescue area of responsibility includes public, private venture (PPV) housing areas and main population areas as well as the access to these areas. Continuity of Operations (COOP) planning and Information Assurance (IA) compliance (e.g. DIACAP and encryption) are required.  

4.0	Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR)

The E-LMR Command and Control network services will be a tiered system consisting of Base, Regional and Enterprise level operations. At the base level, radio dispatch and subscriber calls, audio recording and repeater/site management/monitor and control activities will be conducted. The regional level will provide cryptographic key management, system level management, and infrastructure restoration services.
 The enterprise level will control the USMC Global Enterprise Fleetmap (UGEF), coordinate and engineer RF control-channel plans, provide enterprise key generation and distribution to Marine Corps Installations (MCI) regions, manage enterprise databases, manage network configuration and topology, provide enterprise-wide Continuity of Operations (COOP) planning and ensure Information Assurance (IA) compliance (e.g. DIACAP and encryption).  

The system used to satisfy this enterprise requirement must provide coverage both on and off each BPS, range, or USMC related service area and must support narrowband trunked and conventional LMR operations for both clear and encrypted voice as well as mobile data services.
 The system will be compliant with the Association of Public-safety Communications Officials International (APCO) P25 suite of standards and all applicable Department of Defense (DoD) information assurance, interoperability, and spectrum utilization requirements. 

There are five regions, 20 identified USMC B/P/S, 106 identified potential repeater sites on USMC or other federal property, and one enterprise node with a COOP requirement.  Site surveys are being conducted by the Marine Corps for potential repeater sites and detailed engineering documents will be provided for those sites.  These site surveys are considered Government Furnished Information but the government does not assert that these are the only sites available to an interested party.

<DESC>The 55th Contracting Squadron, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) Flight at Offutt AFB, NE intends to enter into a sole source award with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), 1800 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20006 under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 to conduct an efficiency initiatives study of the Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) Information Analysis Centers (IACs) to identify steps the IACs, and potentially, DTIC as a whole, should take to support DoD efficiency initiatives. CSIS is a large, nonprofit organization. The study will conduct research by obtaining inputs from DTIC, DoD leadership, and customers in order to make recommendations to DTIC on optimal, cost effective and feasible approaches for implementing guidance issued by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD AT&amp;L) on 14 September 2010, which set forth 23 initiatives for increasing efficiency in DoD acquisitions. <br /><br />DTIC serves the DoD community as the largest central resource for DoD and government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business related information available today. IACs (http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/iac/) are research and analysis organizations established by the DoD and operated by DTIC, to help researchers, engineers, scientists and program managers utilize existing Scientific and Technical Information (STI) to solve their most difficult challenges. Specifically, IACs improve productivity of researchers, engineers, and program managers in the defense research, development, and acquisition communities by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating worldwide STI in clearly defined, specialized fields or subject areas. IACs were established and are guided by DoD Directive 3200.12 and DODINST 3200.14. DTIC operates under the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) which sets policy for the IACs. <br /><br />To accomplish the objectives above, IACs establish and maintain comprehensive knowledge bases that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. IACs also work directly with customers on Technical Area Tasks (TATs), which yield new STI; this is added to one or more of the ten IACs, based on its technical focus. Customers who use the IAC program are able to save federal dollars by not duplicating work that's already been performed across a broad spectrum of products and services. Services currently offered by the IACs range from basic Q&amp;A to in-depth technical activities known as TATs. There are currently ten IACs managed by DTIC; all are operated and hosted under separate contracts by industry or academic institutions. <br /><br />Over the past several years, the IAC customer base has expanded exponentially, as the IACs have leveraged collective knowledge and skills to support their customers' growing needs. In addition to DoD, IAC customers include other federal agencies with an interest in national security issues, such as the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services and agencies throughout the intelligence community. <br /><br />In May, 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates expressed a goal of achieving DoD-wide savings through efficiency initiatives. He expressed his intent to provide the equivalent of 2-3% real growth through these cost savings and outlined eight initiatives for immediate action. In September 2010, Dr. Ashton Carter, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L)), issued a memo to defense acquisition professionals providing detailed guidance for 23 principal actions to implement these DoD Efficiency Initiatives. Each DoD component must develop a plan to incorporate and implement these goals and steps. DoD leadership expects organizations to conduct careful oversight, make necessary adjustments and highlight issues or concerns.<br /><br />DTIC and the IACs have echoed these goals in the DTIC Strategic Plan. The IAC Program Office has identified a need to support these initiatives by taking steps to re-evaluate and streamline the IACs' missions, functions, resource pool and customer base. The DTIC IACs' mission is to improve the productivity of DoD researchers, engineers and program managers by collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and disseminating worldwide scientific and technical information in clearly defined, specialized fields or subject areas. Because DTIC's mission has broad-ranging strategic and tactical impacts across DoD, and because the agency has such a large customer base, the challenge to implement efficiencies without adversely impacting DoD's mission is especially complex. <br /><br />The aforementioned sole source award to CSIS is intended to help the IAC Program Management Office (PMO) contribute to these goals. Specifically, this requirement is for services to conduct a study to identify steps the IACs, and potentially, DTIC as a whole, should take to support DoD efficiency initiatives. The study will investigate approaches to streamlining the IACs' missions, functions, resource pool and customer base. <br /><br />Because of the complexities of this requirement, the Government believes that only a contractor with a nationally regarded subject matter expertise who possess decades of high-level, first-hand experience in DoD strategic planning and efficiency/cost reform efforts is qualified to conduct this analysis. The contractor must be able to develop meaningful, well-informed and relevant recommendations that will carry credibility with DTIC and the Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) - DTIC's parent agency and an expert who is already well-versed in DTIC and the IACs' missions, with an in-depth understanding of current and past military programs, policies, initiatives and interrelationships from the perspective of having served successfully in the highest level senior DoD leadership positions. More specifically, CSIS employs a subject matter expert (SME) uniquely qualified in analyzing and implementing past DoD initiatives to increase efficiency, improve management, and reduce costs and the Government believes that expertise will substantially benefit this effort. The SME's direct and relevant experience includes:
<p>&bull; An assessment in 1981 for the Deputy Secretary of Defense of the impact of and lessons learned from the McNamara Cost Reduction Program, the Laird Management-by-Objectives Program, and the Brown Zero-Based Budget Program. The results of the SME's study formed the basis of the Weinberger Economies and Efficiencies Program from 1981-1984.<br />&bull; In 1983-1984, the SME was Special Assistant to the DoD Comptroller, overseeing the implementation of the Weinberger Economies and Efficiencies Program and its incorporation into the DoD budget.<br />&bull; In 1989, the SME was a principal author of the Cheney Defense Management Report (DMR). From 1989-1992, the SM was responsible for implementing 70% of the savings derived from Defense Management Report Decisions (DMRDs). Those savings were later validated by the Odeen panel under Secretary of Defense Aspin. Among those actions were the creation of the Defense Contract Management Command (now Agency) and the Defense Commissary Agency.<br />&bull; In 1995-96, the SME was part of the 4-person team that conducted the OSD Management Review for the Deputy Secretary of Defense. This review formed the basis of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) and the related Defense Reform Initiative Decisions (DRIDs).<br />&bull; The SME was Executive Secretary of the Defense Council on Integrity and Management Improvement, Executive Secretary of the Packard Commission, and a DoD consultant on both the 1997 and 2005 QDR and on implementation of the 2005 QDR.<br />&bull; In 2007-2008, the SME was Principal Investigator on Defense Acquisition and Defense Business Transformation for the CSIS study for DoD on "Transitioning Defense Organizational Initiatives".<br /><br />This notice of intent, required by FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this procurement. Any firm that believes it is equally or otherwise uniquely capable of meeting the requirements described herein may submit a capabilities statement (to include contact information, size status under NAICS 541611, DUNS Number, and CAGE Code) which, if received no later than 4:00 PM Central Time on 18 Jan 2011, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only to Jerry Martin, 55th CONS DTIC Flight at jerry.martin@offutt.af.mil. A determination not to compete the described contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government. <br /><br />To mitigate the potential for an organizational conflict of interest, CSIS shall be restricted from being a prime or a subcontractor on any of the DTIC IAC contracts. Similarly, DTIC IAC contractors and subcontractors shall be restricted from participating as a prime or subcontractor on this efficiencies study.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  WARSTAR directorate, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Sensomotoric Instruments Inc. 75 Arlington St Ste 5000, Boston, MA 02116.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR><BR>RESPONSES WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ONLY.<BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>NSRDEC requires the purchase of two specialized data collection devices to support ongoing internal research on the perceptual bases of gathering information from spatial and non-spatial visualization technologies. Specifically, WARSTAR needs to purchase reliable, validated, and time-proven eye movement monitoring technologies that offer characteristics necessary to perform experimental research on how the organization and content of visualizations affect Soldier information gathering and memory.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>The Cognitive Performance laboratory has existing experience using SensoMotoric Instruments' (SMI) technologies and software, and is aware of the unique advantages of their products. SMI eye tracking technologies provide the sampling rates (50Hz and 500Hz), resolution (0.5  visual angle), portability, reliability, and sensitivity that are required for the research being performed at NSRDEC. The company is internationally-renowned for developing precise and reliable technologies for behavioral and cognitive science applications, and they are uniquely suited to provide the products requested herein.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>In preparation for this request WARSTAR sought to identify technologies from several manufacturers that fulfilled our multiple criteria: resolution, sensitivity, validation, speed, ease of use, and reliability. Though several eye tracking companies and products were found during our market research, none other than SMI fulfilled all of their criteria while maintaining competitive pricing. Given the directorates specific focus on research involving visualization technologies and cognitive performance, and the importance of each of our criteria, the results of our market research indicate that SMI is the only company uniquely capable of providing the necessary eye tracking technologies to perform the research.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR>None<BR><BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>None<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: jeff.bernard@us.army.mil no later than 12:00 Noon (EST) on January 16, 2011.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SY, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Jeffrey Bernard, Contract Specialist (508)-233-6105<BR>Jeff.bernard@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)1. Per FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Per FAR 6.302-1(ii)(A) Coastal Resources Associates, Inc is the only responsible vendor able to carry out these services due to the substantial duplications of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.The mission of this contract is to have the contractor assist in the refinement of current protocols and SOPs based on the results of a 5 year analysis (to be started in 2011) of existing data. Available data will be used in simulations, in a Bayesian framework, to estimate number of samples and sample frequency required to detect a specified trend or change with some level of confidence for selected metrics. This long-term monitoring program is needed to support understanding and protecting the biophysical coastal resources of these park units as directed by enabling legislation, the NPS-Natural Resources Challenge, and the NPS-Ocean Park Strategy. 
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).CRA utilizes a unique and innovative concept, and has demonstrated a unique capability to provide the particular research services required. CRA has been involved with designing monitoring for the SWAN since 2004. It is crucial to continue implementation, analysis and interpretation using the same scientists to avoid the bias inherent in having different contractors using different field personnel and applying different approaches to conduct monitoring.  Continuity is the foundation of long-term ecological monitoring because of the need to collect standardized measurements and produce continuous data bases. Any program of long-term research and monitoring, therefore, must involve both individual and institutional participation in some collaborative manner.4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Few nearshore marine ecologists have designed and implemented nearshore monitoring along the northern Gulf of Alaska including National Park coastlines and are qualified to meet the requirements of this contract. Annually, at the Marine Science Symposium (the primary meeting of marine coastal scientists for the north pacific) in Anchorage, the NPS solicited marine scientists that were interested and qualified to work with SWAN. Since 2002, this effort has resulted in contracts with several private and non-profit businesses and organizations that have also had a long association with the EVOS-Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring program. The only firm uniquely qualified to do the intertidal monitoring development in conjunction with the development of the overall nearshore monitoring protocol has been CRA.  5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  N/A6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<DESC>Procurement Office:  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Procurement Operations Division, (3803R)
Response Date:  January 25, 2011
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation?s Office of Radiation and Indoor Air  intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to F&J Specialty Products of Ocala, FL for Diffusion Barrier Charcoal Canisters.
The canisters must be purchased from F&J Specialty Products to retain continuity in ongoing radon measurement analysis projects.   The Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (R&IE), Center for Indoor Environments, is the EPA?s primary laboratory for radon measurements and analysis. The laboratory has been carrying out this mission for well over a decade. Nearly all of the radon measurement analysis projects being conducted by the laboratory are long-term spanning over many years and are linked to years of quality assurance data generated by the EPA Laboratory.  All of the EPA R&IE quality assurance data, including calibration curves, are based on the unique configuration of the Calgon and comparable 1193 carbon diffusion barrier canisters manufactured by F&J Specialty, Inc. Any deviation, however slight from the F&J canister configuration process would invalidate the continuity of quality assurance and calibration data. Furthermore, the EPA Laboratory would be  required to spend substantial time and resources generating new calibration curves, validating performance and generating new quality assurance databases for any change in canister configuration and performance due to a change of manufacturers of other unknown products.  The R&IE Radon Laboratory has researched these issues thoroughly in their efforts to find a qualified vendor. Because of the critical nature of this Radon Program, its continued smooth operation, and the requirements to maintain R&IE Laboratory quality assurance standards, F&J Specialty, Inc. is the only qualified vendor.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing via e-mail to Schwartz.rachel@epa.gov by January 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM EST.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.
The point of contact for this procurement is Rachel Schwartz, Contract Specialist, at Schwartz.rachel@epa.gov.

<p>The purpose of this Modification 49 is to obligate $50,000 in new funding for Option Period 3 in support of Work Assignment 3-105. The period of performance for the new Work Assignment 3-105 is anticipated to be from April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-105, the contractor will provide needed technical and engineering support to EPA Region III in its oversight of DC in order to ensure successful implementation of the ARRA requirements for ARRA-funded DDOE CW projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability <br /><br />1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

<p>JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />Background:<br />Peru is the second largest cocaine producing country in the world. A major exporter of cocaine and cocaine base to markets in South American, M&eacute;xico, United States, and Europe. The U.S. Crime and Narcotics Center estimated in 2008, 41,000 hectares of coca were under cultivation in Peru. In 2009, the government of Peru manually eradicated 10,025 hectares of illicit coca.</p>
<p>Eradication linked closely to alternative development programs, has led to dramatic reductions of coca cultivation in the Upper Huallaga Valley where eradication efforts are focused, this is particularly evident in San Martin department. However, challenges remain in other parts of the country where State presence is limited, and where increased coca cultivation and trafficking have been reported, such as in the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE).

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT SHALL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-48.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325998 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. <br />In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a block of pure bismuth to be used as filter material.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering. This project provides for over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research. In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>To remain at the forefront of science, the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is continuously developing new and improved instruments for neutron scattering. NIST requires an accurately dimensioned rectangular block made from pure, single-crystal bismuth. This bismuth block shall be cryogenically cooled and shall be located upstream of a new instrument named the Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR) and shall be used as a gamma ray filter for CANDOR.</p>
<p>This block of pure bismuth shall be made up of several large crystals and shall be used to filter out unwanted gamma rays from the neutron beam. Single-crystal bismuth is known to be affective in attenuating gamma rays whose high energy can distort the purity of the thermal neutrons. Single crystal and large crystal bismuth has much higher transmission of neutrons between .4nm and .8nm than small crystal (fine grained) polycrystalline due to the minimization of Bragg scattering by reducing the number of individual crystals. Cooling the bismuth has the effect of making the crystals become nearly transparent to thermal neutrons and remain nearly opaque to high energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, bismuth block (that shall be made up of several large single crystals), which satisfies the material and end product specifications defined herein to achieve the desired performance as a gamma ray filter.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Space Commercialization (OSC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, is responsible for implementing space-related policies and promotion of capabilities of the U.S. commercial space industry. The Office assists U.S. commercial providers in their efforts to expand their business with the U.S. Government and promotes commercial provider investment by performing economic analysis on space markets. OSC acts as an industry advocate within the executive branch of the Federal Government to maximize the use of commercially available space goods and services, reduce legal and regulatory impediments, and ensure the government does not compete with the U.S. commercial space industry.
<p>The December 8, 2004 U.S. Space-Based Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Policy authorized a new comprehensive national policy that established guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation and timing programs, augmentations and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil, scientific and commercial purposes. This policy established the National Spaced-Based PNT Executive Committee, co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation, to manage the dual use (civil/military) GPS and established the National Space- Based PNT Coordination Office. The new policy directs the Coordination Office to:</p>
<p>1.1.1. Develop and implement processes and relationships with Executive Committee members to facilitate information sharing, coordination, and issue resolution regarding Department and Agency program plans, requirements, budgets, and policies for operation of U.S. space-based PNT systems and services. <br />1.1.2. Coordinate Department and Agency PNT program plans, requirements, budgets, and policies, and assess the adequacy of funding and schedules to facilitate the timely integration and deconfliction of requirements for space-based PNT capabilities. <br />1.1.3. Evaluate plans to modernize the U.S. space-based PNT infrastructure, including development, deployment, and operation of new and/or improved national security and civil services that exceed, or are at least equivalent to, foreign space-based PNT services. <br />1.1.4. Review Department and Agency proposals on international cooperation that require interagency coordination, such as spectrum management and protection issues, and provide recommendations to the Executive Committee. <br />1.1.5. Conduct or oversee space-based PNT studies, analyses, and projects with a National benefit beyond the scope of a single Department or Agency, to include an assessment of ongoing Department and Agency efforts that may benefit from broader U.S. Government participation. <br />1.1.6. Represent the Executive Committee on space-based PNT matters within the Government, the public sector, and with representatives of foreign governments and international organizations, as appropriate, in carrying out assigned responsibilities and functions. <br />1.1.7. Assess the functions established under the former Interagency Global Positioning System Executive Board structure, and make appropriate recommendations to the Executive Committee regarding final disposition. <br />1.1.8. Assess additional interagency PNT functions and responsibilities against those assigned to the Executive Committee in accordance with the U.S. Space-Based PNT Policy and make recommendations as appropriate. <br />1.1.9. Administer the National Space-Based PNT Advisory Board, a Federal Advisory Committee, in coordination with the host Department. Have responsibility for the development of requirements for civil applications from all U.S. Government civil Departments and Agencies.</p>
<p>In 1958, shortly after the launching of the first artificial satellite, the General Assembly decided to establish an adhoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (resolution 1348 (XIII)), with 18 members, in order to consider the activities and resources of the United Nations, the specialized agencies and other international bodies relating to the peaceful uses of outer space; international cooperation and programmes in the field that could appropriately be undertaken under United Nations auspices; organizational arrangements to facilitate international cooperation in the field within the framework of the United Nations; and legal problems which might arise in programmes to explore outer space. In 1959, the General Assembly established the Committee as a permanent body and reaffirmed its mandate in resolution 1472 (XIV). The United States of America was one of the 18 original members and remains a current member.<br />The United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs is the secretariat for the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.</p>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>The services required by OSC are available from only one responsible source, United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, with whom the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Space Commercialization is party to.</p>
<p>OSC shall be the principal unit for space commerce policy activities within NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce, with responsibilities to include:</p>
<p>1. Coordinate space commerce policy issues and actions within NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce.<br />2. Represent the Department in the development of U.S. policies and in negotiations with foreign countries to promote U.S. space commerce.<br />3. Assist commercial space companies in their efforts to do business with the U.S. Government, and act as industry's advocate within the Executive Branch to ensure the Government meets its space-related requirements, to the maximum practical extent, with commercially available space goods and services, consistent with national security.<br />4. Work to ensure the U.S. Government does not engage in space-related activities that preclude, deter, or compete with U.S. commercial space activities unless required by national security or public safety.<br />5. Seek the removal of legal, policy, and institutional impediments to space commerce.</p>
<p>1.0 Scope</p>
<p>OSC shall provide one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs in exchange for their services identified below.</p>
<p>The United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, with whom the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Space Commercialization is party to, shall provide secretariat services for the Director of the National Space-Based PNT Coordination Office. The agreement establishes secretariat services for the following five United Nations Programme on Space Applications activities:</p>
<p>The five activities that are the subject of this agreement include:</p>
<p>1. United Nations/European Space Agency Basic Science Workshops</p>
<p>United Nations/European Space Agency Basic Science Workshops are held in an effort in furthering knowledge and experience of space applications around the world. Provision of in-country capacity-building, education, research and development support and technical advisory services by the Programme help create conditions under which the developing countries benefit. To assure the United Nations/European Space Agency workshops do not create a duplication of efforts with other activities in the United Nation framework, the workshops context are clearly defined to cover: fundamental physics; astronomy and astrophysics; solar-terrestrial interaction and its influence on terrestrial climate; planetary and atmospheric studies; and origin of life and exo-bilogy. The applicable techniques used as tools for the pursuance of basic space science research are: ground-based optical, and radio observations; radio and optical telescopes with associated equipment; remote sensing, both from the ground and from space; all measurements from ground-inaccessible windows which can only be made through the use of instruments and telescopes in Earth orbit; and in-situ measurements from rocket, balloon and satellite platforms.</p>
<p><br />2. United Nations Platform for Space-Based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER)</p>
<p>The mission for the UN-SPIDER United Nations Programme is to ensure that all countries and international and regional organizations have access to and develop the capacity to use all types of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle. UN-SPIDER programme focuses on ensuring access to and use of making space technologies available for humanitarian and emergency response and all phases of the disaster management cycle, including the risk reduction phase, to reduce the loss of lives and property. UN-SPIDER programme serves as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities and as facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening, in particular for developing countries.</p>
<p>3. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space <br />This committee is to provide a focal point international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, to maintain close contact with governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with outer space matters; to provide for the exchange of such information relating to outer space activities as Governments may supply on a voluntary basis, supplementing, but not duplicating, existing technical and scientific exchanges; and to assist in the study of measures for the promotion of international cooperation in outer space activities.</p>
<p>4. Legal Subcommittee <br /><br />The Legal Subcommittee is responsible to craft legal engines for the growth of space; to implement the Outer Space treaty in national law in light of current and foreseeable space activities; create space legislation as enhancer of space activities and policies; consider economic impacts of national space legislation and the establishment of fair conditions for commercial activities; and ensure accompanying space regulations are safe in-orbit operation and interoperability.</p>
<p>5. Regional Centres for Space Science and Technology Education<br />The United Nations inititiated a project aimed at the establishment of regional centres for space science and technology education at existing research and higher education institutions. Each centre is conceived as an institution. The principal goal of each centre is the development of the skills and knowledge of university educators and research and applications scientists, through theory, research, applications, field exercises, and pilot projects in those aspects of space science and technology. The programmes of each centre focuses on: remote sensing and geographic information systems; meteorological satellite applications; satellite communications and geopositioning systems; and space and atmospheric sciences.</p>
<p><br />In addition, the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs shall continue to provide secretariat support for the activities of the International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems in promoting the use of GNSS technologies. ICG reaches out to developing countries to promote the use of space-based positioning, navigation and timing applications and address technical issues. Such outreach broadens the eventual reach of the market place for space-based PNT products and services. ICG activities include: supporting the establishment of practical reference frames and GNSS performance monitoring; increasing awareness of protecting the GNSS spectrum from interference and providing assistance to developing countries in identifying and eliminating sources of electromagnetic interference; and increasing educational opportunities related to GNSS application and use.</p>
<p>At ICG-1, the Terms of Reference were adopted, maintaining the non-binding, informal nature of the ICG. The U.S. sees an ongoing and future role of the ICG to:</p>
<p>&bull; Promote communication and cooperation between operators and users of GNSS and their augmentations;</p>
<p>&bull; Encourage the international growth and potential benefits of GNSS applications;</p>
<p>&bull; Promote the introduction and utilization of satellite positioning, navigation and timing services particularly in developing countries, through assistance with the integration of GNSS services in their infrastructures;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist both the members of the Committee and the international user community by serving as the focal point for international information exchange related to GNSS activities; and</p>
<p>&bull; Inform ICG members of efforts to pursue greater compatibility and interoperability among all current and future systems in terms of spectrum, signal structures, time standards, and geodetic reference frames to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p>The ICG represents an unparalleled opportunity for the U.S. to promote the application and use of GPS as the core of an international system of GNSS that are compatible and interoperable with GPS.</p>
<p>The support for the workshops and committees provided by the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs is consistent with U.S. space-based PNT policy and in order to enable focused discussions on compatibility and interoperability among current and future global and regional space-based systems, and promotion of systems based on GPS, the U.S. encouraged the support.</p>
<p>2.0 Special Requirements<br />OSC, in coordination with the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs, will determine the need and/or priority of the specific tasks and appropriate level of resource utilization.<br />Personnel shall be screened in accordance with the requirements for Low Risk contracts as specified by CAM 1337.70 section 2.2; specifically, in accordance with CAR 1352.237-71, Security Processing Requirements-Low Risk Contracts (April 2010).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-11-Q-0020) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611.

CLIN 0004- Refurbish one (1) 24 MONARK BOAT (BM-1); 

Period of performance: 02/21/2011 through 07/29/2011.
  Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire Statement of Work (SOW).  

PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage.  

DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.  

52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(i)	Past Performance
(ii)	Price

Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a quoter has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Quoters past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 
1. Technical (Quality of Product)  the expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an quoters past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions.
 
2. Schedule  the expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a quoters past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 
3. Management  the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an quoters past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 

This includes an evaluation of the quoters past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Governments evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Governments local files to evaluate past performance.
 The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not consider the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation.
 

Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide information about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts.
 Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.
 
The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0004. The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4.
 The Government will also determine the realism of the proposed price.  A contract price is realistic if it is high enough to preclude the contractor from enduring a significant financial loss in performing the requirements of the contract.  Unrealistically low prices increase performance risk to the Government.  The risk to the Government is that the contractorto cut its lossesmight: cut corners on product quality; deliver late; default, forcing a time-consuming reprocurement; or refuse to deal with the Government in the future or be forced out of business entirely.  The Government will base its evaluation of price realism on a comparison of a quoters proposed price to other proposed prices received in response to this solicitation and the independent Government estimate.
  Prices will be rated either realistic or unrealistically low.

(b) Options (not applicable).
 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the quotes specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

(d) Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the item required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:
Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.
  Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make a quoter ineligible for award.  

The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3.  More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.  Quoters whove completed ORCA should notify the contract specialist before solicitations closing date and time so it can be downloaded by the procuring contracting office.

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance):</p>
<p>Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, lodging, and secured storage. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to comply with the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotations should reflect the quality of services provided and maintained. (b) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date. (c) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the following U.S. Postal Code areas (see attachment for a complete list of area zip codes),&nbsp;with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters. Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc). In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Certification, apply to this acquisition.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of provision)<BR><BR>Addendum to 52.212-2<BR><BR>The Government will evaluate each quote strictly in accordance with its contents.  A quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements.  Such quotes may be determined unacceptable.  Award will be made to the lowest-price, technically-acceptable offeror.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the quote that possesses all of the following characteristics:  <BR>(1) meets the acceptability standards,<BR>(2) conforms to the solicitation,<BR>(3) determined acceptable to the Government,<BR>(4) is from a responsible (as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9) offeror, and <BR>(5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.  <BR><BR>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. <BR><BR>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS:<BR><BR>(1) Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.  <BR><BR>(2)  Unacceptable - A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk  and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal. <BR><BR>(End of addendum to 52.212-2)<BR><BR>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alt I.  (Offerors must complete FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial items or do so on-line at http://orca.bpn.gov); 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification; 52.225-25 Prohibition on Engaging in Sanctioned Activities Relating to Iran-Certification; 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference; 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<BR><BR><BR><BR>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than 29 NOV 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Vladimir G. Ossochenko<br />Managing Director for National Power Grid Development<br />Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company<br />Joint Stock Company<br />37, Beibitshilik St., Saryarka District<br />Astana 01000, Republic Of Kazakhstan</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for 500 kV Kazakhstan - Kyrgyzstan (Almaty - Kemin) and 500 kV Shulbinsk HPP - Aktogai - Taldykorgan - Almaty Transmission Lines Projects including:</p>
<p>1. Evaluation of the technical feasibility of construction of two potential transmission line expansions;<br />2. Evaluation of the economic and financial feasibility, including potential risks of the construction, as well as potential funding sources of the construction of the two transmission line projects.</p>
<p>KEGOC owns and is responsible for operating the grid and all electric power high voltage (220 kilovolts and higher) transmission lines in Kazakhstan, which constitute about 24,000 kilometers (km) of transmission lines. As part of its system, KEGOC owns and operates 74 substations. The company is 100% owned by the national state holding company, Samruk-Kazyna. KEGOC invested more than $200 million in electric power transmission expansion and improvements in 2009, and over the next 15 years it plans to invest more than $3.5 billion. The company has prioritized transmission lines to Kyrgyzstan and to connect existing and future hydropower facilities with significant load centers (net consumption areas).</p>
<p>In particular, KEGOC is planning to construct a 920 kilometer (km) 500kV transmission line that will connect an existing hydropower plant at Shulbinsk (702 MW) and the planned 68 MW Bulak hydropower plant (which will also through water storage upstream allow for increased power delivery from Shulbinsk) to load centers in Aktogai (primarily to be used for electrification of a railway line) and Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan. A second 200km 500kV transmission line from Almaty to Kemin, Kyrgyzstan will connect Kazakhstan, which already imports some hydropower-generated electricity from Kyrgyzstan, to the expanding transmission grid in Kyrgyzstan, and potentially through Kyrgyzstan to Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $988,004 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is N00421-11-R-0017 and is issued as a request for proposal. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15. The requirement will be full and open and the place of performance will be an offsite location near Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, NAS Patuxent River is requesting Internet services for the following two locations: 1) Exploration IV and 2) Expedition IV, Lexington Park, MD. Services requested cover the procurement of circuit installation as well as monthly recurring charges. The circuits will temporarily feed internet connectivity to NMCI Deployable Site Transport Boundaries (DSTB) until a permanent DISA circuit and NMCI boundary can be procured. The following services requested in this SOW:</p>
<p>Provide a 1 GIG Fiber Port Internet Connection supplying 15 Mbps into a Navy provided CISCO 2811 with Dynamic IP Addresses to support 120 users at 46579 Expedition Drive (Bldg IV) suite 300, Lexington Park MD, 20653.<br /><br />The second location is to provide a 1 GIG Fiber Port Internet Connection supplying 7 Mbps into a Navy provided CISCO 2811 with Dynamic IP Addresses to support 60 users at 22299 Exploration Drive, (Bldg IV) suite 300, Lexington Park MD, 20653.</p>
<p>The NMCI DSTB is configured with the following data interfaces: a) dual T-1, b) single Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), c) single Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and d) single gigabit multi-mode fiber. In order to accommodate NMCI bandwidth requirements of the users within these spaces the only solution is to utilize the gigabit fiber interface. Early market research of data services availability indicates Verizon Business and Metrocast are the only suitable service provider in these geographic locations that can provide gigabit fiber connectivity</p>
<p>This action is required for the command to stay in compliance with force protection regulations governing occupancy. The command is currently in violation of these regulations in Exploration V and is realigning space allocations to new leased spaces (where these circuits will be installed). Given the criticality of the customer requirement utilizing the Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) CSA will be the most suitable method to acquire this solution in a timely manner.<br /><br /><br />The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at 52.212-2 is applicable to this requirement and the evaluation criteria to be used in paragraph (a) are as follows: technical capability, price and past performance are in descending order of importance.&nbsp;Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their offer. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and these additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition: 52.222-26, 52.232-33. DFARS 252.204-7004 "Required Central Contractor Registration" applies to all solicitations issued on/after 6/1/98. Lack of registration in CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your offer. Call 1-888-227-2423 or view at http://www.ccr.gov/for more information. The total fixed price&nbsp;will be the&nbsp;sum of all prices&nbsp;Awards will be made to the contractor(s) whose proposal is/are determined to be the&nbsp;lowest price technically accpectable&nbsp;based upon the above evaluation criteria. The Government may elect not to make any awards, or to make award to one or more contractors for any combination. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Send quotes via email to the attention of James Findlay, Email address: James.Findlay@Navy.mil. Quotes are due by 1400, 14 January 2011. For information regarding this announcement, contact James Findlay, Code 25157, at (301) 757-2657.</p>

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>E.7 FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)(Tailored)</p>
<p>The Government will award up to three (3) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 - Use of industry standard and/or non-proprietary tools.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Management Approach</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Management organization and business model.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 - Proposed organizational structure and staffing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Quality Control</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Quality Control &amp; Performance Monitoring.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Price/Cost<br /><br />Technical Approach, Management Approach, Quality Control, and Past Performance are listed in descending order of importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than price. As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.</p>
<p>a) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced.</p>
<p>b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />E.8 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND RELEVANT IMPORTANCE <br />The following criteria will be used in the evaluation of proposals:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors<br /><br />Factor 1: Technical Approach.</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), including development/enhancement and operations and maintenance activities. General statements that the offeror understands, can, or will perform the listed functions without supporting information/narrative is inadequate. Paraphrasing the PWS or parts thereof, is similarly inadequate, as are phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed" or "well-known techniques will be used." This volume shall be written to enable evaluators to make a thorough evaluation as to whether the services offered adequately respond to the specific Government requirements. The Technical Proposal shall clearly delineate the division of performance between the prime Contractor, Teaming Partners and the first-tier Subcontractor(s), if applicable. The offeror's technical approach shall address the sub-factors listed below:<br /><br />Sub-Factor 1: Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements. Offerors shall describe, in detail, the proposed technical approach for addressing the PWS requirements in their response. The offeror's proposal should also demonstrate their ability to protect the Coast Guard systems and the integrity and the confidentiality of the information contained within them. It is essential to the Coast Guard that protection of the infrastructure is met in order to meet mission-critical objectives. Offerors shall include a narrative discussion of their efficiencies and unique aspects of the technical approach. The proposal should include discussion of knowledge, experience and applied use of industry best practices. The offeror's technical approach should address the strategy for evaluating and recommending new and emerging technologies; hardware and software products related to security; the development of effective IT security guidance and policies that reduces the Coast Guard's vulnerabilities to cyber threats. The proposal should address the strategy for providing technical, administrative, and management security assistance as it relates to IT security incidents; Certification and Accreditation Support for sensitive and unclassified (SBU) Systems and Classified (C-LAN Systems across Coast Guard) systems; assistance in developing IA awareness and Information System Security training programs and TEMPEST support. The offeror's technical approach should address these strategies to support DHS, DOD, USCG missions and IT security operations. The offeror's proposal shall clearly demonstrate a sound approach to, and alignment with, the DHS 4300a and USCG COMDINST 5300.13b Information Assurance Manual as well as CJCSM 6510.01A Information Assurance (Ia) And Computer Network Defense (CND)Volume I (Incident Handling Program); DoD Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation. &amp; DoD Instruction 8500.1, Information Assurance (IA) Manual.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor must provide one documented example of IA Tactics Techniques Procedures (TTP) developed for the government by your organization. Provide at least one (1) example each of Incident Handling and Concept of Operations (CONOPS).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide one documented example of a successful Certification and Accreditation submission of a major application or system for a government agency to include agency name, project plans, documents completed, methodologies used and number of revisions required in the overall process.<br /><br />&bull; Contractor must show previous experience in providing Information System Security Officer duties by including one (1) example of how they have supported government agencies. This example shall show experience with DHS and or DoD mandated tools in support of ISSO duties. The example shall be supplemented by resumes of the ISSO.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor must provide one (1) example of how TEMPEST requirements and support have been met through previous contracts. The example shall include certification document or TEMPEST Field Technical Authority.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide a one-page narrative of procedures your company developed or implemented in support of Vulnerability Management and Scanning at a government agency including the name of the agency and POC information.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide a one-page narrative of procedures your company developed or implemented in support of IT Forensics.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2: Use of industry standard and/ornon-proprietary tools. <br /><br />&bull; Contractor shall provide a one-page narrative of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tools utilized in support of a government agency's computer network defense to include how the data was analyzed, the name of the agency and POC information.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Management Approach.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offerors's Management Approach/Plan for the purposes of determining how well their management plan demonstrates its ability to sustain adequate resources throughout the life of the IDIQ that will be needed to successfully meet all of the PWS requirements (see Attachment I). The management approach proposed by the Offeror is critical to the success of this effort. Therefore, the management approach must be explicitly explained and presented in the proposal so as to provide the USCG with a complete description of how the effort will be managed. The management approach shall clearly describe a complete understanding by task of the required actions, anticipated workload, labor needs by type, by providing resumes that outline relevant skills, experience and by describing management controls that will be established and used to monitor individual and/or overall tasks to include the mechanism for retaining the proposed labor skill mix. The management approach shall be evaluated as to how autonomous the Contract Program Manager is including lines of authority, contracting authority, hiring and removal plans; clearly defined security clearances and citizenship requirements; Teaming Partner arrangements, and Subcontractor teaming arrangements, including proposed prime/Teaming Partner/Subcontractor relationships, tasks to be performed by Teaming Partners/Subcontractors and authority/autonomy delegated to Subcontractors by prime Contractors; management and staffing practices, incentive and awards programs, recruiting methods, training plans and career development activities; clearly defined Key Personnel with inclusion of resumes; and response to changes in customer needs, tasking, and workload requirements. <br />The offeror's proposal should demonstrate its management approach with emphasis on the applied use of management controls, IT certification concepts and policies to ensure appropriate management and execution of Information Technology (IT) Information Assurance Security Management Services on the classified and unclassified IT infrastructure and their unique operational requirements and all applicable DHS and USCG security and performance standards applicable to these systems. The Offeror's management approach should clearly demonstrate their ability to deliver services and capabilities on-time, within budget, and with the required service quality. The offeror's proposed organizational structure and staffing should clearly demonstrate the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish all tasking in the PWS. <br />Offerors shall identify current information technology certifications held by key technical positions included in the proposal. Offerors shall address the extent to which the proposed key personnel have committed themselves to work on this effort. If the key personnel have worked on any of the contracts used in past performance, identification of those contracts and the role of key personnel should be stated.<br /><br />Sub-Factor 1: Management organization and business model. Offerors will be evaluated on their overall management organization and business model for accomplishing the requirements of the PWS. If teaming arrangements are proposed contractors shall clearly detail each team member's roles and responsibilities and size of business. The contractor shall also provide a list of all first tier sub-contractors. The proposal shall address the autonomy of the on-site Contract Program Manager with respect to management of all personnel, teaming members, Subcontractors, and overall execution of tasking under the IDIQ contract(s). The offeror's proposed organization and business model shall demonstrate relevant aspects including, but not limited to: proposed plan for utilizing a proposed approach to project planning and scheduling, tools for monitoring, controlling and reporting progress (including the progress of Subcontractors), and the proposed on-site management team for the prime Contractor/Teaming Partners and all proposed Subcontractors. The offeror's proposal shall describe the role of all proposed Teaming Members and Subcontractors in the overall management and execution of Contract tasking. <br /><br />&bull; Contractor shall provide one (1) example of procedures for recruiting, training and retention to fill vacant positions and maintain continuity of personnel.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2: Proposed organizational structure and staffing. The offeror's proposal will be evaluated on their proposed overall organizational and staffing structure, to include: (1) staffing levels that align personnel by proposed task and proposed labor category, and (2) staffing information to support their proposed level of effort for the tasking detailed in the PWS. The offerors will also be evaluated on the qualifications, education, experience, and availability of proposed key personnel. Resumes for key personnel, including past and/or current experience, education and/or training, along with statements of availability and letters of commitment from key personnel/Teaming Partners and Subcontractors, shall be submitted as part of the offeror's proposal. The offeror's proposed staffing structure shall also specifically address the offeror's approach to staffing positions requiring Top Secret (TS) and/or TS/SCI clearances to support certain Classified work at the C4IT Service Center (SC) as described in the PWS. <br /><br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel to perform all requirements in this contract. All Contractor employees supporting this contract shall be citizens of the United States, shall be able to read, write, speak and understand English. All Contractor employees supporting this IDIQ contract must be able to obtain and sustain a Secret Clearance throughout the duration of this contract. However, the Contractor may be required to have a Secret, Top Secret (TS), and Top Secret (TS) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). As a condition of privileged access to any information system, personnel performing IA functions as described in the Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, DoD 8570.01-M, must satisfy both preparatory and sustain DoD IA training and certification requirements (see DoD 8570.01-M, Chapters 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11). Additional guidance regarding these requirements will also be referenced in the Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, DoD 8570.01-M. <br /><br />Factor 3: Quality Control.<br /><br />Offerors shall describe their corporate Quality Control Program and how the corporate office will evaluate on-site quality control efforts. Quality control should address the method of ensuring the quality of delivered IT services and capabilities, as well as the accuracy of cost, labor, and invoice projections. The quality control program narrative should also include a discussion of the proposed methods for ensuring cost accountability through the use of efficient and effective solutions and alternatives.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1: Quality Control &amp; Performance Monitoring. The offerors will be evaluated on their proposed Quality Control Program. The Program should describe the offeror's ability to effectively utilize time, material and staff hours in an equitable manner to achieve the greatest results with a minimum of time and effort. The Program should likewise address the offerors approach to continuous improvement, capturing lessons learned, and sharing these lessons learned across all contracted personnel assigned to this Contract. Offerors shall describe the proposed on-site quality control process, including methods of monitoring performance to meet acceptable quality levels identified in the PWS, as well as established Performance Metrics, and shall propose additional measurable requirements and corresponding performance metrics. <br /><br />DO NOT submit a Quality Control Plan with your proposal. A comprehensive Quality Control Plan supporting the PWS requirements will be required after Contract award.<br /><br />&bull; Offerors must provide a copy of their quality control processes and procedures that are standard industry practiced. <br /><br />Factor 4: Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors with previous contract experience within the IT Information Assurance security environment should list and summarize their performance on similar or related contracts currently in progress or completed within the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references to include specific points of contact, e-mail addresses for those contacts, contract number, contract type, contract period of performance, and brief description of the requirement. In determining whether past performance information is relevant or not relevant, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule within the IT Information Assurance security environment. Offeror(s) may be asked for additional information about problems encountered and corrective actions taken when negative information has been submitted by references. If past performance information is either not relevant or not available, then the offeror will be rated neutral (neither favorably nor unfavorably). In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via the offeror's supplied references and federal sources to include the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).</p>
<p>To be considered relevant, the offeror must have been performed within the past three (3) years within the IT IA environment. All information and references are subject to verification by the Technical Evaluation Team. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the proposals received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and cost control and business relations. A list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts completed during the past 3 years, a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts currently in progress, or a combination of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts that have either been completed in the past 3 years or are currently in progress. Similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders, and/or subcontracts listed may include any contract, delivery order, purchase order and/or subcontract larger than $2,500 entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts shall list similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts as required above for proposed key personnel. Provide the following information for each contract, delivery order, purchase order, and/or subcontract:</p>
<p>(A) Name of Contracting Activity<br />(B) Contract Number<br />(C) Contract Type<br />(D) Total Contract Value<br />(E) Description of Contract Work<br />(F) Contracting Officer (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No.<br />(G) Program Manager (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. (if applicable)<br />(H) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No.<br />(I) Administrative Contracting Officer (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. (if different from F)<br />(J) List of teaming partners/first-tier subcontractors (if applicable)</p>
<p>The offeror may provide information on both problems encountered and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems on the contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts identified. The offeror should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated in terms of Quality of Technical Services and Approach, Quality of Contract Management and Management Approach, and Customer Satisfaction. Each contract shall only be referenced once. Past performance information should be provided for services directly relevant to the services to be performed under the IDIQ PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three (3) years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the quotations received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, cost control and business relations.<br /><br />Factor 5: Price/Cost</p>
<p>Offerors are to submit price proposals that provide complete pricing for services in accordance with the Performance Work Statement and Attachment II - IT IA Pricing Table. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of overall price or reflective of an inherent lack of management and/or technical competence or comprehension of the requirements shall be further excluded from evaluation.<br /><br />&bull; Total Evaluated Price. Price Analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. Total evaluated price will be calculated on the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers [see Section B.1]. In establishing the reasonableness of the offered prices, only information that is necessary to determine price reasonableness must be utilized. No additional information from the offeror is necessary if the price is based on adequate price competition.</p>
<p>Information other than cost or pricing data that may be evaluated during a price reasonableness determination is as follows: <br /><br />&bull; Information related to prices (e.g., established catalog or market prices or previous contract prices), relying first on information available within the Government; second, on information obtained from sources other than the offeror; and, if necessary, on information obtained from the offeror. When obtaining information from the offeror is necessary, such information submitted by the offeror shall include, at minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror's proposals will also be evaluated for price realism by comparing their proposed prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is based on historical prices for similar services that have been procured during the last five years as well as labor rates from GSA Schedules.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete Section B. 1. and the IT IA Pricing - Attachment II of the solicitation including all fixed price line items and cost-reimbursable amounts. Offerors shall not deviate from the estimated amounts provided for the cost reimbursable CLINs.</p>
<p>Offerors shall calculate total for each line item by multiplying the quantity by the unit price. Offerors shall provide a subtotal for each year and an overall total price for the life of the contract. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of separately priced line items shall not obligate the Government to purchase separately priced line items. The Government may, at its discretion, accept any or all separately priced line items proposed by an awardee, if that awardees proposal for separately priced line items is sufficiently attractive.</p>
<p>The primary means of determining the "fairness and reasonableness" of proposed prices will be through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in overall price shall be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Technical Approach, Management Approach, Quality Control and Past Performance are listed in descending order of importance , and when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>E.9 BASIS FOR AWARD - TRADE-OFF SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS <br /><br />The Government will award up to three (3) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered. Prospective offerors are advised that in consideration of Best Value a proposal meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher priced offeror is determined to be more advantageous to the Government.</p>

<p>(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed <br />directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government <br />Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) <br />by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of<br />filing a protest with the GAO.</p>
<p>COMMANDANT CG-9121(WS)<br />U.S. COAST GUARD <br />2100 2ND Street, SW STOP 7112 <br />Washington, DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The Air Force Materiel Command, 772nd Enterprise Souring Squadron (ESS)/PKS, Lackland AFB, TX is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for the next Independent Science, Engineering, and Acquisition Support (ISEAS) contract. This contract is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) of the highest technical degree, in extremely selective domains not relevant to AFCEE's large-scale A&amp;AS execution-leveraging, known as Global Engineering Integration and Technical Assistance (GEITA). AFCEE's ISEAS contract capability and needs have been and still are extremely limited with respect to volume (less than seven percent of AFCEE's overall A&amp;AS expenditures). AFCEE's ISEAS contract capability has existed since its earliest organizational days (early 1990s), and has been harnessed through non-competitive direct award contracts;<strong>however, it is our endeavor to</strong> <strong>determine if a competitive environemnt exists.</strong>Factors such as the specifics of this unique portion of AFCEE's overall A&amp;AS requirements, how they manifest themselves, the interactive stakeholder and operative domains prevalent in the requirements' framework, and, most importantly, the absolute need for renowned, universally credible highest technical operatives, mandates that AFCEE continue to harness an ISEAS capability.&nbsp;In these relatively small areas of endeavor, AFCEE's ability to engage in and contribute to the success of DoD's programs that fall within its charter hinges on its access to and employment of a highest-level science and engineering arm which is totally independent in its corporate profile; totally free of organizational conflict with regards to other firms traversing AFCEE's and DoD's vast mission landscape; autonomous in how it receives, processes, and engages in the various tasks germane to its scope; totally non-competitive with regards to Government work; and accepted as bias-free, totally objective and immediately credible in how they exert their technically defensible contributions in support of AFCEE's mission. Accordingly, AFCEE anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a basic ordering period of three years and oneadditional year for completion of performance and&nbsp;a Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee pricing arrangement. The NAICS code for this work is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The program ceiling for this contract is estimated to be $20 million for the three year total spanning 2011 through 2013. The following quetions have been developed to assist AFCEE in determinng industry capability to meet the requirements of this program. <strong>Interested parties should submit their answers for determination of their qualifications. <br /><br /></strong>1. What are industry's experiences (i.e. your firm's experiences) supporting the types of technical functions and domains, in totality, prescribed in the attached PWS, and further addressed in the following questions, with the high technical levels of effort and resources necessary to fulfill AFCEE's needs relevant to the &lsquo;recognized expert', corporate autonomy, and conflict and bias-free nature of the ISEAS' independent standing and mission role?</p>
<p>2. If in your firm's profile, question # 1 seems to be covered (i.e. favorable), what is your firm's historical maximum work load and range of dispersion of work performed simultaneously? For whom did your firm provide these services, and under what type of contract?</p>
<p>3. If in your firm's profile, question # 1 seems to be covered (i.e. favorable), tell us how you would manage and perform the full scope of AFCEE's ISEAS requirements, including the manner of interaction with AFCEE and its customer and stakeholder base relevant to subject functions/domains and the associated requirements' manifestation (individual examples of technical functions/domains are portrayed in question numbers four through 10 below).</p>
<p>4. What are your firm's experiences in providing scientists, risk-assessors, and engineers considered leaders in their fields with reputations beyond reproach in supporting technical evaluation and transfer through independent engineering evaluation and assessment of technical data associated with the deployment of leading edge environmental technologies and controversial topics such as appropriate cleanup standards for environmental contaminants? If your firm has this experience and capability, has your firm done this work in the DoD ERA program, the MMRP, and the One Cleanup program? Has your firm conducted independent engineering evaluation and validation of DoD environmental needs, validating technology solutions and implementation plans? Has your firm provided education and training through outreach and partnerships? Has your firm worked in any of the various methods whereby Technology Transfer is accomplished: Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), restoration workshops, partnerships with industry/academia, and agreements such as the Interstate Technology Regulatory Council (ITRC) support per a DoD interagency agreement? Has your firm performed industrial oversight by reviewing and evaluating industry performance in environmental programs, reporting data, findings, results, and recommendations using high caliber experts, whose reputation in the field is impeccable, to avoid undue criticism, litigation and program delays, and fostering a confidence of total objectivity? In these endeavors, has your firm assisted your client by assessing and making recommendations on requirements pursuant to acquisition endeavors, crafting and reviewing Requests for Proposal, evaluation criteria, and other acquisition documents such as Broad Agency Announcements and the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (SERDP/ESTCP)?</p>
<p>5. What is your firm's expertise base and experiences in supporting emerging contaminants? Has your firm provided support to a client's such activities where chemical compounds, perchlorate, and other emerging issues and evolving contaminants were the topic of expertise?

<p>6. What are your firm's experiences in assisting in a client's Technology Transfer Program? Has your firm identified, collected, analyzed, validated, and approved a client's environmental requirements using innovative conflict-free personnel for technology program and budget solutions, oversight and planning and execution? Similarly, does your firm possess the corporate standing and continuity to assist its client in these such endeavors as environmental needs change over time, as needs are identified and solutions are implemented, and as the flavor of the needs addressed through a Technology Transfer program changes over time, impacting budgetary and other programming aspects?</p>
<p>7. What are your firm's experiences in the forensic chemistry domain, as in providing the client with general and project-specific research and development support to identify and apply new and improved tools, diagnostics and methodologies in environmental forensic chemistry to augment initiatives in sampling, monitoring, characterization and system optimization? Has your firm done work in evaluating source apportionment issues, degradation as a performance indicator of remedial progress, methods for emerging contaminants, and natural/anthropogenic background levels?</p>
<p>8. What are your firm's experiences in providing high-level support to evaluate, develop and implement quality assurance processes and programs for its client's products and services? Is your firm experienced at updating, revising, and developing guidance/requirements documents such as, but not limited to the following: Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP), Model Work Plans (WP), Model Field Sampling Plans (FSP), Technical Services, Environmental Chemistry Analytical Protocols, Risk Assessment Methods, and Performance Evaluation (PE) and laboratory authenticity programs?</p>
<p>9.

In addition to the above, has your firm provided support to a client in other forms of decision support analyses?</p>
<p>10. What are your firm's experiences in providing conflict-of-interest-free specialized expertise aligned with the domains relevant to and assisting clients in their Technical Assistance Visits (TAV) regarding time-critical requirements? Explain if the clients' locations (where the TAVs were performed) were military installations/organizations, project sites, or another type of operation or agency. Has your firm's TAV-related experience included specialized restoration assessments, complex hydrology/geology studies, toxicological studies, litigation support, emerging issues/contaminants, and/or risk communication?</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Contractor Test First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 

Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

<DESC>This Notice is modified to extend the due date from January 12, 2011 to January 21, 2011.<br /><br />This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 21, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the National Science Foundation (NSF) in conducting market research to determine the interest and capabilities of qualified companies/agencies for the opportunity described in the attachment. This request is for information purposes only to help NSF gain a better understanding of potential solutions and overall costs. Responses will assist NSF in developing the acqui-sition strategy including the alternatives analysis and in determining the appropriate approach for acquir-ing the systems implementation services, hosting and application management shared services, and soft-ware. Respondents must identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Vendors are encouraged to limit their use of sensitive and proprietary information. However should responses contain sensitive and proprietary information, the information will be handled accordingly. Any informa-tion submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such informa-tion. This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will not award a contract pursuant to this an-nouncement. No solicitation package is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response. Please do not contact the NSF CFO and CIO or their staff at this time. NSF has contracted with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) under NSFDACS08D1596 for financial management modernization planning support, among other services. As part of the financial management modernization planning support task, PwC is required to assist NSF in conducting market research. Part of the market research includes the development of the RFI and review of responses resulting from the issuance of the RFI. In accordance with Part 9 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) it has been determined that as a result of receiving award NSFDACS08D1596, an organizational conflict exists which will prohibit PwC from proposing on the design, development, and implementation effort that may result from this RFI. Further, PwC is bound by confidentiality of information provisions under their con-tract with NSF.

As part of the contractual relationship that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), PwC is required to enter into Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) with the respondents to this RFI. That said, PwC has requested that the NSF attach the NDA, request respondents to sign the NDA and submit with their responses to this RFI. PwC will then counter-sign the NDA and return to the respondent prior to information be provided to PwC. It is imperative that NDAs be put in place as expeditiously as possible in order to ensure the NSF's project remains on schedule. Please note the change in the due date of respones. Responses are now due on Monday, April 13, 2009 at 5:00pm.

<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide FAA management and executive leadership training instructional support services.  The market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA 8(a) certified small businesses.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine the FAA's acquisition strategy for the prospective contract requirement.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA intends to establish an instructional services contract by August 2012.
Potential sources of these services are expected to be categorized in the Sector 611430 of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

The Small Business size standard for NAICS 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training) is $7.0 Million dollars.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  When a Request for Proposal is issued the FAA may decide to issue the Screening Information Request for full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.

Notice of Intent to Award Sole source Contract to: CQ-Roll Call Group / Roll Call Inc. to provide a subscription to CQ.com. <br />Intention: Award a FFP contract for a CQ.com subscription to CQ-Roll Call Group / Roll Call Inc. Justification: supplies or services required are available from one or a limited number of responsible sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Mr. Howard Marks, ASC/AQ, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Mr. Marks can be reached at (937) 255-8642, e-mail: howard.marks@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC><p>The Government has awarded a four-month sole-source contract to Science Applications International Corporations (SAIC) IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1 (see attached J&amp;A). This bridge contract is necessary to continue to meet mission critical requirements, mitigate the impact of personnel turnover, and to support transition to competitively awarded follow-on contracts. The period of performance of this bridge effort will be 1 January 2011 through 30 April 2011. This sole-source A&amp;AS effort will support the Air Force's immediate need to bridge a gap in service from the end of our current A&amp;AS contract which expires 31 December 2010 until competitive source selection can be completed which is anticipated by April 2011. The&nbsp;contract will provide Advisory and Assistance Services to support or improve policy development, management, and administration; and improve operation of systems supporting the Air Force Space Command mission. This effort will also support several phases of planning, programming, sustainment, and implementation cycles of various government satellite systems, and complements the Government's technical expertise in accomplishing particular space-related missions.</p>

<AWDNBR>HSCEDM-11-F-00009
<DESC>This is a special notice to award a contract extension on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" to The Geo Group for detention and guard services at the South Texas Detention Center (STDC) for a two month base period, December 26, 2010 through February 25, 2011. This contract extension is necessary while actions are completed for the follow-on competition resulting in a single contract award for the management of the STDC. This extension also includes 2- two month option periods which may be exercised if needed.
<p>The primary mission of STDC is the detention and transportation of aliens in removal proceedings, and aliens subject to final order of removal. STDC provides detention services within the San Antonio Area of Responsibility (AOR) because illegal immigrants filter through the state on a regular basis. Law enforcement officials in Texas and other southern states, including ERO detain significant numbers of illegal immigrants. As a result of these apprehension and detention activities, a contract for detention services is necessary. <br />The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561210. <br />This special notice of intent to award a contract extension on a sole source basis is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries must be addressed in writing to the Department of Homeland Security/Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Acquisitions, Detention Management, DC Division, 801 I Street NW, Suite 910-29, Washington, DC 20536 or e-mailed to Amy.Wire@dhs.gov. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Response to this notice is not required.</p>
