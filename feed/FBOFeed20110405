<DESC>Synopsis for Engineering and Technical Support for Shelter, Radome and Tower Systems
<p>The Tactical Shelters Office (OO-ALC/GHSCC) provides worldwide mobile depot maintenance support to numerous weapon systems that are owned by USAF Major Commands, DoD, and other federal agencies. This requirement is for engineering services. Individual task orders to be placed on this contract will include sustaining engineering tasks, development engineering tasks and maintenance engineering tasks.</p>
<p>The Tactical Shelters Office is currently developing advanced composites to replace existing shelters, radomes and towers. We are currently implementing this new technology in our products which requires new technical data creation and analysis. Because our office tracks and performs depot maintenance for shelters, radomes and towers worldwide, baseline configuration and operational support is required for these efforts. This effort will not include field repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>This effort is a 100% Set-aside to Small Business and is restricted to Small Business offerors.</p>
<p>The contractor shall have technical expertise in order to fulfill the requirements of this contract. The contractor shall have:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge related to conventional shelter, radome and tower systems; including rapid modification of existing systems to meet the dynamic needs of the warfighter</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/ knowledge relative to the design, development, test, and implementation of advanced composites shelter, radome and tower systems</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge supporting the inclusion of reduced energy consumption and adapted energy saving/management technologies. Example technologies include: wind, solar, waste-to-energy, smart-grid/micro-grid technologies, and other emerging technologies</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge supporting the assessment and inclusion of shelter armoring technologies; thereby increasing the safety of personnel and the protection of critical deployed assets</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge related to Configuration Management, OSS&amp;E and Systems Engineering principles and how they relate to the Combat &amp; Mission Support Branch family of systems.</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge related to information systems to comply with applicable standards of data input into USAF electronic data systems</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge related to potential design and material solutions for fielded Combat &amp; Mission Support Branch family of systems that have major deficiencies, including corrosion control</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge related to Engineering/Technical Data Packages</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge with UID process</p>
<p>&bull; Experience/knowledge with ANSI standards relating to shelters, radomes and towers</p>

<p>The contractor shall perform tasks in accordance with separately issued Task Orders providing services as specified therein.</p>
<p>The contractor shall use a systems engineering approach in the accomplishment of system design, engineering, development and manufacturing efforts; which in turn shall ensure that mission objectives and weapon system requirements relating to individual Task Orders are met. Tasks may require interaction outside of the Shelter's office such as with other contractors and on-base maintenance personnel and with other organizations and agencies.</p>
<p>The following specific tasks may be applied to Individual Task Orders:</p>
<p>&bull; Systems engineering support<br />&bull; Analytical engineering<br />&bull; System integration<br />&bull; Independent engineering tests and validation<br />&bull; Development of engineering concepts<br />&bull; Reliability and maintainability analyses<br />&bull; Environmental impact studies<br />&bull; Energy and Power Systems Improvement<br />&bull; Process improvement<br />&bull; Development/qualification of new or obsolete items<br />&bull; New design/reverse engineering.<br />&bull; Design packages<br />&bull; Field support<br />&bull; Create/update ASTM Specifications<br />&bull; Create/update Technical Orders, manuals, drawings<br />&bull; Technical Data Research<br />&bull; Support for conferences and Technical Interchange<br />&bull; Configuration management</p>

<DESC>****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO: Darryl Wright, Contract Specialist, email: darryl.wright2@us.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted. The AMCOM Contracting Center proposes to award a contract for tactical and non-tactical, Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF)/Commercial Equivalent Equipment (CEE)/Electro-Optics Test Station (EOTS)/Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF)/Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS) Repair and Calibration of Secondary Items for Fiscal Year 2012 through FY 2016, by other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman Corporation, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL  60008-1098, (Cage Code: 26916).  The new contract will be a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ), consisting of the repair and calibration items which are planned to be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF).  The repair of tactical and non-tactical Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) will have a maximum ceiling for number of repairs.  The repair and calibration portion of this contract cannot be adequately defined to develop a fixed price as there are various levels of repair required.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman Corp.  The Government suggest that small business firms, or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with this procurement, make contact with the firm(s) listed.  This acquisition covers potential future requirements for five (5) years; however, this does not preclude the Government from ordering the maximum quantity at any time during the requirements period.  Orders will be issued one or more times as repair and return materialize.   <br>Below is the complete listing of Repair and Calibration items:<br> <br> 	NSN	PART NUMBER/MODEL

Basis for Award:The Government plans to award a single firm fixed price Blanket Purchase Agreement and call order under that BPA to the quote that represents the lowest priced and meets the requirements and the specifics of the attachment.  Under this evaluation approach, a quote would not receive any additional credit for exceeding the requirements  described in this announcement. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the American College of Emergency Physicians, Emergency Medicine Foundation, 1125 Executive Circle, Irving, Texas 75038 for the acquisition of Guidelines for Use of Opioid Analgesics for Acute or Chronic Pain in Emergency Departments.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.<br /><br />The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is the oldest and largest organization representing Emergency Departments (ED) physicians in the U.S. and it alone yields the influence, expertise, and recognition within the emergency medical field to develop and disseminate such guidelines. Established in 1968, ACEP has over 28,000 members and publishes the Annals of Emergency Medicine, the most cited and impactful emergency medicine journal. More importantly, ACEP is uniquely qualified to draft, review, and disseminate the kinds of guidelines with the authority and credibility needed by practitioners in EDs across the country.<br />&nbsp;
<p>ACEP follows an established, rigorous process to develop accurate and timely evidence-based clinical guidelines for ED physicians. After ACEP's Board of Directors approves a topic for clinical policy development, a subcommittee composed of experts in the topic area develops the key questions and the guidelines will seek to answer and performs a meticulous literature review. Subcommittee members evaluate every article used to form the clinical policy, classifying the sources by the strength of their evidence and grading the articles on six dimensions considered the most relevant to the development of clinical guidelines. Before publication, ACEP solicits comments from its Board, Council Officers, and a reputable network of expert reviewers. Once approved, the guidelines are published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine and placed on ACEP's website, where they are viewable by non-members. Even after publication, ACEP periodically reviews guidelines to ensure they remain accurate.</p>
<p>A different organization will not be able to attract the leading experts on the topic to participate in the expert panel. Additionally, any guidelines generated by another source will not have sufficient credibility to make them a standard of care in emergency departments. As a result, emergency departments will be much less likely to adopt the guidelines if they are not generated by ACEP; thus CDC will have much less impact upon this health problem.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the American College of Emergency Physicians, Emergency Medicine Foundation. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13327 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 19, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Unattended Ground Sensor Technology</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not at this time seeking proposals. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov). Interested parties are advised to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>CBP is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whose mission is prevent the illegal flow of people and goods across U.S. air, land, and sea borders while expediting the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce. As the nation's single, unified border agency, CBP's mission is vitally important for the protection of the American people and the national economy. <br /><br />CBP represents the first line of defense of America's borders. One of CBP's strategic <br />objectives is to establish and maintain effective control of air, land, and maritime borders <br />with the appropriate mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel. An integral component to this situational awareness is the use of unattended ground sensor technology that provides information on the location of potential illegal border entries.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>CBP consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for unattended ground sensor technology. CBP plans to utilize unattended ground sensor technology to enhance agents' ability to detect, track, identify, and classify illegal incursions and to provide CBP agents with improved situational awareness between the Ports of Entry (POE). The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market.</p>
<p>CBP is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated unattended ground sensor technology systems described in the following sections. CBP intends to deploy these sensors as part of a tailored, layered approach to improve situational awareness along the U.S. Southwest Border. There is no intent to develop any items or systems under this program. CBP intends to make maximum use of an open systems approach and desires the system to be in full production as defined by Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) Publication Number: 09-01.03.02.13-02.</p>
<p>Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist CBP in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.</p>

Prospective bidders are advised that these three listings are not purely geographic and that a requirement on either the Chugach (Anchorage) or Tongass (Ketchikan) National Forest may be posted under the Regional Office (Juneau) listing. Thus, prospective bidders seeking Forest Service opportunities in Alaska should visit both the appropriate Forest listing (Anchorage or Ketchikan) as well as the Regional listing (Juneau).

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6074, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><strong><br />Description<br /></strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Wayne State University, College of Engineering, 5050 Anthony Wayne Drive, Detroit, MI 48202 to characterize and map the Raman signature of 88 frozen tissue specimens collected in the Polish Women's Health Study.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1).<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million. <br /><br />Period of performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award. Only one (1) firm fixed price type contract will be awarded.<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) investigators have made advances in the study of breast cancer etiology and considerations of new strategies for prevention and treatment through and increased understanding of differences in risk factors and biology between breast cancer subtypes. Recently, several studies have shown that molecular differences in tumor tissues between subtypes are mirrored in benign tissues surrounding these tumors. Amassing data strongly suggest that the breast microenvironment (i.e. stromal - epithelial interactions) influences both the risk of breast cancer and the biological, molecular and clinical characteristics of tumors that develop. <br /><br />The objective of this procurement is to characterize and map the Raman signature of 88 frozen tissue specimens collected in the Polish Women's Health Study using an internal standard to enable peak height quantification. Specifically, the NCI will assess paired samples of cancer and non-cancer tissues from 44 women, including 22 with basal cancers and 22 with luminal A tumors defined by mRNA profiling, matched on age and grade. These data will be compared to gene expression profiles of the matched tissues, other pathology data and information about risk factors and survival.<br /><br />Wayne State University has vast experience applying Raman spectroscopy to human tissues and has published findings related to this work, which include analysis of tissues adjacent to breast cancer. In addition, the laboratory possesses special capabilities include multi-wavelength Raman technology, mapping techniques and unique processing and analytical algorithms. In addition, the contractor's staffing is adequate to perform the extensive tasks of this contract within a one-year timeframe, and includes the ability to interact with pathologists and molecular pathologists within the institution as needed. The contractor's laboratory has previously demonstrated the feasibility of Raman characterization of frozen tissues from the Polish Study. Dr. Auner, Program Director, Smart Sensors and Integrated Microsystems (SSIM) Program, Wayne State University, College of Engineering has developed and validated many Raman signatures in both rodent and human tissues, including cell tumors of childhood, lymphomas, myc gene amplification, T cell activation, matrix metalloproteinases, methicilinn resistant Staphylococcus aureus and strains of HIN influenza virus. Wayne State University possess a unique combination of expertise, experience, equipment, staff and Raman database required to complete this work rapidly within timeframe and budget.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 11:00 AM EST on April 20, 2011. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed&nbsp;(301) 402-4513 or emailed to Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)<br />Integrated Document Production Division (IDP)<br />Optical Memory Card Consumables</p>
<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Sources Sought Notice (SSN)<br />Solicitation No.: IDP-Optical Cards<br />Posted Date: April, 4, 2011<br />Response Date: April 15, 2011<br />Classification Code: R - Commercial Product <br />Set Aside: <br />NAICS Code: 334613 Magnetic and Optical Recording Media Manufacturing</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE<br />This SSN is for informational and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a solicitation or a commitment to issue a solicitation. It is issued for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to determine industry capabilities, including those of small businesses, to meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>No solicitation is being issued at this time and the Government makes no assertion that a solicitation will be issued. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND<br />USCIS administers the Immigration and Nationality laws of the United States. As part of its statutory mission, USCIS is required to provide timely evidence of immigration status to its customers.</p>
<p>The Integrated Document Production (IDP) Division is a component of USCIS that produces Permanent Resident Cards (PRCs), which serve as evidence of foreigners being granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States. PRCs are very secure identity cards produced with optical memory technology and are personalized, using custom developed card personalization platforms. PRCs serve as proof of immigration status and allow bearers to live and work in the United States, consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act. These cards are custom designed and contain embedded security features and other specialized physical characteristics that make them unique to USCIS.</p>
<p>Currently, over 23 million optical memory cards have been personalized by IDP. USCIS expects to continue to produce approximately 2.9 million personalized optical memory cards annually. The IDP workload may increase or decrease based on a number of factors, including changes brought about by technological advances, USCIS reorganizations, implementation of new laws and policies, changes in United States Government administration, and/or changing global events. It is possible that the volume of card production could increase to as many as 14 million cards per year if major immigration reform legislation is enacted.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is conducting studies forcommercial data services related to satellite-to-ground data transmission, archiving, anddistribution in the continental US. The studies are intended to outline commercialsolutions to the need to distribute the data for future NASA payloads on commercialcommunications satellites supporting science and technology missions from geostationary(GEO) orbits.  Data will be transmitted by the commercial host spacecraft to a groundstation (see Figure 1 in Attachment 1).  From there, the data will be distributed tousers.	A reverse data link from the payload operations control center to the payload onthe commercial host is also required.  The process of developing and operating thepayload within the constraints of the hosted payload process is a new development methodfor NASA.  The distribution of the payload data in real-time, or near real-time, overcommercial networks is also a new operational concept for NASA.  Successful concepts inboth areas are expected to open the opportunities for scientific and engineering payloadsto operate in a commercially sustainable manner in the future.The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information to support the formulation of a futuremission using commercial geostationary capabilities and to investigate options forprocuring uplink and downlink data services to the commercial host for a NASA payload andground data distribution support for operations of a future mission.An example reference payload for such a mission would be an earth-imaging system coveringselected bands in the IR through the UV spectrum, a large format imaging detectorgenerating over 1Mpixel per image, support electronics for power and thermal management,on-board computing for processing schedule-driven commands and for packaging science andstate-of-health data for transmission to the ground.  The payload is expected to requirean 80 Mbps downlink and may be able to provide processing support for data compressionand rate buffering, if required.The payload will transmit its science data and supporting health and status data to theground using the capabilities of the commercial host.  That data will then be distributedto the payload control center and scientific partners.	The payload control center willtransmit commands to the hosted payload as needed to schedule operations and maintainperformance.  The end-to-end data routing and distribution between the NASA controlcenter, the scientific partners, and the commercial satellite point of presence will besustained using commercial networks.  The link between the teleport and the commercialhost will be sustained through the appropriate links for the commercial host.Nominally the hosted payload will operate on a 24x7 basis.  However, the payload is asecondary on the commercial host and the commercial host may suspend operations as deemednecessary for host operational safety.	Additionally, the payload may suspend operationsduring times of station-keeping maneuvers or eclipses.	The payload is being designed fora lifetime between 3 and 10 years.The hosted payload will be operated from a NASA payload control center.  Forconceptualization purposes, we will assume this will reside at NASA Langley ResearchCenter.  This will be the only authorized point of origin for commands to the hostedpayload either by direct output from the control center or by an operator using thecontrol center as a remote proxy.The hosted payload science and health and safety payload data will be delivered to thepayload control center.  Data will also be delivered to the cooperating science centers. For conceptualization purposes, we are assuming one additional site located in Colorado.NASA solicits industrys questions, comments, and areas for the government to considerrelative to this concept.  In addition to the general comments, the government seeksanswers to the specific questions provided in Attachment 1.ObjectivesThe Objectives of this RFI are as follows:	Gather information from industry on the conceptual approach to the datanetworking and identify any recommended alternative approaches	Identify industry capabilities to meet the required capabilities and identifyareas that affect cost, risk, and schedule	Support the development strategy for a potential acquisitionResponsesThis section contains all information required to submit a response.

NIH-OGC provides trademark searching and counseling; filing and prosecution of trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; international trademark procurement and prosecution; brand management and counseling; domestic and international trademark licensing; and pre-litigation counseling and dispute resolution. Some of this work will be assigned to the Contractor. After considering the individual requirements, the work will be assigned through the issuance of a Task Order by NIH-OGC. Trademark search services, including domestic and international trademark searching and clearance and trademark infringement and validity searches, will be required.<br /><br />The contractor shall perform all necessary and appropriate services in connection with the filing of trademark registration applications as required and at the direction of NIH-OGC. All foreign trademark matters shall be handled by the contractor, or foreign associates under the direction of the contractor, in accordance with the applicable statues, regulations, and case law of the particular foreign jurisdiction. The trademark prosecution services to be provided to NIH-OGC are generally to be considered equivalent to those of "In-House Counsel" and are not to be considered merely equivalent to "Overflow Work."<br /><br />The contractor shall, at the direction of NIH-OGC, file oppositions and cancellations with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), and take necessary actions to represent NIH-OGC. The contractor shall work closely with the attorneys and staff at NIH-OGC throughout opposition and cancellation proceedings. The contractor shall, upon request, provide counseling services to NIH-OGC about select licensing domestic and international licensing matters. The field of use of the license may vary. The contractor shall, upon request, consult with NIH-OGC on U.S. anti-counterfeiting matters, which includes the development of anti-counterfeiting strategies. The contractor may be asked to assist NIH-OGC with anti-counterfeiting matters before the U.S. Customs Service. Also, the contractor, through an appropriate foreign associate, shall represent NIH-OGC in anti-counterfeiting matters outside of the United States.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to maintain a current case docket to ensure that actions are taken and fees paid on a timely basis. Generally, NIH-OGC will be responsible for the payment of all maintenance fees on U.S. and foreign trademarks and applications. The work will often require very quick turn-around times, sometimes as short as one or two days, and coverage every business day to make sure that Trademark Office deadlines can always be complied with. <br /><br />A strong and deeply staffed corporate infrastructure will be necessary to make sure that there are sufficient personnel to satisfy the expected episodic need for filing labor intensive oppositions and other administrative dispute remedies. It is possible that we could have two or three oppositions on-going simultaneously, and we would expect the contractor to be able to handle that volume of work.<br /><br />The contractor may be required to evaluate complex trademark law matters on validity and infringement and prepare validity and infringement reports. The contractor may also be required to provide litigation support and services. Some ancillary trademark services may also be required, like obtaining copies of trademarks, file histories, assignment records, as requested; obtaining signatures of designated authorities on legal papers and deliver to the USPTO and/or foreign offices under very tight time constraints; recording trademark licenses with foreign intellectual property offices; resolving domain name disputes; registering domain names and providing courier service.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directions:</span></strong> Firms responding to this market survey should respond to all of the requirements above demonstrating capability. Responses should be concise with only the pertinent information requested, not to exceed 10 single-spaced pages. If you believe that your company has existing qualified personnel, relevant past performance experience, and the technical capability to perform the type of work described above, please submit the following information:<br />1. Company name and mailing address<br />2. Company point of contact<br />3. Capabilities statement describing the ability to perform the summarized scope of work along with past experience of a similar scope, size, complexity and relevance within the past 3 years. Provide the name of the project, contract number, value, and period of performance. <br /><br />If subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to meet the requirements, the prime contractor must demonstrate the ability to deliver the technical capabilities and maintain adequate labor, management and financial control of the project. The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541110 size standard $7.0 million. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.</p>

Interested parties to this RFI are requested to respond in Microsoft Word and are limited to 15 pages (including cover page and administrative page), text in Times New Roman 12pt, and one inch margins.
 The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:

1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) proprietary with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.

2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 3 below).
 Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.

3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.

4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.
 Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends proprietary portion begins: and proprietary portion ends.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total/broad Government or specific requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0934<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 2, Over The Head, Orange w/ Silver Trim, One-Size Fits All<br />Description: Vest, safety, ANSI Class 2, over the head, orange with silver trim, one-size fits all.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0935<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Medium<br />Description: Vest, safety, ANSI 107 compliant, Class 2, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size medium.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0936<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Large <br />Description: Vest, safety, ANSI 107 compliant, Class 2, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size large.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0937<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, XLar<br />Description: Vest, safety, ANSI 107 compliant, Class 2, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size extra large.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0938<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 2, Over The Head, Lime w/ Silver Trim, One-Size Fits All<br />Description: Vest, safety, ANSI Class 2, over the head, lime with silver trim, one-size fits all.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0934<br />Similar Items: 8145-Reg, 8415-00-177-4974, GFLR031760</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0935<br />Similar Items: RTSECOGYSM, CSV400, 3079-00014, 21187, 8023-M, 8081-M, VA321RX4, 8205HL/Y61241</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0936<br />Similar Items: CSV400, 3079-00003, 21187</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0937<br />Similar Items: CSV400, 21187, 3079-00004</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0938<br />Similar Items: 8145-Reg, 8415-00-177-4974, GFLR031760</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 19, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>SUBJECT LINE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN SCIENCE &amp; ENGINEERING (AS&amp;E) FOR PURCHASE OF 2 GEMINI X-RAY INSPECTION SYSTEMS
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with American Science &amp; Engineering (AS&amp;E) for the purchase of 2 Gemini x-ray inspection systems. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The AS&amp;E Gemini x-ray inspection system, with the Z Backscatter technology, is the agency standard used throughout the NRC Headquarters and satellite office buildings. The Z Backscatter system and technology is only manufactured by, purchased from and maintained by AS&amp;E. It is important that NRC is consistent with the x-ray inspection system due to the movement of the security guard force from post to post as well as the movement of mailroom personnel who all need to be trained on these machines. With the procurement of these Gemini X-Ray machines, the NRC will remain consistent with the established standard as the organization expands. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334517. This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted electronically to valerie.whipple@nrc.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on April 20, 2011. Telephonic responses and response providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.</p>

<DESC><p>The Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using the Simplified Acquisition procedures to National council on Patient Information and Education located at 4915 Saint Elmo Ave Ste 505, Bethesda, MD 20814-6082.</p>
<p>Description: Talking about Prescription Medicine Abuse: A National Multi-Media Outreach Campaign Addressing Prescription Medicine Misuse by Youth ages 12-17 and Young Adults ages 18-25 and Engaging Youth and Young Adults in Recovery - Based Leadership Roles.</p>
<p>Youth and Young adults experience recovery from substance use disorders and mental health conditions much differently than adults. They also require support systems that address their unique concerns. The 2010, Phase IV, initiative held a distinctive meeting that gathered 38 young people aged 17 to 25 together, in order to learn about recovery from their perspective. Each and every participant remarked upon the power of peer recovery support and how their recovery benefited from peer support. They also discussed the benefits of materials directed towards their age group. <br />Since youth and young adults benefit from materials tailored to their demographic, this projects seeks to utilize the materials from all previous iterations of Talking about Prescription Medicine Abuse: A National Multi-Media Outreach Campaign Addressing Prescription Medicine Misuse by Youth ages 12-17 and Young Adults ages 18-25 to develop and conduct a peer-led training program at educational institutions, such as colleges and universities and community colleges. The materials will be customizable, in order for educational institutions to adapt them as needed for their own training and educational programs. <br />The initiative will use the expertise of past Project Advisory Team members and request the participation of new, appropriate members, in order to guide and assist with development of the training program. The PAT must include young adults who participated in the Young People's Networking Dialogue on Recovery (YPNDR), held December 13, 2010. Appropriate members of the PAT will serve as ambassadors to assist with implementing the peer- led training programs. In order to maximize outreach efforts, the contractor will partner with Faces and Voices of Recovery to train youth on the materials and programs developed in this contract and to produce vignettes highlighting at least five young people to use in the educational outreach. <br />Youth and young adults need educational outreach and peer-led training to address the growing substance use epidemic. Youth illicit drug use increased significantly from previous years. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), among youths aged 12 to 17, the current illicit drug use rate increased from 2008 (9.3 percent) to 2009 (10.0 percent). <br />This is the first increase since 2002. <br />As we know from the previous outreach initiatives and current SAMHSA data, most individuals who take prescription medications take them responsibly; however, the non-medical use or abuse of prescription drugs remains a serious public health concern, especially with youth and young adults. The SAMHSA NSDUH 2009 report highlights several alarming statistics regarding youth and young adults, especially regarding prescription drugs non-medically. The non-medical use of prescription-type psychotherapeutics ranked as the second most abused drug in youth, behind marijuana. In 2009, of the 21.2 percent of young adults aged 18 to 25 who were current illicit drug users, 6.3 percent used prescription drugs non-medically. In 2009, of the 10.0 percent of young adults aged 12 to 17 who were current illicit drug users, 3.1 percent used prescription drugs non-medically. Therefore, youth and young adults abuse prescription drugs more than any other illicit drug, except marijuana. Although, among youths aged 12 to 17 in 2009, the rate of non-medical use of prescription drugs held steady at 3.1 percent- a non-significant increase from the 2008 NSDUH survey results of 2.9 percent, from 2002 to 2009, there was an increase among young adults aged 18-25 in the rate of current non-medical use of prescription-type drugs (from 5.5 to 6.3 percent), driven primarily by an increase in pain reliever misuse (from 4.1-4.8 percent). <br />Past year non-medical users of prescription-type psychotherapeutic drugs are asked how they obtained the drugs they recently used non-medically. Rates averaged for 2008 and 2009 show that over half of the non-medical users of prescription-type pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives aged 12 or older got the prescription drugs they used most recently "from a friend or relative for free." In a follow-up question, the majority of these respondents indicated that their friend or relative had obtained the drugs from one doctor.</p>
<p>Findings from the 2009 NSDUH indicate that among persons aged 12 or older in 2008-2009 who used pain relievers non-medically in the past 12 months, 55.3 percent got the pain relievers they most recently used from a friend or relative for free. Another 9.9 percent bought them from a friend or relative, and 5.0 percent took them from a friend or relative without asking. More than one in six (17.6 percent) indicated that they got the drugs they most recently used through a prescription from one doctor. About 1 in 20 users (4.8 percent) got pain relievers from a drug dealer or other stranger, and 0.4 percent bought them on the Internet. These percentages are similar to those reported in 2006-2007.<br />Youth and young adults abuse prescription medicines because they can easily access them-through the home, friends, and the Internet; are inexpensive; have less stigma for use than other drugs, such as heroin or cocaine; and are generally seen as safer than "street drugs." In fact, prescription drug abuse among students in U.S. colleges and universities has been rising for several years. Studies reveal up to 25 percent of students report the abuse of prescription stimulants on some campuses (McCabe et al, 2005). Students report non-medical uses of prescription medicines not only to "get high," but also to help with concentration when cramming for papers or tests, to self-medicate for anxiety or depression, and even to enhance their stamina when playing sports.</p>
<p>Prescription drugs are falsely viewed as a "safer" alternative to illicit substances because they are prescribed by a medical professional. They do not realize that prescription medications are safe and effective only when used under the supervision of a doctor, and only when used by the individual for which they were prescribed. Unfortunately, this trend is also connected with other high risk, unhealthy behaviors.</p>
<p>According to the NSDUH, among persons aged 18 to 22 years old, the rate of current use of illicit drugs in 2009 among full-time college students (22.7 percent) was similar to the rate among other persons in that age group (22.3 percent), which includes part-time college students, students in other grades or types of institutions, and nonstudents. The rate of current use of illicit drugs overall among 18 to 22 year olds who were in college full time increased from 20.2 percent in 2008 to 22.7 percent in 2009, but there was no significant change in the rate of drug use among those not enrolled full time in college.<br />The NSDUH also finds that among full-time college students aged 18 to 22, there were increases from 2008 to 2009 in the current nonmedical use of psychotherapeutic drugs overall (from 5.2 to 6.3 percent) and OxyContin&reg; (from 0.2 to 0.6 percent). There were no significant changes in the rates of current use for any drugs among persons aged 18 to 22 who were not full-time college students. These statistics speak to the importance of providing educational outreach to college-aged individuals about prescription medications and the consequences of illicit drug use. <br />NSDUH also provides statistics on the number of youth who need and who receive treatment. Among youth ages 12 to 17, there were 1.1 million (4.5 percent) who needed treatment for an illicit drug problem in 2009. Of this group, only 115,000 received treatment at a specialty facility (10.5 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 who needed treatment), leaving 983,000 youths who needed treatment but did not receive it at a specialty facility. <br />Also according to the 2009 NSDUH survey, almost 77 percent of youths reported having seen or heard drug or alcohol prevention messages from sources outside the school, lower than the 2002 percentage of 83.2. The percentage of school-enrolled youths reporting that they had seen or heard prevention messages also declined during this period from 78.8 to 74.9 percent. This initiative will help to address this deficit by creating peer-led informational programs and materials for use in schools, which overwhelmingly assisted the participants in the YPNDR<br />This proposed initiative will also reinforce outcomes presented at the Young People's Networking Dialogue on Recovery (YPNDR) by providing training and inspiration for peer-led programs and outreach. This project will build upon the findings presented in a White Paper that will guide future youth and prescription abuse initiatives. The training and materials developed through this project will enhance the young adult PAT members and YPNDR participants' recovery-based leadership role as peer leaders and ambassadors, which allow them to actively reach youth and young adults, aged 12-25 about the dangers of abusing prescription medications and help those in need of recovery services.<br />This initiative will build on our past collaborative efforts between SAMHSA and the National Council on Patient Information and Education (NCPIE) to reach youth, their parents and other youth influencers about the dangers of prescription misuse. Work on this project will also involve Faces and Voices of Recovery and the Food and Drug Administration through an Interagency Agreement. Also, this purchase order will continue the work from 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 to reach youth and young adults, their parents, and other youth influencers about the dangers of prescription misuse and the importance of treatment and recovery from substance use and mental health conditions. <br />Specific Tasks and Requirements:</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8,  548 Medical Center West Palm Beach


2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Siemens Med Lab Supply is the only vendor able to repair and bring to manufacturers specifications this Siemens Biograph6 PET/CT because of the proprietary software it runs.  This is a patient care issue.  Currently there is a backlog of patients for cancer screening on this machine.  This is an urgent matter as patients will have to be sent out for an extremely expensive procedure.  Med Lab Supply is the official representative for Siemens Medical in South Florida and the only vendor able to bring this room to manufacturer specifications. Estimated Cost is $100,770.00.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  One x-ray tube and calibration to manufacturer's specifications for the Siemens PET/CT mobile unit EE#34555.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	( )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(x)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 unusual and compelling urgency, currently WPB only has one PET/CT and it is used for cancer diagnosis, this system is completely off-line resulting in a patient backlog.  Prolonging the downtime of this machine is greatly affecting patient care.  Current backlog is 3 weeks' worth of scheduled patients at 6 patients a day totaling (90 Patients).  Current market estimate for fee basing a patient for a PET/CT scan is around $3000 per patient scan.  The resulting cost would be at least 60x$3000=$270,000. Delay in award would result in serious financial injury to the Government. Offers were not requested from potential sources as is practical as there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Siemens Med Lab Supply is the OEM of this equipment.  The component to be replaced is a part of a larger system that utilizes proprietary software to calibrate.  Med Lab Supply is the official representative for Siemens Medical in South Florida; which guarantees compatible parts, and ensures the warranty stays valid and compliant with FDA approval.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Siemens Med Lab Supply is the OEM of this equipment, component to be replaced is a part of a larger system that utilizes proprietary software to calibrate.  No other sources are available at this time.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  This amount was determined to be fair and reasonable based on a comparison to a prior order of similar and like items which were considered to be fair and reasonable by another Contracting Officer:  Order was awarded in July 2009 this item was previously on schedule through NAC. Prices were also compared to an order of similar and like items that was purchased on October 2010. Further price reasonableness was determined by using search engine medical equipment market value calculator which found the Siemens PET/CT tube average cost at $99,000.00.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted Searched for other authorized (Siemens) vendors for this repair.  None found.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Manufacturer's specifications are needed, proprietary software calibration is mandatory and no other vendor is authorized by Siemens.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None Found

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Will continue to look for a vendor who can repair these camera to manufacturers specifications.

Best Value Evaluation. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made based on a Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) approach. <br />(a) Technical Acceptability: The Government will first evaluate the Technical Acceptability of all timely quotes. Vendors shall quote on all line items in the Bid Schedule. Any response/quotation that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates line item will be provided at no charge will be rejected as Technically Unacceptable. A vendor's quote/response will be determined technically acceptable if it meets the requirements of this paragraph and the following factor is determined Technically Acceptable. Any quote that fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph or is rated technically unacceptable in the factor below will be technically unacceptable overall and will be ineligible for award.<br />(i) Factor 1: Technical Evaluation. In order to be determined Technically Acceptable for this factor, vendors must provide a quote on line items. Item quotes must list the manufacturer and part number and must be accompanied by literature and/or a brochure including photographs and/or drawings. The descriptive literature must demonstrate how the proposed meets the characteristics listed in the PWS. <br />(b) Evaluation: Next, the Government will conduct a price evaluation of all Technically Acceptable quotes. The price evaluation will consist of a comparison of all Technically Acceptable quotes submitted with each other. Prices will be ranked by total evaluated price. <br />5. Best Value Determination. The lowest priced technically acceptable quote/response will be determined to represent the Best Value. Award will be made to the vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among all technically acceptable quotes.<br />6. "Descriptive Literature" FAR 52.214-21, applies to this RFQ. Descriptive literature is required with any submission. Failure to provide descriptive literature will be cause for rejection of your quote. Additionally, if the descriptive literature fails to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the quote.<br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. Addendum: The following paragraph is tailored as follows: Para (c), Period for Acceptance of Quotes.

<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate is soliciting white papers for the following research effort: Advanced Weapon/Platform Integration (AWPI). It is anticipated one of the white papers may be selected for further consideration, and its originators may subsequently be requested to submit a formal written technical and cost proposal, with the intent of negotiating one Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for the AWPI program. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>(1) Statement of Objective/Needs: A higher level of weapon/platform interoperability is required to support future weapons systems to the Warfighter faster for less cost. The main objective of the AWPI effort is to investigate requirements and demonstrate future advanced weapon/platform interoperability technologies and system architectures. The proposed framework should consider advanced plug-and-play techniques along with new technologies to support anticipated future weapon integration requirements for legacy and future manned and unmanned combat aircraft and aero vehicles. The AWPI effort is expected to be divided into four tasks starting with future requirements/framework definition in Task 1, technical architecture development in Task 2, detailed technology development and prototyping in Task 3, and culminating with a system demonstration in Task 4. Additional in-scope tasks may be identified during this effort.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the AWPI effort, a successful offeror would:</p>
<p>a. (TO 0001) Investigate future requirements and define a comprehensive advanced weapon/platform integration approach as well as key constituent technologies needed for realization of an optimal framework. Key areas of consideration for supporting future requirements include high speed data transfer and networking, advanced electrical/optical physical interconnection approaches, future weapon carriage architectures, advanced weapon control/interface software implementation approaches, open architecture principles, and potential use of model-based virtual integration/test technologies to improve the weapon/platform integration process from cost, schedule, and technical perspectives.<br /><br />b. (TO 0002) A Technical Architecture (TA) for a next generation weapon integration framework shall be developed based on the findings of Task 1. The defined TA shall characterize a generalized, adaptable, and scalable system framework for flexibly integrating future U.S. and allied nation weapons with platforms in a cost effective and interoperable manner. The characterized framework shall be based to the extent feasible on open architecture and plug-and-play principles. Major system functional domains and key interfaces shall be identified within the generalized framework. Existing, emerging, and required technologies and standards required for successful implementation of systems which meet the objectives of the TA shall be documented in a Technology Roadmap. Applicable DOD Architecture Framework (DODAF) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) documentation products should be reviewed and/or used in specifying the TA, as deemed applicable. Flexibility for support of various weapon platform applications such as manned fighters and bombers, and unmanned aircraft shall be inherent within the documented TA. Technology developments (as well as any associated standards) or maturation required for optimally realizing practical systems which conform to the TA shall be identified. Technical activities necessary to develop/mature these technologies to a level sufficient for implementation in operational systems shall be defined at a top level and the envisioned cost/scope of these activities shall be characterized. Trade-offs shall be conducted to select one or more priority technologies for development and demonstration under subsequent tasks, in accordance with resource availability. These trade-offs shall be conducted in close consultation with the sponsor to ensure government priorities are best addressed within the available resource limits.</p>
<p>c. (TO 0003) Detailed development efforts shall be defined and carried out for the technology or technologies selected under Task 2 for priority development. This shall include technical investigations, designs, and laboratory prototyping/testing as applicable. Coordination with relevant industry/government working groups involved in associated technology advancement and/or standardization activities shall also be tracked and participated in, where applicable. Documentation of the developed technologies to support subsequent technology transition and implementation shall also be produced.</p>
<p>d. (TO 0004) The advanced weapon integration technology or technologies developed under Task 3 shall be demonstrated in a system context that is reflective of the weapon integration framework defined and consistent with the Technical Architecture documented under Task 2. This demonstration may be oriented toward a specific application of interest (e.g., control and networking of large numbers of next generation micro-munitions on unmanned platforms) that is coordinated with the sponsor. A system prototype highlighting the subject technology or technologies shall be designed, implemented, and demonstrated in a system integration laboratory (SIL) environment under this task. The performance of the highlighted technologies in realistic operational scenarios shall be thoroughly tested and documented as part of this demonstration. Support for transition of the subject technology to the acquisition community shall also be provided.</p>

Additionally, a risk assessment (See section/paragraph V(3)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the Best Value to the Government. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p>(1.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) in Factor (1) are of equal importance.<br />a. Soundness of offeror's proposed AWPI Concept, proposed development, and producibility approach.<br />b. Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to conducting the design.<br />c. Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to performing test, evaluation and assessment of the design.</p>
<p>(1.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br />a. Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule. <br />b. Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />c. Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Capabilities and experience may include unique combinations of these subfactors, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Any resumes should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the White Paper page limits. The Government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p>(1.3) Factor (3) Cost - Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the third order of priority.</p>
<p>(2) Proposal Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. Additionally, a risk assessment (See section/paragraph V(3)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the Best Value to the Government. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p>(2.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (d) in Factor (1) are of equal importance.<br />a. The offeror's understanding of the scope of the technical effort.<br />b. Soundness of the offeror's technical approach.<br />c. Soundness of the offeror's management approach.<br />d. Realistic and feasible Statement of Work that implements the technical and managerial approach.</p>
<p>(2.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br />a. Offeror's record of success on past accomplishments related to the topic.<br />b. Qualified key personnel, subcontractors to include small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), and subject matter experts.<br />c. Adequate facilities, equipment, and other enabling resources.<br /><br />Capabilities and experience may include unique combinations of these subfactors, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Any resumes should be in a separate Appendix. The Government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p>(2.3) Factor (3) Cost - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (3) are of equal importance.<br />a. Reasonableness for a technology development effort.<br />b. Realistic and appropriate budgeting, pricing, and costs.<br />c. Completeness of the offeror's cost proposal to encompass all anticipated costs.</p>
<p>(3) White Paper/Proposal Risk Assessment: White Paper/Proposal risk will be assessed at each Factor level as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. White Paper/Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. The following definitions will be used during the risk assessment:</p>
<p>(3.1) High: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.</p>
<p>(3.2) Moderate: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(3.3) Low: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(4) No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual White Paper/Proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other White Papers and Proposals submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>(5) Review and Selection Process: Should formal proposals be requested based on the evaluation of White Papers, those technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time, using the same criteria stated above, and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>a. Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>b. Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>c. Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>

<p>(1) Communication: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of White Papers. If a full proposal is requested, dialogue may continue between the offeror and Government representative until submission of the full proposal. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br />&nbsp;<br />(2) Debriefings: When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).<br />&nbsp;<br />(3) Wide Area Work Flow Notice: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests.

Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system.

Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.).

If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of the work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor.<br />&nbsp;<br />(8) On-Line Representations and Certifications: Potential offerors are notified that effective 01 Jan 2005 to be eligible for an award; they must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications, otherwise known as On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) via the Business Partner Network (BPN) at http://www.bpn.gov/orca .

AFRL/RW has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>

	The RAPIDGate Program enables electronic verification of identity and access privileges at Fort McCoys access control points (ACPs), thereby improving security and streamlining access to the installation.
Access Privilege Management
    Companies choosing to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will have streamlined access onto the installation. Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate. 
    Companies choosing not to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will be required to access the installation through the Main Gate, utilizing the commercial lane only. To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. drivers license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday  Friday 7:30a.m.  4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
    Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
    The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individuals employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
    Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>Sellers offering equivalent products shall submit supporting documentation for each equivalent product offered.

Authorized Workers Notice to Potential Bureau of Reclamation Contractors(a)	Definitions.  		IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
 	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
 	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
 	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
 	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
 	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of OR Gowns. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source (s) for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price for each MMESO AOR. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. </strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:
<p>1. MMESO North</p>
<p>2. MMESO South</p>
<p>3. MMESO West</p>
<p>4. MMESO Pacific</p>
<p>5. MMESO Europe</p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR) for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and/or Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is <strong>not </strong>a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at <a href="https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil">https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</a>.</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be conducted concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is <strong>July 2011</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each <strong>MMESO AOR:Point of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and 011-49-6221-172109.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of OR Gowns. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,454,747.62. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North $349,264.16, MMESO South $406,839.31, MMESO West $311,564.51, MMESO Europe $229,102.33, MMESO Pacific $159,071.14, and Non-MMESO purchases $1,098.87. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the forty-four (44) line items of the total seventy-nine (79) line items, account for 83% ($1,212,155.74) of the total volume in sales ($1,454,747.62) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top usage lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, robert.halliday@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by the Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by a Designated Senior Clinician (DSC) in the MMESOs AOR and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor (s) on initial submissions/quotes. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing</strong> <strong>for each MMESO AOR based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR . The MMESO Europe reserves the </strong>right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>

Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all line items (MMESO). Vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in Phase II will be disqualified.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Evaluations <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Europe, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Europe via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, and tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). <strong>Two (2) samples</strong> of each disposable operating room gown listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites that will be identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>1. Surgical gown (disposable &amp; sterile), Gown surgical disposable impervious, size XL - 2 per MTF/CPT member<br />2. Surgical gown (disposable &amp; sterile), Gown surgical disposable reinforced, size XL - 2 per MTF/CPT member</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the <strong>Clinically Preferred</strong> threshold of products for standardization.<br />A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. .</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The OR gown must have barrier protection and resist saturation and any penetration of liquids (fluid strike-throughs) in order to maintain sterility and protect the clinician during an operating procedure in accordance with the Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal (NPSG) 07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections. <br />a. The ORgown will be wet with water and inspected during and after the simulated surgical procedure process cycle for visual signs of moisture and/or wetness (fluid strike-throughs).<br />2. The OR gown must resist tears and/or perforations in order to maintain sterility and protect the clinician during an operating procedure in accordance with the Joint Commission NPSG 07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections. <br />a. The OR gown will be manipulated in a way that simulates events during a surgical procedure and inspected during and after the simulated surgical procedure process cycle for visual signs of tears or perforations.<br />3. The OR gown's construction must have limited memory, be flexible enough to conform loosely to the clinician's body, be lightweight, have breathability, and have a pleasant odor in accordance with AAMI PB70:2003 Product Performance Standards.<br />a. Each OR gown will be donned according to the manufacturer's guidelines and examined for comfort, breathability, weight, conformity to the clinician's body, and any unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis</p>
<p>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified and invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to the MMESO Europe by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.</strong> <br />1. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. <br />2. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement.<br />3. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO area of responsibility (AOR) based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. <br />4. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR<br />The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor (s) on initial submissions/quotes. Price will be analyzed based on the vendor's anticipated post-standardization costs. Post-standardization cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of each MMESO. Unmatched items will be represented in the post-standardization cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price aggregate post-standardization cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</strong></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is being issued in conjunction with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as applicable. The solicitation number is 11-223-SOL-00069. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>Funds are not presently available for this requirement. Award will be subject to if/when appropriated funds are available.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is soliciting for an instrument, with necessary components and consumables permitting immediate use, to simultaneously measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption and cytoplasic glycolysis in live cells to compare mitochondrial function with oxidative damage to proteins without lifting the cell or requiring trypsinization. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) program involves the study of protein biochemistry and the role of oxidative stress. Mitochondrial respiration is a major source of free radicals that maybe beneficial or detrimental to the quality and function of proteins. CDER regulates several protein products whose function is critically impacted by free radicals. CDER has indicated that the Seahorse Bioscience, Inc. XF Extracellular Flux Analyzers, available in 24-well format, together with XF Prep Station will meet their study needs, however, quotes will be accepted and evaluated from all interested parties. Quotes shall be priced FOB Destination (FDA/CDER, 29 Lincoln Dr, Building 29A, Bethesda, MD 20892) with inside delivery, setup and training for a minimum of two (2) Government operators; shall identify proposed delivery in calendar days after receipt of order; shall detail the consumables required to immediately operate the instrument to include identification and quantities of the consumables furnished with the instrument and FOB Destination pricing, good for one (1) year from date of award, for additional consumables necessary for continued operation; shall specify the commercial warranty period and nature of support provided during that warranty period; shall provide pricing (inclusive of travel, labor, and parts) and terms for four 1-year option periods of on-site maintenance and repair, regularly scheduled preventive maintenance inspections, hardware and software upgrades, and unlimited telephone and email support to technical and operational inquiries, which would begin after expiration of the warranty period; and shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered instrument and components meet the technical requirements identified above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The instrument system shall meet the following technical requirements which will serve as the basis for technical evaluation:</p>
<p>The instrument system must allow measurements of oxygen consumption in adherent cells. Lifting cells disrupts cell structure and ionic gradients, and hence metabolism; and lifting cells is not possible in the case of the differentiated (branched) myotubes.</p>
<p>Optional item- basic service agreement to include on-site, travel, labor and parts for repairs, one preventative maintenance visit per contract option year and software upgrades. Phone &amp; email response to service request.</p>

Option year 1-Basic service agreement (after initial 1 year warranty) to include on-site, travel, labor and parts for repairs, one preventative maintenance visit per contract option year and software upgrades. Phone &amp; email response to service request. <br />4. Option year 2-Basic service agreement to include on-site, travel, labor and parts for repairs, one preventative maintenance visit per contract option year and software upgrades. Phone &amp; email response to service request<br />5. Option year 3-Basic service agreement to include on-site, travel, labor and parts for repairs, one preventative maintenance visit per contract option year and software upgrades. Phone &amp; email response to service request</p>

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the items/services offered; and<br />(ii) Price.</p>
<p>In determining best value to the Government, technical capability is more important than price though price remains a significant factor and must be affordable.</p>
<p>The proposals will be analyzed to ensure the fulfillment of the minimum technical specifications as specified above. Proposals considered not to meet the minimum specifications may be excluded from further consideration. The specifications described above should be fulfilled, and all information requested should be provided in order to allow for an appropriate determination of best value</p>

<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the product and/or service meets the technical requirements. Offerors shall specifically address the specifications stated above as well as technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror. As technical capability of the instrument becomes essentially equal price may become the ultimate determining factor. Include the firms DUNS number with quote and indicate that ORCA information is current, accurate and complete to this solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. Because of the unique features and items of each vendor's instrument accessory items may be added to the successful offerors initial proposal.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND SUMMARY</p>
<p>Created in December 1986 and operating under the Ministry of Environment since February 1997, the National Energy Conservation Centre (ENERCON) is responsible for energy conservation and energy efficiency for all sectors of the economy. ENERCON promotes energy conservation that includes identifying appropriate energy conservation opportunities, undertaking pilot projects, training and education efforts, and developing plans and policies that promote energy efficiency. ENERCON serves as the secretariat for the Pakistan Energy Conservation Council and maintains the Energy Conservation Fund, which was established to provide financial assistance to energy conservation activities.</p>
<p>USTDA is funding a feasibility study, on behalf of ENERCON, to demonstrate LPG's viability as a fuel for buses which may be considered for seven major municipalities in Pakistan. This study will: examine the worldwide market for LPG and its applicability to Pakistan; assess the operational requirements to convert the bus fleets to LPG; analyze the economic and financial aspects behind an LPG transition; assess the technical and legal/regulatory requirements that will enable LPG to be used as a fuel for buses; prepare an implementation plan; and examine potential partnerships with U.S. companies for equipment and services.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $482,118 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<p>Description of Requirement: The Air Force requires a Firm Fixed Price, Contract for the Auto Crib automated inventory equipment which provides a means of supplying and measuring common use items used throughout the 76 MXW. 76 MXSS is in the process of installing automated point of use Equipment (POU) throughout 76 MXW.

AutoCrib is the brand found that is able to accommodate all the needs of the 76 MXW within one company. This is not a sole source request. The requirement will be competed among the approved small business dealers for Auto Crib items.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Sub factors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delivery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or sub line items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

<p>5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005)<br />(IAW AFFARS 5301.9103)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, OC-ALC/PKC at 405 736 -3273, FAX 000 000-0000, email .

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft.

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award two (2) contracts, one (1) contract from the 8(a) set aside and one (1) Small Business set aside.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Assured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Request for Information<br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406 <br />
<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding an end-to-end Ka- and Ku- commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) capability for Department of Defense theater specific operations.&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong>COMSATCOM is an essential communications component for in-theater operations.&nbsp; The USCENTCOM theater of operations incurs the greatest amount of COMSATCOM usage, using Ku-band service on more than 20 different commercial communications satellites, mostly through the use of base period leases (typically single-year) with additional option year leases.&nbsp; Leases range from small fractions of a Transponded Equivalent (TPE) to multiple TPEs with an aggregate sustained demand of over 5 GHz of service and more than 1,200 terminal links/accesses.</p>
<p>With the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 President's Budget Request, the DoD is preparing for an FY12-FY14 investment to acquire long-term satellite communications services in the Ka- and Ku-bands, preferably on a single satellite, to meet COCOM theater demand, directing as many future users and migrating as many existing users as possible from Ku to Ka-band.&nbsp; (Per Appendix A, Ground Tactical demand is envisioned migrating to Ka-band whereas AISR Demand will remain at Ku-band.)&nbsp; The investment includes both the space segment and associated terminals.&nbsp; Initially, the DoD goal is to reduce costs for COMSATCOM capability in the CENTCOM theater of operations.&nbsp; In the future, DoD requires the flexibility of moving these services to other theaters of operation as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates? Describe the functions and staffing of any NOC used for operations of comparable commercial systems.<br /><strong>T12.</strong>What are the information assurance features or characteristics of your service (e.g., TT&amp;C link encryption, network controls)? How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation. From what other contracts or sources can these terminals be procured?<br /><br /><strong>Schedule<br />S1.</strong>The desired date from service activation is 31 December 2014; describe your plan to meet this schedule. What is the necessary contract award date to accomplish this? Ensure service test and checkout prior to Government acceptance of the service is included in your schedule.<br /><strong>S2.</strong>Describe the timeline for terminal and user equipment contract award to delivery and installation of equipment.</p>

<DESC>Description of Action:   The proposed sole source action is for a one-year firm-fixed price (FFP) contract with PSI International Inc. (PSI) for technical support for Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) applications that support mission critical enterprise systems.

Description of Supplies or Services:  LGY is a program that provides for the federal backing of mortgage loans to eligible Veterans, Active Duty personnel, Reservists, National Guard members, and some surviving spouses that they use to apply for and purchase homes. This program has multiple web-based systems which allow Veterans data to be processed.  These systems include, but are not limited to, WebLGY (WLGY) Framework and associated applications, Loan processing and eligibility systems, Legacy Appraisal System (The Appraisal System - TAS ), Special Adapted Housing/Special Housing Adaptation (SAHSHA), FileNet Applications, Centralized Property Management System (CPTS), Veterans Information Portal (VIP)/LGY Portal and Electronic Lender Information (WebELI). PSI, as the Incumbent, has already developed and implemented applications which support and maintain these systems. The purpose of this task is to allow PSI to provide the necessary technical support activities for all LGY critical systems including internal and external system interfaces, and application enhancements.  This will allow continued maintenance and emergent upgrades to applications such that unanticipated system bugs and limitations are addressed.  Failure to provide this support will severely impact the LGY mission in assisting veterans and active duty personnel in the purchase or retention of homes pursuant to the GI Bill. The total estimated price of the proposed action is $2.5M. 

Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting logical follow-on as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.405-6(b)(2)
