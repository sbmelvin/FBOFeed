<DESC>THE UNITED STATES ARMY TACOM LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT COMMAND (LCMC) IN WARREN, MICHIGAN INTENDS TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS FOR A FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT ACTION/MODIFICATION TO EXISTING CONTRACT NUMBER W56HZV-07-C-0378 WITH PARAMETRIC TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (PTC) FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY ALREADY DEVELOPED UNDER THE BASIC CONTRACT, HEREIN DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:  DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PILOT APPLICATIONS  OF AN INTEGRATED REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SYSTEM (IRMSS) AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT WITH TARDEC'S EXISTING ADVANCED COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENTS SYSTEM.  THE OVERALL INTENT OF THIS IRMSS PROJECT EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICALITY OF MAINTAINING ASSOCIATION OF REQUIREMENTS (E.G., USER, SYSTEM, SUBSYSTEM, SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS) WITH PROGRAM, ACQUISITION, AND SUPPORT INFORMATION, SYSTEM ENGINEERING, DESIGN REVIEW DATA, RELATED PROGRAMS, AND TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS ! FOR END-TO-END TRACEABILITY.  THE WORK THUSFAR COMPLETED TO THIS POINT HAS UTILIZED A TRADEMARKED COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) WEB-BASED PROCESS AND CONTENT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE CALLED WINDCHILL IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILTY OF SUCH A SYSTEM AND ITS' APPLICABILITY TO THE CURRENT NEEDS OF THE ARMY TO SUPPORT GLOBALLY DISPERSED ADVANCED SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TEAMS.  THE CURRENT ONGOING EFFORT LAYS OUT FOUR PHASES IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THIS OBJECTIVE.  THE FIRST THREE INVOLVE DEFINING THE PROBLEM DETAILS, DETERMINING A SOLUTION, AND DEVELOPING THAT SOLUTION.  THE FOURTH INVOLVES ADAPTING AND DEPLOYING THE DEVELOPED SOLUTION TO A SET OF PILOT USER GROUPS IN ORDER TO VALIDATE ITS' ACCURACY AND APPLICABILITY TO THE NEEDS OF REAL WORLD USERS.  ONCE IN THE HANDS OF THESE USERS, THE SOLUTION IS REFINED AND IMPROVED THROUGH AN ITERATIVE APPROACH IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE SOLUTION SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF THE USERS AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH T! O SIMULTANEOUSLY RELATE TO THE MANY DIFFERENT USER GROUPS THAT AN ARMY SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS THROUGHOUT THE INTEGRATED DEFENSE ACQUISITION, TECHNOLOGY, AND LOGISTICS LIFE CYCLE.  UNDER THE INTIAL CONTRACT EFFORT, TWO PILOT GROUPS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING AREAS WHERE ADJUSTMENTS AND UPDATES TO THE SOLUTION WERE AND ARE STILL NEEDED.  THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL WORK EFFORT FOR THIS CONTRACT, IN THE ESTIMATED COST PLUS FIXED FEE AMOUNT OF $2,232,852, INCLUDES FURTHERANCE OF THE ONGOING WORK AND INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL WORK ASPECTS AS FOLLOWS:  1) TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL REFINEMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE CAPABILITIES ALREADY DEVELOPED FOR THE EXISTING TWO PILOT USER GROUPS; 2) TO ALLOW THE INCLUSION OF THREE NEW PILOT USER GROUPS (REPRESENTING ADDITIONAL AREAS OF THE INTEGRATED DEFENSE ACQUISITION, TECHNOLOGY, AND LOGISTICS LIFE CYCLE), TO INCLUDE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING CAPABILITIES AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADAPT ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES TO ADDRESS RELATED REQUIREMENTS/USE-CASES; AND 3) TO SUPPORT THE UPGRADE OF THE SOFTWARE TEST BED TO A MORE REC! ENT OUT-OF-THE-BOX SOFTWARE VERSION THAT HAS INCORPORATED CAPABILITIES DEVELOPED THROUGH THESE EFFORTS.  THE CURRENT PILOT USER GROUPS ARE FOCUSED ON SUSTAINMENT SUPPORT AND PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT, AND THE NEED FOR THE EXPANSION TO THE THREE ADDITIONAL PILOT GROUPS STEMS FROM THE NEED TO CAPTURE AND RELATE ADDITIONAL REAL WORLD INFORMATION FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE LIFE CYCLE; MORE SPECIFICALLY, PILOT GROUPS IN THE PRODUCTION/FIELDING, REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT, AND RD&E SUPPORT HAVE ALL BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY AREAS OF ADDITIONAL FOCUS.  LASTLY, THIS PROPOSED NEW EFFORT WILL SUPPORT THE UPGRADE IN SOFTWARE VERSION, ALLOWING BOTH THE ACE TEAM AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM'S 3,000-PLUS USERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE OUT-OF-THE-BOX SOFTWARE.  THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS PROPOSED NEW EFFORT IS PROJECTED TO BE 15 MONTHS IN DURATION.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE RFP FOR THIS PROPOSED ADDITIONAL EFFORT ACTION WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OR ABOUT 31 AUGUST 2008, WITH ! THE PROPOSAL DUE 30 DAYS THEREAFTER, OR APPROXIMATELY 30 SEPTEMBER 2008.  SOURCES OTHER THAN PTC WITH POTENTIAL INTEREST IN THIS EFFORT SHALL CONTACT MICHAEL CIACIUCH, AMSTA-AQ-ASGA CONTRACT SPECIALIST, AT EITHER E-MAIL MICHAEL.CIACIUCH@US.ARMY.MIL OR PHONE 586.753.2324.

<DESC>THE UNITED STATES ARMY TACOM LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT COMMAND (LCMC) IN WARREN, MICHIGAN INTENDS TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS FOR A FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT ACTION/MODIFICATION TO EXISTING CONTRACT NUMBER DAAE07-03-C-L107 WITH PATRICK POWER PRODUCTS, INC. FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY ALREADY DEVELOPED UNDER THE BASIC CONTRACT, HEREIN DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:  USING AN EXISTING DESIGN AS A STARTING BASELINE, FURTHER DESIGN (INCLUDING RUGGEDIZATION/MILITARIZATION), DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THREE GENERATIONS (INCLUDING EVALUATING SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS AND APPLYING THEM AS APPROPRIATE), TESTING AND EVALUATION, REPORTING, DEMONSTRATION, AND DELIVERY OF A ROTARY MULTI-FUEL (DIESEL AND JP-8) AUXILIARY POWER UNIT (RMF-APU) ADAPTED FOR BOTH THE ABRAMS MAIN BATTLE TANK AND STRYKER MILITARY VEHICLES, MAXIMIZING THE COMMONALITY BETWEEN THEIR DESIGNS.  THE APU'S ENGINE, ALTERNATOR, RADIATOR, MUFFLER AND AIR FILTER WERE ALL REQUIRED TO BE DESIGNED TO FIT WI! THIN THE RESPECTIVE VEHICLE'S UNDER-ARMORED APU SPACE CLAIMS, AND ADDITIONAL AREAS OF EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT INCLUDED AIR INDUCTION, FUEL INJECTION, COMBUSTION PRE-CHAMBER, ALTERNATOR (INCLUDING ALTERNATOR COOLING), ENGINE SYSTEM COOLING AND EXHAUST, ENGINE LUBRICATION SYSTEM, INTERCOOLER, NOISE ATTENUATION/REDUCTION, RUGGEDIZATION OF THE AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM, SOFTWARE CONTROLS, AND HIGH TEMPERATURE & ELECTRICAL INTEGRATION QUALIFICATION.  AFTER DEMONSTRATION, THE APU'S ENGINE WAS TORN DOWN FOR INSPECTION, DOCUMENTED FOR ANY ACCELERATED WEAR, AND REASSEMBLED FOR DELIVERY TO THE GOVERNMENT.  THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL NEW WORK EFFORT FOR THIS CONTRACT, IN THE ESTIMATED COST PLUS FIXED FEE AMOUNT OF $1,670,000, INCLUDES FURTHER EFFORTS TO MEET THE USER REQUIREMENT OF 12 HOURS - WITH 24 DESIRED - OF ELECTRICAL POWER FOR MISSION ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS NOT MOVING, WHICH EXCEEDS THE VEHICLE'S STANDARD BATTERY SET'S CAPABILITY, THUS REQUIRING CREWS TO OPERATE TH! E VEHICLE'S MAIN ENGINE FOR POWER, WHICH IS NOISY AND USES FAR MORE FUEL THAN THE APU DEVELOPED UP TO THIS POINT DOES.  ANOTHER FACET OF THIS ADDITIONAL EFFORT IS INCREASING THE POWER DENSITY OF THE DELIVERED THIRD GENERATION APU IN AN EFFORT TO MEET ANTICIPATED FUTURE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM GROWTH.  IT WILL ALSO CONTINUE THE COMMONALITY THRUST DIRECTED FOR A COMMON APU FOR BOTH THE ABRAMS AND STRYKER (AS WELL AS THE BRADLEY) VEHICLES.  THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE APU COMPONENTS RELATED TO POWER, EFFICIENCY, EMISSIONS, RELIABILITY, AND MAINTAINABILITY.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE ENGINE, PUMP(S), INJECTOR(S), INDUCTION/EXHAUST SYSTEMS, AND CONTROLLING HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ARE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS ADDITIONAL EFFORT.  FURTHERMORE, A REVIEW AND REDESIGN (WHERE APPROPRIATE) OF THE ANCILLARY SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS WILL MAXIMIZE COMPONENT LAYOUT AND INTEGRATION EFFECTIVENESS FOR INCREASED POWER AND EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPLETE APU.  AT EVERY LEVEL, AN UNDERLYING CONSIDERATION WILL BE TO MAINTAIN AND, WHEREVER POSSIBL! E, IMPROVE SYSTEM/COMPONENT COMMONALITY FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT ACROSS A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AND VEHICLE PLATFORMS.  THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS PROPOSED NEW EFFORT IS EXPECTED TO BE FROM 12-18 MONTHS IN DURATION.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE RFP FOR THIS PROPOSED ADDITIONAL EFFORT ACTION WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OR ABOUT 31 AUGUST 2008, WITH THE PROPOSAL DUE 30 DAYS THEREAFTER, OR APPROXIMATELY 30 SEPTEMBER 2008.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT - Brand Name Justification for NetIQ Enterprise License Agreement and Maintenance

The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a contract for commercial items.  We will be negotiating an award on a sole source basis to NetIQ Corporation for their proprietary software against their Federal Supply Schedule.  This purchase order will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 11.105 and FAR Part 52.211-6 - Brand Name or Equal.  The purchase order will include software licenses and maintenance for IRS's security compliance posture monitoring and reporting solution.  The IRS is divided into three commissioner-level organizations, with its main functions in four operating divisions: Large & Mid-Size Business (LMSB), Small Business / Self-Employed (SB/SE), Wage and Investment (W&I), and Tax Exempt & Government Entities (TE/GE).  The IRS also provides support for MITS TIGTA; Criminal Investigation (CI); Chief Counsel; SOI; and Appeals. The IRS currently has approximately 5,000 servers, 120,000 desktops/laptops, several mainframes and numerous routers/switches.  The NetIQ solution will be used to check and report out on the IT security compliance posture of these key pieces of IRS's infrastructure.  The solution will be applied to all IRS servers, laptop and desktop computers connected to the IRS network as well as standalone.  

IRS Security Operations stakeholder organizations formed an Integrated Project Team (IPT) and defined a set of 7 capabilities that are required to meet the IRS’ unique FISMA and IT Security objectives of “Ability to assess, monitor, and report effectiveness of its implemented technical security controls in accordance to policies and standards mandated by OMB and NIST.  During the month of May 2008, a Proof-of-Concept was conducted by the IRS security operations stakeholder organizations (i.e., MITS AD, ES, EOPS, EUES, Cybersecurity, and Chief Counsel).  IRS invited the top vendors (i.e., those who demonstrated the ability to meet IRS’s business and technical requirements) to participate.  The top three vendors accepted the invitation – NetIQ, nCircle, and Secure Elements.  The products were evaluated against IRS’ business and technical requirements and the results clearly identified the NetIQ solution as being the only solution that met and exceeded all of IRS’ requirements.  Following are the 7 functional and operational capabilities each product was evaluated against:

The NetIQ solution is the only solution which meets or exceeds IRS's complex security compliance posture monitoring and reporting requirements.  This includes the capability to assess, monitor, and report the effectiveness of IRS's implemented technical security controls in accordance to policies and standards mandated by OMB and NIST.  Therefore, the product must be validated by NIST Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) program (http://nvd.nist.gov/scapproducts.cfm) and meet polices mandated by OMB M-07-11 Implementation of Commonly Accepted Security Configurations for Windows Operating Systems, OMB M-7-18 Ensuring New Acquisitions Include Common Security Configurations, and Treasury Memo: Enhanced Cyber Security Controls, dated December 20, 2007.  The NetIQ solution complies with these policies and standards.

The NetIQ solution is a proprietary software product owned and developed by the company.  NetIQ does not allow any other company to sell or maintain its product.  

The delivery order will be fulfilled by one GSA FSS schedule contractor.  Solicitation Number is TBD.  Award will be made on or before September 30, 2008.  Questions can be e-mailed to Tonya.H. Yeldell@irs.gov.

Offeror must quote cost of total requirement by breaking out labor cost which is part of the total cost.</p>
<p>FOB is Travis Air Force Base. The following provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition. Offerors must comply with all instruction contained in FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offers-Commercial. FAR 52.212-2-Evaluation-Items paragraph (a) to this provision is completed as follows: EVALUATION CRITERIA: The Government will award the contract resulting form the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirement will be the most advantageous to the Government, past performance and price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. PAST PERFORMANCE 2. PRICE Past Performance is significantly more important than price when being evaluated. Provide up to three (3) sources (list Government source/s if available) as a reference of the most recent and *relevant past and present contracts performed within the last three (3) years. The Government will contact those sources provided by the offeror with a past performance survey.</p>
<p>(1) Furnish the following information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Company/division name<br />b. Product/service<br />c. Contracting agency<br />d. Contract number<br />e. Contract dollar value<br />f. Period of Performance<br />g. Name, address, email address, FAX number, and telephone number of the Contracting Officer and Functional Area Chief.<br />h. Comments regarding compliance with the contract terms and conditions.<br />i. Comments regarding any known performance deemed not acceptable to the customer or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance Survey: The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirement. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror's sources to assess past and present performance.<br /><br />*Relevancy definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Very Relevant Present/past performance efforts involving the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially the same as this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance efforts involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, than this solicitation requires.<br />Semi-Relevant Present/past performance contractual efforts involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, than this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Did not involve any significant aspects of above<br /><br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each, if applicable.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving the requirement that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "High Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the requirement, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little Confidence, or No Confidence, as defined in AFFARS MP5315.3, Table 3. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in the requirement.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Team Assessment – Washington Services Branch


 (1) PURPOSE:  Improve team communication, cooperation, and self-awareness among the staff of the Washington Services Branch (including the manager), and find ways to reduce or eliminate the divisiveness of the situation.

(2) SCOPE OR MISSION:  Conduct an assessment of the overall climate and areas of team conflict and/or dysfunction in the Washington Services Branch by conducting one-on-one interviews with all staff members as well as with the branch manager.  Help the manager find more effective ways of resolving the conflicts within the organization.

Once an initial evaluation is conducted, possible interventions which may be considered include:  (1) Conduct some type of teambuilding or team conflict intervention to get the issues out on the table for resolution, and facilitate group discussions of the problems to get at viable solutions;  (2) Conduct some type of independent competency assessment to provide developmental feedback to staff members and to measure progress toward developing more advanced skills; (3) Provide coaching to the branch’s manager on more effective was to approach the skills gap problem; (4) Recommend other interventions which become apparent during the assessment phase of this project.

(3) PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Initial evaluation to be conducted August – September, 2008 at OPM’s Washington, DC headquarters, located at 1900 E St. NW.  Intervention must begin prior to September 3, 2008.  Subsequent interventions to address the issues discovered may extend into quarter 1 of FY 2009.  Separate pricing for each phase is requested.

(4) BACKGROUND:  Some degree of dysfunction and conflict has developed within the Washington Services Branch, and there is dissatisfaction among some staff members with the current manager.  This is perceived by the manager as being based on the fact that employees tend to be categorized and given work assignments based on skill sets.  One group of employees works mostly, if not exclusively, on traditional examining tasks which include case examining, accomplishment record ratings, and to a very limited extent, training on the use of the automated USA Staffing system.  Most of this work is done in the office and entails the use of USA Staffing.  Examining consultants usually interact with clients only by telephone.

The second group of employees, who also do the above mentioned examining task, have a broader skill set and are frequently used on large scale consulting projects which include performance management, organization development, workforce and succession planning, recruiting and training, development of assessment methodologies, position classification, work process analysis, etc.  These projects may entail travel and frequently require extensive face-to-face interaction with relatively high-level clients.

The first group is resentful of the second group, and while many in the first group have had multiple opportunities to work on consulting projects, their success on those projects has not been encouraging.  As a consequence, the manager has tended to limit many of their assignments to examining, or to support roles on consulting projects, and the resentment has grown.  Because there are some racial differences between the two groups, this too has developed as an issue.

(5) PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES, GOALS AND OUTCOMES:  

•	Assess the current climate in Washington Services Branch and provide a written report of findings
•	Identify underlying factors contributing to any issues identified
•	Recommend interventions designed to improve employee morale and performance
•	Conduct interventions, as agreed upon by CTS leadership 


Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to OPM’s Washington Services Branch (WSB).  Best value is defined as the outcome that provides the optimal combination of elements such as lowest total cost, quality, creativity and professionalism in the proposed plan.  In making the comparison, WSB is interested in obtaining a superior technical approach.  The factors to be used in determining which proposal is most advantageous to WSB are listed below.  These factors taken together are more important than are cost/price considerations.  Qualification and selection will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to conduct the required organizational assessment and implement the appropriate interventions for building a better WSB team.   


1.)	Technical Approach

a.)	Provide a brief description of your plan to address the requirements spelled out in this request for proposal.

	b.)	Provide a brief summary of projects with which your company has experience that involved organizational assessment and implementing interventions for improving morale and performance.       


2.)	Past Performance / Experience


a.)	Provide at least two client references, including contact information and a brief statement of the nature of the project provided the client.    


3.)	Key Personnel

a.)	Provide a resume for key personnel who are envisioned to be working on this project.

This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is “information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.” (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf).

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk – regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM’s IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the June 12, 2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-26.  This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 493190.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and no additional written solicitation will be issued.  

The National Library of Medicine has a requirement for the following services: (1) to provide, exclusively for NLM’s use, a secure, clean, regularly monitored and well-maintained underground storage environment for acetate-based reels of motion picture film, many of which are unique and not available from any other U.S. medical library, as well as unspecified boxed quantities of cans of newly-acquired films pending transfer to NLM for cataloging; (2) to provide, exclusively for NLM’s use, a secure, clean, regularly monitored and well-maintained underground storage environment for 35mm silver-gelatin camera master acetate- and polyester-based microfilm reels, many of which are unique and irreplaceable; (3) to accommodate magnetic tapes, including boxed unspecified quantities of newly acquired tapes pending transfer to NLM for cataloging, and additional material (e.g. historic medical photographic prints) as required by NLM; (4) to provide disaster mitigation, preparedness and response protection for the vaults, anteroom and NLM’s stored materials; (5) to arrange for annual independent party air quality sampling in the vaults and anteroom; (6) to conduct a routine program of safety inspections and equipment maintenance and repair for the electrical, fire alarm and HVAC systems connected to the vaults and anteroom; (7) to provide on-site security for NLM’s vaults and stored materials; (8) to provide adequate and appropriate shelving and furnishings for the storage and access of NLM materials; (9) to provide round trip courier service with 48-hour turnaround time for the pickup and delivery of NLM materials being shipped to or from the vaults; (10) to observe all NLM stipulations regarding conditioning of film materials prior to placement in, or subsequent to removal from the motion picture vault; (11) to maintain detailed, accurate inventories of stored NLM materials; (12) to maintain digital environmental monitoring devices in the vaults and provide the Library with electronic reports on a regular basis; (13) to provide the Library with periodic reports concerning ongoing vault performance and detailing reasons for out-of-spec temperature or relative humidity conditions, including steps taken to replace or repair worn-out or malfunctioning equipment. 
 
In addition to being provided with stable low temperature and relative humidity, the vaults shall be maintained with a slightly positive air pressure and a specified periodic influx of fresh air, and shall be filtered as specified in national standards and library and archive recommended practice to protect NLM materials from the potentially destructive effects of pollutants including airborne particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, formaldehyde, peroxides and ammonia.  The storage environment must also be monitored for the presence of acetic acid that may be off-gassed from acetate-based films.

The current expectation is that an award on a sole-source basis to Iron Mountain Records Management, Boyers, PA, is the expected outcome.  Iron Mountain has consistently provided NLM with high quality storage and service in all the areas specified in this synopsis, and continues to meet national and NLM standards for film storage.  Most of the materials stored in the vaults are unique and irreplaceable.   Below-ground storage provides not only constant temperature (making it less difficult to maintain stable conditions), but provides an added measure of security.  Further, it is widely acknowledged in national and international standards, technical photographic literature and library and archives preservation literature that processed silver gelatin emulsion film and color dyes are at risk of immediate damage and/or irreversible life-expectancy reduction whenever they are subjected to fluctuations of temperature and humidity beyond recommended ranges.  Due to the relative instability of their constituent ingredients, acetate-based film materials have a considerably shorter life expectancy that polyester-based films and color images are significantly less stable than black-and-white images, making them still more vulnerable.  Additionally, exposure to light, particulate matter and gaseous pollutants is potentially destructive to the sensitive emulsion layers of films, regardless of the film base.  To attempt to relocate this material to another facility would potentially subject these unique film materials to unwarranted risks.
This award will be for a Base Year and 3 (three) successive one-year option periods.  All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of this publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  This requirement is NLM Synopsis No. NLM-08-177-KDP.  EMAILS AND FACISIMILES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional services required by the library.  The Statement of Work may be obtained by contacting the individual listed below.  The offeror shall include all information necessary to document and/or support the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  All responses from responsible sources will be considered.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 105, MSC 5488, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention: Kimberly D. Pringle, Contract Specialist, on (301) 496-1766.  Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR): htm://www.amet.gov/far/.  The following clauses and provisions shall apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008); FAR 52.212-2, Evaluations – Commercial Items (June 2008); FAR 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (June 2008) – with DUNS Number Addendum [52.204-6 (April 2008)]; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (February 2007); FAR 52.212-4, Addendum to Clause for Year 2000 Compliance (July 1997); and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (June 2008).

<p><strong>A.2 BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates two (2) Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. On aircraft N42RF, the engine in the #3 position (S/N OTH8546) was removed for compressor surge during shift from HSGI (flight idle) to LSGI (high speed ground idle). Further investigation revealed curled tips of the 5th and 10th stage compressor rotor blades and degraded engine efficiency.</p>
<p><br /><strong>A.3 SCOPE</strong><br />The Contractor shall agree to accept the engine in the Quick Engine Change (QEC), mounted on an AOC owned engine stand. The Contractor shall perform a test cell run evaluation of the engine and provide the results to the AOC. The Contractor shall provide all the necessary special tools and labor to remove the accessories and the engine from the QEC, (CLIN 0001). The Contractor shall perform a teardown of the engine power section and shall provide AOC with a detailed tear down report. The Contractor shall remove and replace or overhaul the existing compressor assembly to 0.0-hour Technical Standard Order (TSO), whichever is more cost effective. The requirement to repair (CLIN 0002 - Option One) will be based on the teardown report and analysis conducted under CLIN 0001. The requirement to replace (CLIN 0003, Option 2) will be based on the teardown report and analysis conducted under CLIN 0001. The Contractor shall reinstall the engine assembly into the QEC and perform a test cell run. Test cell run results will be evaluated by the AOC before acceptance of the engine for return to service. Maximum acceptable vibration levels of the engine upon completion of work will be discussed prior to the commencement of the contract. Under this agreement the contractor shall complete the work within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the engine at the contractor facility. The contractor shall comply with any outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and provide the AOC with any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable. The Contractor will be responsible for all, Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) and AOC required documentation, to include but not limited to, approval for return to service. No additional work shall be performed on any engine without prior approval from the CO. <br />A.3.1 Over and Above Discrepancies (CLIN 0004) is defined as any additional discrepancies outside of normal repair criteria that are discovered during performance of the work. The findings will be documented in a written report that includes parts required, labor required and a cost estimate for additional work. The Contractor shall not proceed with the additional work until approval for additional work is received from the Contracting Officer. The work shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's repair/overhaul manuals. Over and above shall be on a time and materials basis.<br />A.3.2.1 NOAA will select the Option for the repair or replacement (CLIN 0002 or CLIN 0003) within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written report/analysis. The Government is not obligated to select an option if doing so is found not to be in the Government's best interest and or funds are not available. If an option is selected, the selection will be formalized by modification to the contract.</p>
<p><br /><strong>A.4 DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:</strong> The cost of shipping the engine to the contractor facility shall be the responsibility of the Government. Return transportation will be the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p><br /><strong>A.5 INSURANCE AGAINST LOSS OR DAMAGE TO GOVERNMENT PROPERTY:</strong> The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain liability insurance of not less than $750,000.00 to cover the engine on which this work will be performed. Before award of this contract, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective: <br />1. For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe and;<br />2. Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, <br />whichever period is longer.</p>
<p><strong>A.6 PARTS, DISCOUNTS AND WARRANTIES:</strong> The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the engine. Parts or components in an "as removed" condition will not be installed in the engine. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide the labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over and above" discrepancies. Secondly, contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given. As the AOC WP-3D aircraft average only 350 per year, the Contractor shall provide the AOC with a warranty providing a minimum of five hundred hours flight time or eighteen (18) months from the time of installation of the engine.</p>
<p><strong>A.7 FAA CERTIFICATION:</strong> Maintenance contractors must provide proof that the facility performing the service is an FAA or factory (Rolls Royce) approved repair station for the T56-A-14 engine and have performed overhauls and test cell runs on this type unit within the last 90 days.</p>

<p>
<p><strong>A.1 DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared and processed in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included with this announcement. This is a solicitation for the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Tampa, FL., which is being issued for the purpose of identifying a qualified vendor to complete repairs and test runs on a Rolls Royce T56-A-14 engine (SN OTH8546). This combined synopsis notice constitutes the only Request For Proposal (RFP) and a written RFP will not be issued. This notice is hereby issued as RFP No.WC133M-08-RP-0182PY. This is an unrestricted solicitation with full and open competition. This RFP and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26. Signed and dated proposals must be submitted to the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Central Region Acquisition Division, Attn: Patsy Ybarra, 601 East 12th Street, Rm. 1756, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

Offerors sending a proposal via fax must follow up with one (1) originally signed proposal and two (2) additional copies in the mail postmarked no later than August 29, 2008.</p>
<p><strong>A.2 BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates two (2) Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. On aircraft N42RF, the engine in the #3 position (S/N OTH8546) was removed for compressor surge during shift from HSGI (flight idle) to LSGI (high speed ground idle). Further investigation revealed curled tips of the 5th and 10th stage compressor rotor blades and degraded engine efficiency. <br /><strong>A.3 SCOPE</strong><br />The Contractor shall agree to accept the engine in the Quick Engine Change (QEC), mounted on an AOC owned engine stand. The Contractor shall perform a test cell run evaluation of the engine and provide the results to the AOC. The Contractor shall provide all the necessary special tools and labor to remove the accessories and the engine from the QEC, (CLIN 0001). The Contractor shall perform a teardown of the engine power section and shall provide AOC with a detailed tear down report. The Contractor shall remove and replace or overhaul the existing compressor assembly to 0.0-hour Technical Standard Order (TSO), whichever is more cost effective. The requirement to repair (CLIN 0002 - Option One) will be based on the teardown report and analysis conducted under CLIN 0001. The requirement to replace (CLIN 0003, Option 2) will be based on the teardown report and analysis conducted under CLIN 0001. The Contractor shall reinstall the engine assembly into the QEC and perform a test cell run. Test cell run results will be evaluated by the AOC before acceptance of the engine for return to service. Maximum acceptable vibration levels of the engine upon completion of work will be discussed prior to the commencement of the contract. Under this agreement the contractor shall complete the work within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the engine at the contractor facility. The contractor shall comply with any outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and provide the AOC with any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable. The Contractor will be responsible for all, Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) and AOC required documentation, to include but not limited to, approval for return to service. No additional work shall be performed on any engine without prior approval from the CO. <br />A.3.1 Over and Above Discrepancies (CLIN 0004) is defined as any additional discrepancies outside of normal repair criteria that are discovered during performance of the work. The findings will be documented in a written report that includes parts required, labor required and a cost estimate for additional work. The Contractor shall not proceed with the additional work until approval for additional work is received from the Contracting Officer. The work shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's repair/overhaul manuals. Over and above shall be on a time and materials basis.<br />A.3.2.1 NOAA will select the Option for the repair or replacement (CLIN 0002 or CLIN 0003) within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written report/analysis. The Government is not obligated to select an option if doing so is found not to be in the Government's best interest and or funds are not available. If an option is selected, the selection will be formalized by modification to the contract. <br />A.4 DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS: The cost of shipping the engine to the contractor facility shall be the responsibility of the Government. Return transportation will be the responsibility of the contractor. <br />A.5 INSURANCE AGAINST LOSS OR DAMAGE TO GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain liability insurance of not less than $750,000.00 to cover the engine on which this work will be performed. Before award of this contract, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective: <br />1. For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe and;<br />2. Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, <br />whichever period is longer.</p>
<p>A.6 PARTS, DISCOUNTS AND WARRANTIES: The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the engine. Parts or components in an "as removed" condition will not be installed in the engine. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide the labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over and above" discrepancies. Secondly, contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given. As the AOC WP-3D aircraft average only 350 per year, the Contractor shall provide the AOC with a warranty providing a minimum of five hundred hours flight time or eighteen (18) months from the time of installation of the engine.</p>
<p>A.7 FAA CERTIFICATION: Maintenance contractors must provide proof that the facility performing the service is an FAA or factory (Rolls Royce) approved repair station for the T56-A-14 engine and have performed overhauls and test cell runs on this type unit within the last 90 days.</p>
<p>A.8 SUBMITTAL OF INVOICES: The Contractor shall submit invoices to: USDOC/NOAA/AOC, 7917 Hangar Loop Drive, Hangar 5, MacDill AFB, FL 33621, Attn: (To be determined at time of award), Contracting Officer Representative (COR). All invoices will be reviewed by the AOC to determine if the Government is receiving the best value for the services that were provided.</p>
<p>A.9 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall provide documentation that demonstrates its ability to meet the following:</p>
<p>1 Overhauled the same model engine within the past 90 days. <br />2 Copy of FAA Repair Station Certificate, and/or proof of Rolls Royce Authorized <br />Maintenance Center. <br />3 Proof of Insurance. <br />4 The Contractor's facility must be located within the United States of America (USA).<br />5 Factory trained A&amp;P technician on staff.<br />6 Warranty. <br />7 Describe shift work versus overtime.</p>
