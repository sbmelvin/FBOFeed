ACQUISITION INFORMATION:

The VA Medical Center (CVAMC) in Coatesville, PA is seeking professional Architect and Engineering (A/E) services for Project No. 542-18-104, Replace Steam & Condensate System Oval 1 & Outlying Buildings.

This announcement is being issued in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineering firms (Public Law 92-582) and implemented in the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR) Part 36. Architectural and Engineering (A/E) firms permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering are requested to send two copies of an SF 330 (8/2016 Edition) and CD from qualified and eligible firms classified as 100% SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.   

Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. This is not a Request for Proposal and an award will not be made with this announcement. This announcement is a request for SF 330s from qualified firms that meet the professional and set aside requirements listed in this announcement.

GENERAL SCOPE OF WORK: The consultant shall provide all architectural and engineering services as defined to accomplish complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports and cost estimates for the scope of work.

Existing Systems Overview:
The existing steam system consists of four water-tube boilers (Building 14   Boiler House) generating 110 psig steam and distribution throughout the campus at 60 psig to PRV and steam-to-water converters located in each building. The current boilers were installed in 1968 and the underground steam distribution was replaced in 1979.  Various segments have been replaced since. The system distributes approximately 30,000 pounds per hour during the winter to 34 buildings.
Existing steam and condensate piping between buildings is run underground. Most of the underground pipes are run between manholes in vitrified clay tile conduit, some of the underground piping runs through buried concrete vaults. The underground steam and condensate generally enter each building in a pit and run under the floor slab to the mechanical service room. Steam traps in manholes are generally not maintained due to limited accessibility and manhole conditions.
The original system had vacuum returned condensate, although vacuum return is no longer used and condensate mains are gravity drained back to the boiler plant.
The existing steam distribution system has had multiple leaks and is generally considered to be in failing condition. Insulation around underground pipes is largely ineffective due to leaks and groundwater accumulation in manholes and vaults. Many of the steam system heat exchanger and valves are not readily accessible. There are other distribution system problems as well which will be discussed during the A/E site investigation.
Scope of Work:

This project will comprehensively redesign the entire steam distribution system from the boiler plant to the mechanical service rooms in all Oval 1 and outlying buildings.  Underground drip leg locations and pipe pitches must be fully evaluated for efficient condensate evacuation with steam drip stations in more accessible locations. New routing should be considered. The redesign must include relocation of service room equipment, or installation of platforms to facilitate appropriate accessibility.
The redesign must also evaluate down-sizing of the system by removing some outlying buildings from the system and reserving those buildings with other means of heating, such as gas-fired boilers or geothermal heat pumps.
The goal of the project is to minimize steam and heat losses and to maximize energy savings and long term maintainability.  This project will include any associated work necessary to implement the selected corrections.  This project must be designed to have minimal downtime during construction and shall be in accordance with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements, industry standards and all applicable code requirements.
The scope of work includes but is not limited to the following:
Sizing calculations of all steam and condensate mains.
Reconfiguration of the distribution system where appropriate.
Redesign of condensate removal and return systems for effective operation with ease of maintenance.
Evaluation of restrictions due to existing underground utilities and structures.  Involve a subsurface utility locating service as required.
Involve a certified industrial hygienist (CIH) to incorporate the necessary guidance in the construction documents as applicable.
Provide submittals and final documents as indicated below.

The Following Investigative Work shall also be included Within the Scope of this Project:

Perform a Code analysis to insure that the applicable Codes are being applied.
Provide any civil, structural, architectural, electrical and mechanical and underground utility investigative work of existing systems necessary to insure the accuracy of your design.
Prepare any measured drawings of existing systems or facility required to insure the accuracy of your design.

<p><strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Cardiology Catheterization Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) requires a Cryocath Ablation System. This is important and essential piece of equipment will assist the physicians in performing delicate cardiac ablations of the heart. During a cardiac ablation procedure, pressurized liquid nitrous oxide (N2O) is delivered from a tank in the Cryocath Ablation System. The liquid refrigerant travels in an ultra-fine tube through the coaxial umbilical and the shaft of the cryoablation catheter to the tip of the catheter. The liquid refrigerant vaporizes as it is sprayed into the tip. As it vaporizes, it absorbs heat from the surrounding tissue, thereby cooling and freezing the target tissue. The warmed refrigerant is vacuumed back to the Cryocath Ablation System through a large lumen within the shaft of the catheter and coaxial umbilical. The Cryocath Ablation System discharges the vapor into the hospital scavenging system.</p>
<p><strong>ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS:</strong></p>
<p>The Cryocath Ablation System houses the electrical and mechanical components and software needed to perform cryoablation procedures. It controls the delivery, recovery, and disposal of cryoablation refrigerant safely and efficiently. The Cryocath Ablation System encompasses the electrical and mechanical components and proprietary software for controlling a cryotherapy procedure with the Arctic Front Advance and Freezor MAX catheters. It stores and controls the delivery of the liquid refrigerant (N20) through the coaxial umbilical to the catheter, recovers the refrigerant vapor from the catheter under constant vacuum, and disposes of the refrigerant through the hospital scavenging system.

<p><strong>Attention</strong> Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENTION</strong> all potential respondents: <br />If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. <strong>Capability Survey Questions:</strong><br />1. Name of country where the Cryocath Ablation System is manufactured.<br />2. Describe briefly the capabilities of your facility and the nature of the services you provide. Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.<br />3. Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement. Include contract number and date, a brief description, agency/organization supported, and point of contact name and telephone number.<br />4. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?<br />5. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, <strong>submit your responses</strong> to <strong><a href="mailto:paula.williams.4@us.af.mil">paula.williams.4@us.af.mil</a>.</strong> E-mail responses should be received no later than <strong>10:30 A.M. EST on 06 November 2017</strong>.</p>
<p>All responses must be UNCLASSIFIED; no classified material will be accepted or considered with this Sources Sought Synopsis. The response to Part I. Business Information should be single spaced, 12pt font. The response to Part II. Capabilities should be limited to no more than 10 pages (8.5x11 inches), single spaced, 12pt font. In addition, identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. The Air Force will handle proprietary items in accordance with FAR 2.101 and 3.104.</p>
<p>Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on this FedBizOpps website, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's response. Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the sources sought assessments are completed. An Industry Day (date to be determined) with one-on-one information sessions with respondents may be offered to clarify the Government's understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "Cryocath Ablation System" If this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to email.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to the RFI. Information identified as proprietary will not be released. Only summaries of data provided under this RFI are releasable to the public.</p>
<p>Responses to, or lack of response to, this RFI will not impact consideration for award from responses to future RFP(s) issued for this or related potential requirements.<br />Introduction<br />Aerial Imagery is one of several critical geospatial datasets the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) uses to complete its mission. Imagery has been collected and used by the Agency for the last 80 years and is currently used millions of times daily by FSA in desktop, web based, and enterprise applications to support FSA's primary customers, America's farmers and ranchers. The FSA Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) has the authority as delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture to the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services to coordinate and prevent duplication of aerial photographic work of the Department, and among other activities, to coordinate and perform procurement, inspection, and application of specifications for USDA aerial photography, and make reproductions of the photography available upon request. 7 CFR Part 2, Subpart C, &sect;2.16, and 7 CFR 2.42.<br />While the general FSA mission has remained constant, major business and technological changes have impacted imagery requirements as well as requirements related to imagery delivery mechanisms.<br />Basic Scope and Intent of RFI<br />The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) intends to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) anticipating award of a single year contract for 2018 only to meet current requirements while the agency explores options for meeting future agency requirements under reduced budgets. This RFP may potentially be awarded to a single contractor with options for additional states and deliverables that may be awarded depending upon funding availability and need. The draft RFP sections that are pertinent to this RFI are attached. Please refer to the map below for the planned priority states for 2018.<br />The general requirements are for imagery collected during specific agriculture growing seasons, based on a three-year cycle, and delivered in 60cm resolution DOQQ (Digital Orthorectified Quarter Quadrangle) format with four meter horizontal accuracy. Compressed County Mosaics (CCM) will be included as option items that may be awarded depending upon funding availability and need.<br />FSA is seeking comments and responses to questions pertaining to this RFP, as well as comments and responses pertaining to acquisition strategy, deliverables, pricing, etc.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. <br />Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990, and the size standard is $15.0 employees.<br /><br /><br />a. Background: The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.<br />The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.<br />The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&amp;IS) provides imaging services to the patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes. Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures). Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&amp;IS's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS). The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&amp;IS's Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Center's Hospital Information System (CRIS). <br />b. The purpose of this market research is to obtain capability statements- Any potential offeror must demonstrate the following:<br />The ability to develop and validate an easy -to-use and fully integrated navigation system for needle placement during image guided cancer diagnosis and treatment. Applications include but are not limited to biopsy, various thermal ablations (e.tg. radiofrequency, cryo-, microwave, and laser ablation) and brachytherapy.<br />The goal of this contract is to improve needle placement in clinical practice. The result of this requirement is a fully integrated needle-guidance system prototype that is ready for human clinical trials. The system will be prototyped and evaluated in a live animal/human study to quantify the targeting accuracy and workflow for Computerized Tomography(CT), Cone beam CT, and Ultrasound-guided procedures.<br />This equipment will be used in the Center for Interventional Oncology, at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (CC/NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, in accordance with the duties identified in the Statement of Work, and according to the terms outlined in the final contract.<br />Responses must be submitted to the OPC Contract Specialist referenced below no later than October 30, 2017, at 11:a.m. (eastern). Responses shall be limited to 10 pages.</p>

THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
 IS SEEKING CLINICAL SPACE
 IN THE CAPE MAY, CAPE MAY COUNTY, NEW JERSEY AREA

The Department of Veterans Affairs desires to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield no more than 7,200 of contiguous net usable square feet (NUSF) within the boundaries established below in the Cape May, Cape May County, New Jersey area.  This space is for use as a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) by the Wilmington VA Medical Center, Wilmington, Pennsylvania.  All space must be located on the first floor of a building and must meet all Government requirements for fire safety and ADA accessibility.  On-site parking is required for a minimum of 50 vehicles, containing 20% ADA accessible spaces.  The Government will consider both existing and build to suit properties.  A 10 year lease is being considered for a firm term of five (5) years with a one   five (5) year soft term with termination rights after the firm term.
Space is required to be located within the Cape May, Cape May County, New Jersey area, specifically space will only be acceptable if it is within or fronting the boundaries outlined: Beginning at the intersection of Middle Township bike path and Courthouse South Dennis Road, take Courthouse South Dennis Road to Winding Way, then take Winding Way to Route 9, take Route 9 to Route 609, take Route 609 to Garden State Parkway, take Garden State Parkway to Locust Avenue, take Locust Avenue to Route 9, take Route 9 to West Pacific Avenue, take West Pacific Avenue to Middle Township bike path, take Middle Township bike path to Courthouse South Dennis Road the place of beginning and includes all properties that border either side of the roadways or paths that make up the boundaries.
The delineated area boundaries were selected because they are centrally located within Cape May County area which has one of the largest veteran populations and provides the greatest accessibility to veterans who are projected to utilize the new CBOC.  The average travel time for veterans to reach the CBOC within the delineated area will be 15 min. or 14.2 miles and is within a 1 mile radius of the NJ Transit System Bus Line.  Additionally, the boundaries encompass the commercial district of Cape May which provides increased veteran accessibility due to the availability of public transportation within the described delineated area.
A market survey of properties offered for lease will be conducted by VA, interested offerors (Owners, broker or their legal representatives) should contact James R. MacIntyre II by telephone, mail or email no later than 3:00 PM November 9, 2017 (EST), at the following address: James R. MacIntyre (90), James E.

The Government is limited by law (40 USC 278a. as Amended 10-01-1981) to pay no more than the appraised fair rental value for space.  Please note:  This advertisement is not a solicitation for offerors, nor is it a request for proposals.

DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
Health Care for Homeless Veterans Program
Medical Respite

Part 1

General Information


GENERAL:  This is a non-personnel services contract to provide care, treatment, and rehabilitative services, including case management services; and therapeutic transitional housing assistance for the Health Care for Homeless Veterans Programs (HCHV).  The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein.  Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. 

Description of Services/Introduction:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform Health Care for Homeless Veterans as defined in this Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as Government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.

Background:  

The central goal of the HCHV program is to reduce homelessness among Veterans by conducting outreach to those who are the most vulnerable and who are not currently receiving VA services, and then engaging them in treatment and rehabilitation as well as in other VA programs and non-VA community programs that provide prevention and support services. 
The HCHV program was developed from the original Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill (HCMI) Program, a six month pilot project, established February 12, 1987. 
In recent years, VA s effort to eliminate Veteran homelessness has led to the development of a range of additional programs and initiatives implemented by VHA Central Office, Office of Clinical Operations, and Homeless Programs Office. Additionally, programs such as Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) have been expanded to include programmatic components that address the gaps in services for homeless Veterans.  Because HCHV programs typically are the first to make contact with homeless Veterans, they frequently serve as the entry point for these services and thus, provide VA a way to outreach, assist, and offer homeless Veterans an  Open Door  to the continuum of VA services. 
In addition to this core mission, HCHV functions as a mechanism to contract with providers for community-based residential treatment for homeless Veterans. 
Because the least disruptive and most economically efficient way to end homelessness is to prevent its occurrence, VA has expanded its homeless initiatives to include support services aimed at the prevention of homelessness.  Unlike VA s traditional homeless programs, which focus on treatment and rehabilitation of the individual Veteran, prevention services address those Veterans and their families who are at immediate risk for becoming homeless or who have recently become homeless.  This group includes Veterans recently released from prison or who are otherwise involved with the criminal justice system.  HCHV programs are well positioned to assist these Veterans in accessing the appropriate level of services through other VA programs and non-VA community programs. 
The HCHV program is vital for providing a gateway to VA and community-based supportive services for eligible Veterans who are homeless.  This includes ensuring that chronically homeless Veterans and/or those with serious mental health diagnoses can be placed in community-based programs that provide quality housing and services that meet the needs of these special populations. 

Objectives: 
Clinical Assessment to provide determination of strengths, needs abilities and preference of each Veteran
Initiation of case management to plan and coordinate the homeless Veteran s care 

Scope:  HCHV Services address the cause and effects of homelessness in a community-based setting that provides direct services in a safe environment that supports recovery and meets the needs of homeless Veterans.  Services include short-term residential treatment to Veterans who need an immediate housing placement as they seek permanent housing and/or additional care and services. The target population is eligible homeless Veterans who are being discharged from a hospital, received care in the Emergency Department, or other VA clinic and do not require hospital level care. The Veterans who are served have acute and post-acute medical care needs and/or who are too ill or frail to recover from a physical illness or injury independently, but who are not ill enough to be in a hospital.  The Veterans served also need to be independent in Activities of Daily Living, unlike  respite  for caregivers,  medical respite  is a short-tern residential care that allows homeless individuals the opportunity to rest in a safe environment while accessing medical care and other supportive services.  HCHV services may be responsible for the direct provision of case management and additional care and services.  Additional care and services may include, but are not limited to, vocational training and skills development, and mental health and/or Substance Use Disorder (SUD) counseling.
 
Period of Performance:  The period of performance of this contract shall be for a five year period.

Quality Control:  The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective quality control program to ensure services are performed in accordance with this PWS.  The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.

As a minimum, the contractor shall develop QC procedures addressing the quality indicators.   Within 30 days after contract award, Contractor shall submit electronic copies (compatible with Microsoft Word or PDF) of a comprehensive written QCP to the Contracting Officer (CO) and COR.  Contractor shall submit copies of revisions to the QCP to the CO and COR within five working days when changes are made thereafter.  After acceptance of the quality control plan the contractor shall receive the CO s acceptance in writing of any proposed change to his QC system.

Target and prioritize homeless Veterans transitioning from literal street homelessness, Veterans being discharged from institutions, including those in need of medical respite, and Veterans who recently became homeless and require safe and stable living arrangements while they seek permanent housing. CERS Programs, either directly or through linkage with community and other VA services, provide time-limited services such as supporting mental health stabilization, SUD treatment services, and enhancement of independent living skills, vocational training, and employment services. Emphasis is placed on referral and placement in permanent housing or longer term residential programs utilizing VA and/or community resources. Lengths of stay in CERS typically range from 30 to 90 days with the option to extend based on clinical need. NOTE: CERS programs represent a consolidation of existing HCHV contract residential programs, previously designated as either residential treatment (RT) or emergency housing (EH). Since varying levels of supportive services have been present in both, as noted above, this consolidation reflects the range and flexibility of these services as currently constituted.

CONTRACTOR.  A supplier or vendor awarded a contract to provide specific supplies or service to the government.  The term used in this contract refers to the prime contractor.

CONTRACTING OFFICER (CO).  A person with authority to enter into, administer, and or terminate contracts, and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the government.  Note: The only individual who can legally bind the government.

CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR).   An employee of the U.S. Government appointed by the contracting officer to assist with administering the contract.  Such appointment shall be in writing and shall state the scope of authority and limitations.  This individual has authority to provide technical direction to the Contractor as long as that direction is within the scope of the contract, does not constitute a change, and has no funding implications.  This individual does NOT have authority to change the terms and conditions of the contract. 

COMMUNITY INTEGRATION.  Community integration (CI) refers to a person s belonging and full participation in society. CI traditionally has been defined by three main areas: employment or other productive activity, independent living, and social activity. 

CHRONICALLY HOMELESS.  The HCHV program follows the Federal definition of the term  chronically homeless  from section 401 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 11360

DEFECTIVE SERVICE.  A service output that does not meet the standard of performance associated with the Performance Work Statement.

DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE.  A schedule of deliverables associated with the PWS.  See ATTACHMENT 4 Deliverable Schedule.

HEALTH CARE FOR HOMELESS VETERANS PROGRAM.  The Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program is an essential and critical part of VHA, providing a gateway to VA and community-based supportive services for eligible Veterans who are homeless. HCHV programs provide outreach services; care, treatment, and rehabilitative services, including case management services; and therapeutic transitional housing assistance under 38 U.S.C. 2032 in conjunction with Work Therapy under 38 U.S.C. 1718. The program uses Contracted Residential Services (see paragraph 5.d.) in community locations to engage homeless Veterans who have been underserved. Many of these Veterans would benefit from mental health and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment but will not avail themselves of these services without the encouragement of outreach workers. 

HOMELESS.  The HCHV Program follows the definition of  homeless  in 38 U.S.C. 2002(1) and section 103(a) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 11302 (a).  NOTE: the term  homeless  or  homeless individual  does not include any individual imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or state law.

HOMELESS OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION SYSTEM.  The Homeless Operations Management and Evaluations System (HOMES) is an online data collection system that tracks homeless Veterans as they move through VA s Homeless Programs.  The system streamlines data collection processes and facilitates communication between VA homeless program staff and leadership on the local, regional, and national levels.  By providing a centralized data collection system, HOMES enables VA to efficiently and effectively collect and manage access homeless Veteran data.  Historically, when a Veteran entered a new VA homeless program or episode of care, homeless program staff would re-enter Veteran data into a program-specific system resulting in duplicated data across separate homeless program systems. Further, these systems did not share information about the Veteran and the care received. The HOMES system allows for single entry of Veteran data and satisfies program operations, management, and evaluation requirements. Any entry into the system is available to all homeless staff across all Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN). HOMES is designed so that critical data elements are compatible with HUD s Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), allowing VA and HUD to meet the goals of integrating community and VA data into a single Registry. 

HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.  The Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) is a computerized data collection tool specifically designed to capture client level information over time on the characteristics and service needs of men, women, and children experiencing homelessness and the services provided to them. HMIS implementations can encompass geographic areas ranging from a single county to an entire state and are administered locally within the community (Continuum of Care) by one lead agency that is responsible for standards and privacy compliance, as well as HUD reporting and other funder required aggregate reporting. 

KEY PERSONNEL.  Contractor personnel that are evaluated in a source selection process and that may be required to be used in the performance of a contract by the Key Personnel listed in the PWS.

MEDICAL RESPITE.  Medical respite refers to acute and post-acute medical care provided for homeless persons who are too ill or frail to recover from a physical illness or injury independently, but who are not ill enough to be in a hospital. Unlike  respite  for caregivers,  medical respite  is short-term residential care that allows homeless individuals the opportunity to rest in a safe environment while accessing medical care and other supportive services. Medical respite care can be offered in a variety of settings including freestanding facilities, homeless shelters, nursing homes, and transitional housing. The care can be provided through any one of a number of different models, including a visiting care team (e.g., visiting nurses, rotating teams), an in-house clinical team, and/or in direct consultation with an established care team at a medical facility in such a way that therapeutic care can be provided and a treatment plan can be carried out at the respite facility. 

NEGATIVE DISCHARGE. When: a.) the Veteran whereabouts are unknown; b.) the Veteran has had an episode of violence or has threatened violence against staff or other Veterans and must be discharged to maintain the safety of the facility; c.) the Veteran has had  more than one episode of drug use at the facility, has failed to engage in or accept treatment alternatives, and must be discharged to maintain a safe and sober environment at the facility; d.) the Veteran s length of stay has exceeded 180 days from the date of admission and the COR has not approved continuation of treatment.  

PER DIEM: the VA will pay for the eligible Veteran s stay in a residential treatment bed for each day the Veteran resides at the facility.  The VA also refers to this as  bed days of care.   Unless specifically excluded in this contract, the per diem rate established will include the services or supplies normally provided other patients by the facility without extra charge.  It is the contractor s responsibility to have appropriate systems of verification of services in place to justify invoices and payments.  VA pays per diem for each eligible Veteran s exclusive use of a residential treatment bed within a facility.  Therefore, the contractor may not bill the VA and the VA will not pay per diem for beds that are used by more than one person at a time, such as in shifts.  For example, it is not permissible to bill the VA for a bed that was used by an eligible Veteran at night but then given to someone else to sleep in during the day while the eligible Veteran was attending appointments outside of the facility. Contractors may only bill the VA for bed days of care for Veterans who are actively residing at the facility.  

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY.  The contractor service requirements are summarized into performance objectives that relate directly to mission essential items.  The performance threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable levels of service required for each requirement.  These thresholds are critical to mission success. See ATTACHMENT 3 Performance Requirements Summary.

PHYSICAL SECURITY.  Actions that prevent the loss or damage of Government property.

POSITIVE DISCHARGE. When: a.) the Veteran has been successfully placed as anticipated in transitional or permanent housing, or reunited with family, and has met the goals of his/her Individual Service Plan within 90 days or less; b.) the Veteran has been successfully placed as anticipated in transitional or permanent housing, or reunited with family, and has met the goals of his/her Individual Service Plan in greater than 90 days from the date of admission and the COR has approved continuation of fixed daily charge for payment. This information applies to Veterans approved to stay beyond 90 days as clinically warranted.

QUALITY ASSURANCE.  The Government procedures to verify that services being performed by the Contractor are performed according to acceptable standards.

QUALITY ASSURANCE Surveillance Plan (QASP).  An organized written document specifying the surveillance methodology to be used for surveillance of contractor performance.  

QUALITY CONTROL.  All necessary measures taken by the Contractor to assure that the quality of an end product or service shall meet contract requirements.

RECOVERY MODEL.  The recovery model is centered on the belief that it is possible for homeless Veterans with mental health conditions to re-establish normal roles in the community. The recovery model fully supports community integration and improved quality of life for Veterans who have been diagnosed with a serious mental health condition that impairs their ability to lead meaningful lives. Within this model, psychiatric rehabilitation services are collaborative and encourage the Veteran s self-determination. 

SUBCONTRACTOR.  One that enters into a contract with a prime contractor.  The Government does not have privity of contract with the subcontractor.

SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.  Supportive Housing is a combination of housing and services intended as a cost-effective way to help people live more stable, productive lives. Supportive housing is widely believed to work well for those who face the most complex challenges individuals and families confronted with homelessness and who also have very low incomes and/or serious, persistent health issues. Supportive housing can be coupled with social services such as job training, life skills training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, community support services, and case management. Supportive housing is intended to be an efficient, pragmatic solution that improves quality of life and, to the extent feasible, reduces the overall cost of care. 

SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. Supportive Services encompass a range of services that assist an individual in the transition from the streets or shelters into permanent or permanent supportive housing and that assist persons with living successfully in housing. Examples of supportive services include, but are not limited to: assistance in securing permanent housing; vocational assistance, including mentoring and coaching as well as job placement; income assistance and financial planning; relapse prevention; and social and recreational activities.

TREATMENT TEAM. Treatment team includes: VA HCHV Social Worker, VA HCHV Program Manager, Contractor Clinical Supervisor, and Contractor Case Manager.

UNACCEPTABLE DISCHARGE.  When:  a.) the Veteran is discharged to a homeless shelter or drop in setting after a length of stay greater than seven (7) days from the date of admission unless there is concurrence from the COR that there is no other alternative due to circumstances beyond the Contractor s control; b.) the Veteran is discharged to the streets at any point in time after the date of admission under any circumstances.

VETERAN.  A Veteran, for the purpose of HCHV programs, is a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable and is enrolled or eligible for VA health care under 38 CFR 17.36 or 17.37. An eligible veteran must meet the criteria specified in 38 CFR 63.3 to qualify for benefits under the HCHV program.

Length of Stay is 60 days from date of admission but can be variable based on progress towards goals, objectives, and time frames listed in the treatment plan with VA Case Manager and COR approval.  The timing of transition to the community is negotiated between the Veteran and the team.  Contractor s staff are responsible for ensuring that access barriers to continuing outpatient care (e.g., distance, transportation, scheduling) are reduced or eliminated.

Veterans may end participation in HCHV Contract Residential Services for any of the following reasons: 
The Veteran has accomplished the goals as defined in the treatment plan and is prepared for community integration with identified resources after exit. 
The Veteran requires treatment beyond program resources and is to transition to another level of care. 
The Veteran has failed to adhere to the rules and the regulations of the program. 
The treatment environment does not meet the Veteran s expectations or needs. 
The Veteran requests to leave before treatment goals are met.
The Veteran has a personal emergency necessitating exit. 

There are circumstances when the treatment team may make a clinical decision to discharge a Veteran prior to program completion. These circumstances include: 
The Veteran exhibits dangerous and/or threatening behavior; 
The Veteran exhibits a pattern of relapse or unauthorized use of an addictive substance and a lack of engagement in treatment services. 
The Veteran refuses to engage in treatment planning. 
The Veteran has achieved maximum benefit from treatment in the program. 
The Veteran refuses to allow communication between VA and the Contractor that is necessary to ensure the safe and effective coordination of care. 

Whether the Veteran ends participation in the program, has completed the program, or is in the process of being discharged by the Contractor, the Contractor shall ensure the following occurs: 
The Veteran is involved in the exit planning process. 
The Veteran is provided clear information regarding exit. 
Continuity of VA and non-VA services for medical and mental health needs are arranged. The HCHV program staff is included in decisions regarding the setting and frequency of ongoing treatment and community recovery activities. 
The treatment team will follow-up with the Veteran post-discharge to facilitate access to continuing aftercare services. 
An assessment of the Veteran s dangerousness and overall mental health stability is made by the treatment team and appropriate action taken, according to the Contractor s policy. 
If the Veteran does not have permanent housing, the Contractor shall provide information that facilitates arrangements for transitional or temporary housing. 
The Contractor shall inform HCHV program staff of the Veteran s exit within 24 hours. 

If a Veteran refuses to participate in exit planning or if a Veteran drops out of treatment without seeing or contacting Contractor s staff, the Contractor shall notify the HCHV program staff, and assess the level of risk.  If the Veteran is deemed to be an immediate danger to him or herself or others, the Contractor shall call the Veteran Crisis line (800-273-8255) for assistance.  If safety concerns persist, local 911 should be called.

Video Otoscopy is the use of an Otoscope (this is an instrument used to look in the ears) that has a very tiny video camera that transmits images to a television screen.  These scopes use fiber optics to transmit a very bright light that illuminates the ear canal.  In addition, Video Otoscopes have a working channel that allows the ear to be irrigated and vacuumed dry to help remove debris that can cover important structures or changes within the ear.  The channel can also be used by instruments that can grab objects or tissue samples for cleaning or diagnostic purposes.  We can take and print digital images of anything we find within the ear canal.  Video Otoscopes are being procured to allow integration and compatibility with current Video Otoscopes in use.  
This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the offeror indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with J.J. Crewe &amp; Son, Inc. for maintenance of the Government-owned Sullair Helium Compressor Skids. The newly-commissioned compressor skids are due to be serviced and it must be done prior to January 2018 in order to prepare them to the support the Hydrogen Cold Sources at NIST's Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The scope of work for this order is a service/maintenance contract for NIST-owned Sullair (Model Number: PCC25S-22-10M; Serial Numbers: 201305060052 and 201301300070) compressor skids at the NIST facility in Gaithersburg, MD. Maintenance and repair work are intended to keep the compressor skids operating to the original manufacturer's specifications and to allow them to operate without extended interruption and achieve their optimal performance. Inquiries to the manufacturer about a potential servicer of their equipment revealed that J.J. Crewe &amp; Son, Inc. is the only company authorized to complete maintenance on the equipment. In addition, the equipment that needs to be maintained is proprietary to the original OEM. Due to the proprietary nature, third-party vendors do not have access to OEM replacement parts and oil.</p>
<p>Performance shall occur at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus within six (6) weeks from the date of purchase order award.</p>
<p>Research has found that only one (1) company can meet the requirements as it requires maintenance professionals with particular credentials and training and access to OEM parts, which can ONLY be obtained directly from J.J. Crewe &amp; Son, Inc.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333912, and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. Eastern on November 1, 2017. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to january.magyar@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

<DESC>After 40 years of heavy use, the Existing Office Building (EOB) is in need of a major renovation. The building's architecture character has survived the forty years, without major modifications to the original design concept.   The electrical/communication systems are antiquated and repeated additions and modifications to the original wiring have made the electrical system increasingly unsafe.  The mechanical system is in a similar condition due to age and continued use.  The plumbing system, consisting largely of iron pipe has exceeded its normal life expectancy and leaks are increasing in frequency.
<p>The scope for the project includes construction of a series of much needed building systems improvements for the Chancery building.  The project includes the following: new mechanical systems for heating, air-conditioning, and ventilation; new electrical infrastructure and lightning protection; new plumbing; new telephone and data infrastructure;  new technical security systems, life safety improvements (egress pathways, stair upgrades, and fire rated corridors); new fire suppression/alarm system and water tank; limited interior modifications; and new furniture.</p>
<p>Estimated construction cost: $28 - 40 million.</p>

A formal RFP under the same solicitation number will be released at a later date yet to be determined. Please review this DRAFT and&nbsp;submit any questions or comments via ProjNet as part of the Bidder Inquiry per instructions included in this DRAFT RFP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scope of this DRAFT RFP contains paving requirements under the Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (FSRM) program which will include all work required for design build (DB)/design-bid-build (DBB) paving projects for existing military and civil stakeholders located within the Front Range (Colorado and Wyoming) Area of Responsibility (AOR). The Government intends to award up to five (5) contracts under this SB MATOC. The work shall be in accordance with the RFP documents issued within this DRAFT RFP. The competition of this contract is restricted to Small Business (SB) concerns. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237310 (Highway, Street and Bridge Construction) with a size standard of $36.5M.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) will be available for paving projects located within the Front Range AOR, the preponderance of the work for this contract is projected to be at Ft. Carson, CO. The MATOC will be awarded with a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period. The total value of all task orders awarded under the MATOC will not exceed $49M.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RFPs for projects will be issued under individual task orders. Task orders may range from $100,000 to $10,000,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The general scope of work for this paving MATOC will consist of FSRM-funded projects for various types of pavement structures constructed of either Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) or Asphaltic Concrete (AC). Structures include roads, streets, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, recreational/mixed use trails, and maintenance hardstands and do not include any paving related to airfield aprons, taxiways, or runways. Types of improvements include, but are not limited to, new roadway/street pavement construction (either PCC or AC), new sitework (sidewalks, trails, etc.) construction (PCC), and pavement restoration (mill and overlay, crack sealing/repair, joint sealing/repair) and other work associated with the 237310 NAICS code. Improvements may also include road striping and traffic signage. Task orders may also include incidental utilities and storm drainage work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This NAICS code 237310 (Highway, Street and Bridge Construction) will typically be used for FSRM paving requirements on military installations as well as some civil works facilities and Interagency support projects such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Veterans Affairs (VA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The industry for NAICS code 237310 is comprised of establishments primarily engaged in the construction of highways (including elevated), streets, roads, airport runways, public sidewalks, or bridges. The work performed may include new work, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repairs. Specialty trade contractors are included in this group if they are engaged in activities primarily related to highway, street, and bridge construction (e.g., installing guardrails on highways).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Disinfecting Port Protectors. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong><br /><br />These Disinfecting Port Protectors products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Disinfecting Port Protectors in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Disinfecting Port Protectors will be established approximately February 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2018 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Disinfecting Port Protectors. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disinfecting Port Protectors.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disinfecting Port Protectors. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $282,342.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($282,342.00) of the total volume in sales ($282,342.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong><br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification.<strong> A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br />
<p>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3.

See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor offered products shall be TAA compliant. End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Stethoscopes. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Stethoscopes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Stethoscopes in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs. <br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885. <br /><br />The QSL for Stethoscopes will be established approximately February 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2018 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Stethoscopes. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Stethoscopes. <br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Stethoscopes. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,268,457. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five (5) items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 74% ($938,605.70) of the total volume in sales of $1,268,457. The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for.

<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov. <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, October 30, 2017.</p>

<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.<br />(i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or specifications prepared or furnished by the Government.

(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-71 - Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)<br />(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent.

<p>1352.271-72 - Additional Item Requirements (Air)-Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes-Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule:<br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance.<br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:<br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging.<br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:<br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided.<br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.<br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.

However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings are not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, November 3, 2017.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8730 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Advisor/Senior Transition Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field, to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The Transition Advisor/Senior Transition Advisor is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.<br /> <br />The OTI Transition Advisor/Senior Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) that they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.

The government intends to award one contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government.</p>
<p>This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95, Defense Acquisition Circular DPN 20161222, and Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Revision #26.</p>
<p>See the attached CLIN Structure Price Sheet (Attachment 1) in accordance with FAR 12.603(c)(v).</p>
<p>This solicitation is 100% set aside for small business. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 721110. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $32.5 millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (July 2016) Alternate I (Oct 2014), or ensure the Representations and Certifications are updated at www.sam.gov.

Attachment 2 identifies the applicable clauses and provisions to this RFQ. All clauses and provisions may be found in full text at the following site: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>2. Description of Requirement. The Government has a need to acquire conference space and amenities (i.e; breakfast, lunch, water) for informational meetings. This requirement is for temporary use on a non-recurring basis. The need is for no less than Four (4) rooms total: One (1) general concession room to accommodate Four Hundred (400) attendees, comprised of single and family units. Two (2) general use rooms to accommodate Twenty Five (25) children and appropriate staff between the two rooms: One (1) Small Meeting space that can accommodate 5 people at Sacramento, CA 95814 (10 mile radius) on 4th of November, 2017.</p>
<p>3. Basis for Award. The Government intends to award without discussions one Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the acquisition of conference space. Award will be made to the lowest price responsible offeror that is determined to be technically acceptable. The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all.</p>
<p>Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are highly encouraged to quote their most advantageous pricing in their initial response. The responses to this RFQ are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions unless discussions are deemed to be necessary.</p>
<p>4. Best Value Evaluation. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made as Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: A) Price, B) Technical, and C) Past Performance Factors.</p>
<p>A. Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the price sheet by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). The TEP is a two-part computation. First, the offeror's total proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Price Proposal Worksheet by the unit price, limited to two decimal places, for each CLIN to confirm the extended total amount for each CLIN; the sum of all extended amounts will be the offeror's total proposed price. Second, the total proposed price will constitute the TEP.</p>
<p>B. Technical and past performance factors will be evaluated by the ratings listed below. The failure of an offeror to meet the requirements of a factor or subfactor will result in an unacceptable rating. The technical, past performance, and subcontracting plan factors will receive one of the ratings listed below: <br />(1) Acceptable: Quote clearly meets the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(2) Unacceptable: The quote does not clearly meet the requirements of the <br />solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Technical and Past Performance Factors: The Government will evaluate the offers for being technically acceptable and for being rated acceptable or unacceptable for past performance, assigning the ratings as described in the paragraph above. The failure of an offer to meet any or all of the technical criteria will result in a technically unacceptable rating and preclude award. A rating of unacceptable for one or more technical subfactors will constitute an overall rating of unacceptable for the technical evaluation.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical. The Government will determine acceptability based on Contractor ability to provide adequate location and amenity requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance. The Government will determine acceptability based on either Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) or from other sources (if necessary). Recency of past performance is determined by work completed within the past three (3) years. Relevancy is based on providing conference space. If an offeror has no recent or relevant past performance, past performance will be treated as neutral, resulting in an acceptable rating.</p>
<p>5. Additional Instructions to Offerors. Vendors shall respond to this RFQ via email by October 27, 2017 by 3:00 P.M. Pacific Standard Time (PST). All quotes should be sent to the Contract Specialist, Javier Duran at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">javier.v.duran.mil@mail.mil</span> before the due date and time specified. Any quote, modification, or revision of a quote received after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is "late" and may not be considered.</p>
<p>All offers must list DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC, and phone number. To obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit https://www.sam.gov. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an Offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>Vendor must also be registered in Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) to receive payment through electronic funds transfer. If you are not currently registered, please visit the following website https://wawf.eb.mil/to complete your registration.</p>

How many Copies?<br />1 Electronically submitted copy &nbsp;to <a href="mailto:robert.niedzwiecki@usda.gov">robert.niedzwiecki@usda.gov</a>&nbsp; and to fbo.gov <br /><br />When is the dead line for questions. <br />October 25th&nbsp;3 PM.<br /><br />Nursing 2nd set of questions.
<p>On the Period of Performance, the statement of work has listed BASE + 2 years, however, under the instructions to offerors, it is listed as BASE + 3 years... Which is being offered with this solicitation?</p>
<p>Base and 2 years. The base and 2 years will be evaluated for price evaluation. Leave the third year blank. If the third year is priced only the base and two years will be evaluated for pricing purposes.</p>
<p>The FAR instructions and evaluation criteria sections both mention technical capability, but neither elaborates on what information the USDA is seeking in that regard. Do bidders need to include resumes/licensing for potential on-call candidates to fill the four RN positions?</p>
<p>It is assumed by bidding on this requirement one has the capacity to fulfill the licensing requirement for RN's in Washington DC or Maryland. Upon arrival for duty the nurse will be required to provide proof she is a registered licensed nurse within the jurisdiction and has five years of experience. This information can be provided ahead of time. The emphasis is on response time in filling substitute nurses.</p>
<p>Or will a general description of Bidder's capabilities suffice?</p>
<p>The bidder needs to explain how randomly one or up to four positions cane be filled within a short notice, for a day, week or two weeks.</p>
<p>The evaluation criteria also makes mention of Past Performance, but there appear to be no specific instructions on the kind or quantity of references are required. How many references should Bidders include in their responses? Can these be federal, state, and/or commercial?</p>
<p>The Past Performance will focus on how the vendor performed in providing replacement nurses on a short notice. It can be federal, state or commercial. However the vendor must provide contact information for verification purposes. Up to five references is sufficient.</p>
<p>Is the 480 HR quantity the maximum amount of hours the USDA anticipates needing?</p>
<p>Yes, 480 hours per year to fill in as a substitute nurse.</p>
<p>Will the USDA consider extending the response date given that submission instructions were issued belatedly<br />No</p>

<DESC>Q&amp;A Amendment
<p><br />Q1) Can we use client's caging if needed?</p>
<p>A1)  Yes, the client's caging can be used if needed.  However the vendor will have to have the appropriate equipment to clean the caging properly; assumption is the vendor has a cage-washer.  We would prefer if the vendor has caging to supplement our donated caging.</p>

The blood is then irradiated with 2500 cGy utilizing the Walter Reed Hospital irradiator. Blood donor animals will have a CBC done prior to donation to confirm the absence of anemia.</p>
<p>Whole blood will be transfused if PLT counts are less than 20,000/uL and hemoglobin concentrations are less than 7g/dL or the hematocrit is less than 20%.</p>
<p>Packed RBCs will be administered in preference to whole blood if platelet counts are greater or equal to 100,000/uL with no signs of clinical bleeding.</p>
<p>Blood will be transfused into the fully sedated recipient (previously blood typed) via a blood infusion pump (syringe type) or manually via syringe and infusion set through the cephalic vein, saphenous vein, or some other peripheral vessel.</p>
<p>Animals will be visualized during and after the process for presence of a infusion reaction.</p>
<p><br />Q3) What is the typical duration of a primate study?</p>
<p>A3)  The typical duration for any cohort of a primate study is 60-90 days.</p>

Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice.

However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in any target price, or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the total final price as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant.

If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract.<br />_________________________________________________________<br />_X_52.204-7 -- System for Award Management (Jul 2013)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>This Call is issued under Technical Area #8 of the baseline BAA, BAA-RVKD-2014-0001. Proposals for any other technology area identified in the baseline BAA will not be accepted at this time.</p>
<p>Technical Area 8:&nbsp; Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR) Semiconductor Laser Devices:<br />The objective of this Technical Area is to concentrate on the design, synthesis, test, and packaging of compact mid-infrared semiconductor lasers that are capable of high brightness and wavelength agility to satisfy AF and DoD needs. Semiconductor Diode Laser (DL) technology will be pursued to generate higher brightness in the mid-IR as well as the Long Wave Infra-Red (LWIR). DL will also be used to generate high peak power in the mid-IR.&nbsp; In parallel, Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCL) will be developed in-house and lateral beam quality enhancement schemes will be applied to extract high brightness from broad-area devices. This Technical Area includes, but is not limited to:<br /><br />- Developing computational development and validation capabilities<br />- Developing, computational development and validation, experimentation, and testing of high brightness semiconductor laser hardware and semiconductor devices<br />- Researching epitaxial growth of semiconductor laser hetero-structures for mid-IR emission<br />- Developing novel beam combining techniques<br />- Conducting minimal maintenance on clean room components and molecular beam epitaxy equipment<br />- Developing photolithographic processing techniques for semiconductor laser devices<br />- Developing techniques for housing of semiconductor lasers for high thermal load operation <br />- Developing techniques for housing of system level semiconductor devices<br /><br />The specific technical objectives for this effort are provided in the COSMO Statement of Objectives (SOO) included as Attachment 1 to this Call.<br /><br /><strong>10.0 ANTICIPATED FUNDING:</strong> The anticipated funding for this effort (not per contract or award) is:<br /><br />FY18&nbsp;$1M<br />FY19&nbsp;$3M<br />FY20&nbsp;$3M<br />FY21&nbsp;$3M<br />FY22&nbsp;$3M<br />FY23&nbsp;$1M<br />TOTAL $14M</p>
<p>The above funding profile is an estimate only and not a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to Government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p><strong>11.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</strong> It is intended for this effort to be a 57 month technical effort with an additional 3 months allotted for final report preparation and administrative closeout actions.</p>
<p><strong>12.0 DELIVERABLES:</strong> The following Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) are representative of the data deliverables required for this effort. Draft CDRLs (A001-A003) are included as Attachment 3 to this Call.</p>
<p>CDRL A001: Presentation Material<br />CDRL A002: Status Report<br />CDRL A003: Scientific and Technical Report and Checklist</p>
<p><strong>13.0 OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>13.1 Security Requirements:</strong> The program security classification for this effort is SECRET. A Department of Defense (DoD) Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254, will be required during performance of the contract. A draft DD Form 254 is included as Attachment 4 to this Call.</p>
<p>13.2 Research areas may involve technology that is subject to U.S. Export Control Laws.&nbsp; Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) may submit proposals. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp or at DLIS, US/Canada Joint Certification Center, Federal Center, 74 North Washington, Battle Creek MI 49017-4312, (800) 352-3572. DFARs 252.225-7048, Export Controlled Items (JUN 2013) is incorporated into this solicitation and will be in ALL awards resulting from the Calls.</p>
<p>13.3 Due to the nature of this requirement no foreign companies at the prime or subcontractor level shall be considered for award.</p>
<p>13.4 Per DFARS 227.7103-1, DoD policy is to acquire only the technical data and the rights in that data, necessary to satisfy Government needs. In exchange for paying for development of the data, the Government expects Technical Data, Non-Commercial Software (NCS), and NCS Documentation developed entirely at Government expense to be delivered with "Unlimited Rights" or a minimum of "Government Purpose Rights" for each contract awarded in response to this announcement. Data rights offered other than "Unlimited Rights," as defined in DFARS 227.7103-5, should be identified in DFARS clause 252.227-7017 (see Section K - Representations and Certifications included as Attachment 7 to this Call) and included in the Business Section of the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>13.5 Proposal Review and Evaluation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Criteria:</strong> The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>(1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal;<br />(2) Importance to AFRL/RDL program requirements; <br />(3) Fund(s) availability</p>
<p>Once selected for possible award, price will be analyzed for Cost Realism and Price Reasonableness. Cost/Price is considered, but not an evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Adequate Price Competition is determined not to exist due to the absence of precise Government specifications and varying technical approaches proposed for R&amp;D efforts. The Government will require certified cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403-4.</p>
<p><strong>13.6 Review and Selection Process:</strong> The technical proposals will be evaluated and categorized as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>a) Highly Recommended:</strong> Well-conceived scientifically and technically sound proposal pertinent to accomplish program goals and objectives. Proposals are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Highly Recommended proposals. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>b) Selectable:</strong> Scientifically or technically sound proposals that may require additional development. Proposals are recommended for acceptance if sufficient funding is available, but at a lower priority than Highly Recommended proposals. To ensure a diversity of approaches, a Selectable proposal may be prioritized over a Highly Recommended proposal if the Selectable proposal presents a unique approach unlike any of the Highly Recommended proposals.<br /><strong>&nbsp;<br />c) Not Selectable:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs. Even if sufficient funding existed, the proposal should not be funded.</p>
<p>Note: The Government reserves the right to award some, all, or none of the proposals. When the Government elects to award only part of a proposal, the selected part may be categorized as Highly Recommended or Selectable, through the proposal as a whole may not merit such a categorization.</p>
<p><strong>13.7 Government Furnished Property (GFP):</strong> Scheduled GFP is not anticipated for this Call. However, any GFP requested for this effort shall be proposed in accordance with the baseline BAA.</p>
<p><strong>13.8 Base Support:</strong> Base Support (including necessary space and equipment in Building 416) is available for offerors and shall be proposed in accordance with the COSMO Supplemental Requirements included as Attachment 2 to this Call.</p>
<p><strong>13.9 Travel:</strong> Some travel is anticipated in support of this effort and shall be proposed and conducted in accordance with the COSMO Supplemental Requirements included as Attachment 2 to this Call.</p>
<p><strong>13.10 Section K - Representations and Certifications:</strong> The Section K - Representations and Certifications, provided as Attachment 7 to this Call, shall be completed and submitted as a part of the Business Section of the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>13.11 Organizational Conflict of Interest:</strong> In accordance with FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest, the Contracting Officer has analyzed the planned acquisition and determined that no known actual or potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) situations exist with respect to this Call. Offerors shall perform their own OCI analysis (to include potential OCI situations associated with any teammates or subcontractors). Offerors shall describe the methodology used to identify any actual or potential OCI issues. If the offeror identifies any actual or potential OCIs, the offeror shall provide an OCI mitigation plan. The contractor's mitigation plan will be determined acceptable solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer unilaterally determines any such OCI cannot be satisfactorily avoided or mitigated, the Contracting Officer may affect other remedies deemed necessary.</p>

<DESC>The&nbsp;purpose of this amendment is to do the following:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Clarify the response date and time for this RFI.&nbsp; The correct response date is 2 p.m. Central Time, 17 November 2017.&nbsp; The correct information has been updated in paragraph 5. below.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Provide notification that the request link for&nbsp;Attachment 005 - WRMS CDRL J007 - SRS v2.0 is now available.&nbsp; Note&nbsp;this is an export-controlled document.&nbsp; The attachment name is&nbsp;17WRMS.doc.<br /><br />All other information provided in the RFI remains as posted.<br />----------<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. <br /><br />1. Purpose<br /><br />Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), Product Manager, Wideband Enterprise Satellite Systems (PdM WESS), Fort Belvoir, VA, is seeking information from large and small businesses experienced in providing and supporting military satellite control in order to gage industry capacity and capability for providing operational enhancements of the Wideband Remote Monitoring Sensor (WRMS) subsystem. <br /><br />2. Background<br /><br />PdM WESS provides worldwide support for the Joint Warfighters by providing dedicated strategic satellite ground components and long haul terrestrial microwave communication systems, technical control facilities, command center upgrades, and deployed forces infrastructure. <br /><br />PM DCATS was required to stand up satellite monitoring equipment in order to support the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellite constellations, and to provide enhancements on an as-needed basis to meet emerging mission requirements. The purpose of satellite monitoring is to ensure DoD communications that take place over these satellites occur as planned and to identify/mitigate interferences. These interferences can typically be contributed to environmental disruptions (sun/rain), unauthorized access, jamming, and operator error. This not only aids in maintaining planned communications, but enables more effective management of satellite resources.<br /><br />The current strategic monitoring locations are located at the five (5) Wideband SATCOM Operations Centers (WSOCs) and the six (6) Remote Monitoring and Control Equipment (RMCE) sites located worldwide. Each WSOC has a suite of terminals to monitor the WGS and DSCS, the older constellation of DoD satellites. As the WGS fleet grew, there was a need for extended coverage for monitoring satellites, and RMCE provides the necessary coverage by allowing the WSOCs to remotely view more satellites than normally feasible.<br /><br />Satellite monitoring of WGS is done in synchronized Spectrum Information Gathering (SIG) and in-beam monitoring modes, while DSCS is done only on an in-beam monitoring mode basis. The WSOCs are connected to each other via the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) Network (WSOMSNet). This enables the WSOCs to provide backup and overlap coverage support. Coverage is required twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. Control of the satellite monitoring equipment is required to be performed by WSOC personnel via the satellite monitoring equipment's client software that functions on the WSOC workstation computers. WSOC workstation computers are also located in CONUS management facilities where SATCOM mission planners require (non-control) access for situational awareness (SA). The management facilities are part of the WSOMSNet.<br /><br />3. Required Capabilities<br /><br />WRMS requirements are as follows:<br /><br />a) Enhance Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Characterization.<br /><br />b) Power Control Management System (PCMS) Interface: Implement capability for WRMS to pull data from the field and compare to measured data from sensors in real time.<br /><br />c) Global SATCOM Configuration Control Element (GSCCE) Interface: Provide access through WRMS for all sub-channel powers measured on the spacecraft along with ability to compare channel predictions and measurements to aid with troubleshooting.<br /><br />d) World-Wide In-Beam: Provide capability to correlate worldwide in-beams and build global picture for operators.<br /><br />e) Wideband Satellite Trending Anomaly Resolution System (WSTARS) Interface: Integrate WRMS with new WSTARS architecture. <br /><br />f) Ground Mobile Forces (GMF) Reports: Upgrade WRMS with the ability to pull reports for all SATCOM users in the field.<br /><br />g) Spectral Warrior Integration: Enhance WRMS to allow analysis of Navy user spectrum and other SIPR type spectral information.<br /><br />h) ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) Integration: Continuous advancement of ePO utilization.<br /><br />i) Improved Spectrum Tools, such as waterfall display, peak power, better markers, ability to change colors of different traces, change background colors for easier screen capture/printing, etc.<br /><br />j) Incorporation of superior hardware that would result in increased performance, capabilities, and reliability. The Government is interested in both: 1) hardware/software solutions to replace the existing equipment and 2) hardware that could be integrated into the existing system without restricting functionality, serving as a supplement to the current suite of sensors. <br /><br />k) Develop releases that address all priority 1, 2, &amp; high-criticality 3 Software Change Requests (SCRs) and Software Problem Reports (SPRs). Criticality level is assigned by the Government, and priorities are defined as follows:<br /><br />&bull; Priority 1: Prevents the accomplishment of an essential capability; or, jeopardizes safety, security, or other requirement designated critical.<br /><br />&bull; Priority 2: Adversely affects the accomplishment of an essential capability and no work around solution is known; or, adversely affects technical, cost, or schedule risks to the projects or to life cycle support of the system, but a work around solution is known.<br /><br />&bull; Priority 3: Adversely affects the accomplishment of an essential capability but a work around solution is known; or, adversely affects technical, cost, or schedule risks to the project or to life cycle support of the system, but a work around solution is known. <br /><br />4.

AMRDEC is interested in demonstrating technical advances in the following technology areas: (1) Inertial Navigation Technology - Highly accurate, low cost inertial sensors enabling precision long range navigation in GPS degraded or denied environments; (2) Multi-mode Seeker Technology - Active and/or passive seekers enabling target detection, acquisition, tracking, discrimination and aim-point selection in GPS degraded or denied environments; (3) High-temperature "Seeker Friendly" Dome Materials - High temperature "seeker friendly" dome materials capable of withstanding the thermal environments resulting from extended range, high velocity flight profiles, while simultaneously maximizing RF/IR/etc. seeker performance; (4) Signature Reduction Technology - Active and/or passive means of reducing the signature of the LRF Munition in the RF, IR and other common military detection bands; (5) Warhead Technology - Kinetic and Non-Kinetic means of enabling enhanced lethality and reduced packaging envelopes (weight and/or volume); (6) Digital Datalink Technology - Communication elements enabling secure smart-weapon network integration (aimpoint coordination, arrival time synchronization, etc.); (7) Propulsion Technology - Enhanced performance propulsion systems (solid rocket motor, hybrid, gel, liquid, air-breathing, etc.) enabling extended range LRF missions; and (8) Attitude Control Technology - Enhanced performance altitude control systems (divert thrusters, canards, fins, jet vanes, etc.) enabling improved weapon system maneuverability, reduced packaging envelopes (weight and/or volume) and/or reduced power consumption. AMRDEC is interested in demonstrating the resulting technology-driven performance enhancements via sub-scale or full-scale flight test, potentially utilizing Army provided MFOM test assets.</p>
<p>All development activities related to this BAA are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. The contractor is not authorized to release any data to foreign nationals or foreign representatives without an approved export license. Prior to sub-contracting with a foreign industry the U.S. contractor will consult with the Contracting Officer and Manager, Security and Intelligence Division. Foreign subcontractors must agree that only citizens of their country or the U.S. will be allowed to perform on the contract. The U.S. contractor is responsible for complying with the regulations outlined in the International Traffic Arms and Regulation (ITAR). If foreign subcontractors are currently performing on this contract with access to U.S. Classified Military Information or controlled unclassified information, the U.S. contractor will provide the Contracting Officer and Security and Intelligence Division with a listing of the foreign subcontractors. The list will also include the country of origin, work being performed, export license number, and the name and citizenship of any third party national citizen performing on the subcontract. (AR 380-10, Foreign Disclosure Regulation)</p>
<p>The application process for this BAA includes two stages as follows: Stage 1-Prospective proposers should submit concept papers prior to the submission of a complete, more detailed proposal. Concept papers should follow the format, content and submission criteria outlined in this notice. Stage 2-Interested Offerors will be contacted within 120 days to submit full proposals.

<p>A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and Offeror's past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested.</p>
<p>Concept Paper Evaluation<br />Concept Papers will be distributed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to the designated Government Subject Matter Expert (SME) team for review and evaluation weekly. Every 15 days, the SME team chairperson will provide the COR with a numerical rating and summary of all concept papers received in the SME's designated Technology Focus Area during the 15 day evaluation period. At the end of 30 days, if a concept paper is selected for a Request for Proposal (RFP), the SME team chairperson will provide a detailed summary of all evaluations completed during the 30 days prior to the request and a justification for selecting that particular concept paper for RFP. The COR will be responsible for sending the evaluation to the AMRDEC Acquisition Office every 60 days, or before if a RFP is required. Acquisition has 120 days to provide a response (negative/ RFP) to the contractor. Concept papers will be evaluated using the following criteria: Concept Papers will be reviewed by AMRDEC personnel and their support contractors to ensure that the Offeror meets the specified experience and capability requirements, and that the submitted concept falls within the stated objectives of the BAA. Concept papers that fail to satisfy either criteria will not be formally evaluated. Selected Concept Papers will be formally evaluated by AMRDEC personnel and their support contractors. AMRDEC will base the technical merit evaluation on the contractor's demonstrated capability and competence in categories that include: 1) Understanding and insight into the LRF mission role within Army combat doctrine; 2) Understanding and insight into the emerging threats driving the need for LRF performance improvements; 3) Understanding and insight into current state-of-the -art and emerging/near-term long-range missile system technologies; 4) Demonstrated experience in the development, delivery, integration and flight demonstrating new missile system technologies; and 5) Perceived value to AMRDEC of the proposed capability enhancements to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Concept Paper Evaluation Scoring<br />The following numerical ratings will be applied to the evaluation criteria:</p>
<p>- Demonstrated understanding of the evolving LRF Mission Requirements and emerging Threats (25 points) <br />- Demonstrated understanding of state-of-the-art and emerging/near-term long range missile system technologies (25 points)<br />- Proposed technology development, integration and flight demonstration of performance enhancement technologies within Army LRF missiles (25 points)<br />- Demonstrated missile system technology development and transfer experience (15 points)<br />- Cost reasonableness (10 points)</p>
<p>The overall ratings for combined criteria for concept papers is as follows: Excellent (80+), Good (79-59), Unsatisfactory (&lt;59). Concept papers receiving an overall rating of less than 80 will not be considered for a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance our understanding of the Offeror's submittal as part of the Evaluation process. If there is sufficient interest within the Government, a formal proposal will be requested from the Offeror. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. The Contracting Office will notify Offerors within 120 days as to whether or not their concept paper was selected for formal proposal. Concept papers not selected for formal proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE CONCEPT PAPER RESPONSES RECEIVED.</p>
<p>All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Office point of contact (POC): Ms. Candace S. Tucker, via e-mail at candace.s.tucker.civ@mail.mil, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Janet Childers, via e-mail at janet.childers@us.army.mil. Facsimile concept paper submissions are not authorized under this announcement. Concept Papers shall contain UNCLASSIFIED data only. Should an Offeror have need to submit a CLASSIFIED Concept Paper Addendum, they shall coordinate with AMRDEC prior to the submittal deadline to ensure proper handling of the Addendum. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS AN EXPRESSION OF INTEREST ONLY AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE ANY AWARD OR TO PAY FOR ANY RESPONSE PREPARATION COSTS. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the Offeror in determining how or whether to submit a full BAA proposal.</p>
<p>Proposals.<br />In Stage 2 of the BAA application process, the interested Offerors will be contacted within 120 days to submit full proposals. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office after the evaluation of concept papers, as described above. THE CONTRACTING OFFICE WILL ASK ONLY THOSE OFFERORS WITH PROMISING CONCEPT PAPERS TO SUBMIT FULL TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS. AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts are expected to be awarded, with the period of performance for each IDIQ contract estimated to be no less than 12 months and to not exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. The Proposal shall adhere to the following format: 1) File Type: Microsoft Word (.docx); 2) Page Size: 8&frac12; x 11 inches, 1 inch Margins, single-spaced; 3) Font: Arial, 12 point (text); Arial, 10 point (captions &amp; tables); 4) Page Count: No more than thirty (30) pages, not including a cover page, table of contents, definitions and references. Proposals exceeding the pages limit will not be evaluated. Pages shall be numbered consecutively. Proprietary material should be clearly marked. The statement "Releasable to Government Agencies and their supporting Contractors for Review Only" must accompany any proprietary submission. Proposals shall contain UNCLASSIFIED data only. Should an Offeror have need to submit a CLASSIFIED Proposal Addendum, they shall coordinate with AMRDEC prior to the submittal deadline to ensure proper handling of the Addendum. The CLASSIFIED Proposal Addendum shall adhere to the same formatting requirements as the parent Proposal and does count towards the Proposal page limit.</p>
<p>Content.<br />The Government will provide SELECTED Offerors with proposal content requirements. Generally, proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Performance Work Statement (PWS): The PWS should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed. The PWS should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the advancement of tactical missile propulsion technology. The PWS should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables; (2) One page resumes of the Offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important; (3) The type of support, if any, the Offeror requests of the AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by Offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, Offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment; (4) A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment; (5) A brief description of your organization; (6) The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and understanding of the proposal; (7) A listing of current similar R&amp;D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer &amp; technical) shall be included. The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by element of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation. Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project. For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort; (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit; (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies; (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation. Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation; (5) Other direct costs; (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified; (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional); (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project; (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc.). Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontracting goals for small businesses are thirty-five (35%) percent. Subcontracting goals for small disadvantage businesses, and women-owned small businesses are five (5%) percent. Subcontracting goals for HUBZone small businesses, for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and Historically Black Colleges &amp; University/Minority Institutions (HBCUs/MIs) are three (3%) percent. Pursuant to FAR 19.708, all formal proposals over $550,000 that are not submitted by a small business concern will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan with their formal proposal. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted.</p>
<p>Potential Deliverables.<br />The following is a list of possible Contract Data Requirements that might be required when submitting a proposal. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1) DI-ADMN-81373, Presentational Material, as required; 2) DI-ADMN-81505, Report, Record of Meeting/Minutes, as required; 3) DI-MGMT-80004A, Management Plan, as required; 4) DI-MGMT-80227, Contractor's Progress, Status and Management Report, as required; 5) DI-MISC-80508B, Technical Report - Study/Services (Final), as required; 6) DI-MISC-80508B, Technical Report - Study/Services (Interim), as required; 7) DI-NDTI-80809B, Test/Inspection Report, as required; 8) DI-QCIC-80553A, Acceptance Test Plan, as required; 9) DI-SESS-81001E, Conceptual Design Drawings/Models, as required; 10) DI-SESS-81002F, Developmental Design Drawings/Models &amp; Associated Lists, as required; 11) DI-SESS-81248B, Interface Control Document DI-SESS-81704, Test Plans/Test Procedures, as required; 12) US Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirements, as required.</p>
<p>Long term proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. The frequency and type of data item will vary due to research topic and proposal content.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that contract awards resulting from this BAA will be in the form of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts with total period of performance estimated to be up to 48 months, including time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. For planning purposes, individual awards are anticipated from $1.0M up to $135M, with the combined total of all BAA awards not to exceed $148M. Multiple awards are possible. The Government reserves the right to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with Offerors prior to contract award if the technical monitor determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.</p>
<p>Proposal Evaluation Criteria.<br />Award consideration will be based on technical, cost, and the contractor's past performance. AMRDEC will base the Technical Evaluation on the contractor's proposal to include the following criteria: 1) demonstrated understanding of LRF mission within Army combat doctrine and emerging threats to be engaged; 2) demonstrated understanding and experience in advanced emerging technologies required for long range missile systems; 3) proposed innovative concepts and missile technology enhancements supported by engineering analysis, integration and test activities required to successfully conduct a flight demonstration; 4) proposed resources (equipment, facilities, personnel) and experience to perform the proposed fabrication, integration and test effort and transition developed technologies; and 5) potential contribution to AMRDEC's Long Range Fires mission.</p>
<p>The Cost Evaluation on contractor's proposal will be based on the following criteria: 1) Cost reasonableness of the contractor's cost proposal will be evaluated. Cost reasonableness means a fair and reasonable price; i.e., the price that a prudent businessperson would pay for an item or service under competitive market conditions, given a reasonable knowledge of the marketplace. Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the various elements of the other parts of the proposal; 2) Finally, the government will assess the risk associated with the contractor's cost proposal.</p>
<p>The Past Performance Evaluation will be based on demonstrated successful execution of past weapon system definition, development, and test efforts. Elements to be evaluated include the following criteria: 1) relevancy of cited programs; 2) recency of cited programs: 3) successful satisfaction of SOW objectives in cited programs; 4) adherence to development and delivery schedules in cited programs; and 5) adherence to program budgets in cited programs.</p>
<p>Proposal Evaluation Scoring<br />The following numerical ratings will be applied to the evaluation criteria: <br />Technical 60%<br />- Understanding LRF mission and emerging threats (10%)<br />- Understanding and experience in advanced technologies (10%)<br />- Proposed demonstration program supported by engineering and test (20%)<br />- Proposed resources and experience to perform proposed program (10%)<br />- Potential contribution to AMRDEC's Long Range Fires mission/Importance to Agency Programs (10%)<br />Cost: 20%<br />- Cost Reasonableness (10%)<br />- Cost Risk (10%)<br />Past Performance: 20%<br />- Relevancy (10%)<br />- Recency (10%)</p>
<p>The overall ratings for combined criteria for proposals is as follows: Excellent (80+), Good (79-59), Unsatisfactory (&lt;59). Proposals receiving an overall rating of less than 80 will not be considered for a contract award.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance our understanding of the Offeror's submittal as part of the Evaluation process. In accordance with the guidelines described in FAR 15.605 and 35.008, primary emphasis in the evaluation will be given to the Technical assessment, which is deemed significantly more important than the Cost assessment.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE PROPOSAL RESPONSES RECEIVED.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with Offerors prior to contract award if the technical monitor determines them to be necessary.</p>

<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. THIS PROJECT IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), ONE PHASE DESIGN-BID-BUILD SOURCE SELECTION SOLICITATION. <br /><br />The Advanced Munitions Technology Complex (AMTC) project includes construction of eight primary facilities for development of nano energetic/explosive technologies and the development, integration, rapid prototyping, and fielding of advance munitions. The buildings incorporate reinforced concrete construction and concrete masonry units (CMU) with a combination of CMU split face veneer, metal panel system, pre-cast panels, and translucent fiberglass panel system in clearstory applications for the exterior of the facility; superflat floors; flat roof systems consisting of white PVC membrane over tapered insulation and a concrete deck; and earth berm (with shotcrete top slab) covered operational and storage bunkers. The design incorporates explosives safety, anti-terrorism force protection (AT/FP) physical security, and life safety requirements, as well acoustic and vibration mitigation techniques. Mitigation of explosive effects, including blast, thermal and fragment hazards, is provided with hardened reinforced concrete framing and steel fragment shields. Blast doors include single-swing to sliding doors, for intentional detonation or accidental detonation, to meet blast loading, response criteria, minimum fragment shield thickness, and seal requirements.
<p>LEED Silver certification is required for the AMTC campus with the objective to reduce total ownership cost through long-term energy performance, conservation of potable water and resources, reduced maintenance and operating costs, and a healthy and productive work environment. Project site work includes clearing, cut/fill, grading, security fence, storm water drainage, utilities, and pavements. Mechanical systems include individual chiller plants, condensing type, gas-fired boilers, single duct variable air volume air handling units, with direct digital control (DDC) system. Plumbing systems include domestic hot and cold water, natural gas, sanitary sewer, industrial waste, storm, compressed air, purge gas generator system, ODCA (oxygen depleted compressed air) gas generator system, vacuum systems, as well as process cooling water chillers, split DX systems, and low pressure steam for process heating and humidification. Electrical systems include power, lighting, communication/Data, audio visual, intrusion detection system, access control system, and lightning protection. Fire protection systems include new fire water distribution system (with central fire pump house), fire alarm with mass notification (including strobes, beacons, horns, and audible notification) and fire sprinkler system (wet sprinkler and ultra-high-speed deluge systems).</p>

<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. THIS PROJECT IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), ONE PHASE DESIGN-BID-BUILD SOURCE SELECTION SOLICITATION. <br /><br />The Advanced Munitions Technology Complex (AMTC) project includes construction of eight primary facilities for development of nano energetic/explosive technologies and the development, integration, rapid prototyping, and fielding of advance munitions.

The OEM has the ability to provide remote service to the equipment and are approved by Clinical Engineering.



A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition. The proprietary data is:
  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting. Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)    Philips is the manufacturer of the equipment to be serviced and has limited sole proprietary of the required services. The services do have to be performed by a certified Philips technician. Philips does
not authorize third parties to subcontract their services. This equipment is extremely specialized and highly technical in nature and should only be performed by individuals affiliated with Philips. Any equipment other than OEM shall not be used on the equipment because it may pose unnecessary risk
to patient care.  






These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.

Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 2: Request for Limited Sources Justification Format >$150K

Revision 05 Date: 05/02/2016



The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing. Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
All parts associated with the equipment to be serviced must be OEM or certified by the manufacturer.


The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures.



An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays.





DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:
$997,948.83
$112,906.83
$997,948.83






The National Acquisition Center has already been determined fair and reasonable. Procurement is consistent with prior year pricing at  per year referencing Task Order VA241-16-F-2070. Philips has provided the government with a comparable amount for FY17 with additional components making up the difference.



DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research was done to ensure that there are no SDVOSB' or VOSB's capable of performing these services. This research was done by posting a RFI on FBO. Further market was not done because a memo dated August 23,2016 reinstated the NAC as a Mandatory Source. Market Conditions have not
changed when considering risk as it relates to third party services.  


ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
Far 8.405-6 {B} Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized is the Basis of my minimum requirement in order to be certified by ACR and other regulating agencies  findings.

A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The Ageny shall do a risk analysis to determine risk considering going to other than OEM. The equipment is highly technical and the  interested parties must  be  able  to self  perform  a
measurable  amount  of  the  service.  

REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.
