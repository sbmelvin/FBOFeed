<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, hereby gives notice of their intent to award a contract to Prosci Inc., 5042 Technology Pkwy Suite 500 Fort Collins, CO 80528, on a sole source basis utilizing FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition, procedures in accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller has a requirement to procure the Prosci 3-day Change Management Training/Certification course. OCC has implemented a Decision Making and Execution Framework and Change Management practices to improve its speed and effectiveness of implementing decisions. To improve capacity, OCC needs enterprise-wide change capability and is therefore implementing an Enterprise Change Management (ECM) initiative to reduce the risk associated with change.</p>
<p>OCC has been using Proci's change management approach and finding that it fits OCC's structure, processes, and culture because it is researched-based, scalable, digestible, and role-based. Given this ad hoc use, OCC recognizes that the full benefit will not be realized without an enterprise approach. To fulfill this role, each embedded change management resource will need to learn the Prosci Change Management methodology and change management competencies.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received in writing within three days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide the services outlined in this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

This is the follow-on solicitation to our current standing solicitation, SPM2DH-11-R-0011, which closes on August 15, 2016. <br />&nbsp;<br />DLA Troop Support, in an effort to improve medical supply support to our customers, developed the Electronic Catalog (ECAT) System. The ECAT System allows DLA Troop Support customers (CONUS AND OCONUS) to review and compare contractor electronic catalogs with the ultimate goal of placing on-line orders to the contractor of their choice. Customers are currently using the ECAT System to order medical equipment and related supplies.
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to establish new and follow-on Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contracts in accordance with the ECAT multi-award program complying with FAR Part 16. Subsequent orders will be placed consistent with FAR 8.4. The solicitation will be a standing solicitation, which will remain in effect for 5 years from the solicitation issue date. Awards will be made to all offerors determined responsible, who take no exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, and whose prices can be determined fair and reasonable. This solicitation will result in multiple long term contracts, each with a base term of 5 years. DLA Troop Support will be awarding each contract under the Medical Equipment ECAT Program and will also retain all contract administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are soliciting for Medical Equipment, maintenance of Medical Equipment (with or without the equipment), and/or spare parts of Medical Equipment (with or without the equipment).

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to extend the current contract (DTFACT-12-D-00018) with Lexmark International Inc. of Lexington KY.  This extension and associated contract ceiling increase will allow for the continued purchase of printers and multi-function devices (MFD), and related support services for a period of twelve (12) months.  The purpose of this extension is to allow for sufficient time for the FAA to complete the planned competition for a new contract for this requirement.  The FAA is currently in the pre-solicitation planning stages for this new follow-on procurement and a market survey has previously been posted for it under DTFACT-17-R-00011.

Lexmark is the current provider under contract DTFAWA-12-D-00018. This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the Strategic Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program.  This contract provides simplified purchasing of printing equipment for the FAAâ€™s CONUS and OCONUS locations.
This is a sole source requirement to Lexmark as they are the only current provider of the above products under the FAA mandatory source SAVES contract. 

Accordingly, a competitive solicitation is not available for this immediate requirement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement.

The RFQ should be posted on or before 23 February 2018.

<p>ATTENTION small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions</p>
<p>1. Is your firm registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), formally known as Central Contractor Registration (CCR)? In accordance with federal regulations, all contractors doing business with the federal government must be registered in the SAM database.</p>
<p>2. Describe briefly the capabilities of the nature of the services you provide.</p>
<p>3. Describe your company's past experience on previous with similar services. Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>4. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>5. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, submit your responses to jessica.stamper.2@us.af.mil E-mail responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM EST on 31 Jan 2018.</p>
<p>All responses must be UNCLASSIFIED; no classified material will be accepted or considered with this Sources Sought Synopsis. The response to Part I. Business Information should be single spaced, 12pt font. The response to Part II. Capabilities should be limited to no more than 10 pages (8.5x11 inches), single spaced, 12pt font. In addition, identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. The Air Force will handle proprietary items in accordance with FAR 2.101 and 3.104.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request For Concept Papers On Exoskeleton Technologies For The Warfighter
<SOLNBR>W911QY-15-R-0016-C16FutureWarrierTech
<RESPDATE>031218
<CONTACT>Kimberly B. Pumyea, Phone 5082335167, Email kimberly.b.pumyea.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Synopsis: <br />The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), in collaboration with the Department of Defense (DoD) Services, are conducting a Request for Information (RFI) for Concept (White) Papers on Exoskeletons for Warfighter applications thru the United States Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC). This is not a Request for Proposal.
<p>The US Warfighter, whether he or she is in a dismounted infantry or a mission support unit, is physically overburdened. This increases fatigue, reduces movement and maneuver, and increases the likelihood of acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries, ultimately weakening mission effectiveness and readiness. Exoskeletons, designed to improve strength, endurance, and ergonomics while maintaining user safety and reducing physical injury risk during various load tasks, have been viewed by the DoD Services as a promising approach to enable Warfighters to maintain peak performance longer. For example, the Army views "exoskeletons" as a capability to enable "Soldier Lethality", which is among the Army's top six Modernization Priorities.</p>
<p>The DoD seeks innovative exoskeleton approaches to improve Warfighter performance during mobility over uneven terrain, ergonomically challenging load tasks (awkward postures, long duration overhead work), heavy lifting, other repetitive logistics and sustainment load tasks. Effective exoskeleton systems demonstrate the principles of user safety, comfort, ease of use, integration with user clothing and individual mission equipment, energy efficiency to enable long operating durations (and in some cases, fully passive systems), and low system costs. A variety of exoskeleton systems are expected to be needed to meet DoD needs, including, but not limited to, the following types: <br />1. Infantry - High mobility type capabilities focused on mobility augmentation, endurance augmentation, and injury risk reduction. Enhances the Warfighters' ability to "Shoot, Move, Communicate, Protect, and Sustain" by allowing Warfighters to perform tasks and reach their destination faster with greater lethality, efficiency, and with greater physical and cognitive reserves throughout a mission.</p>
<p>2. Logistics/sustainment/mission support - Low or medium mobility type capabilities focused on strength and productivity augmentation and injury risk reduction during lifting, loading, unloading, and transporting tasks. May require compatibility with tools or other common DoD Service load interfaces.<br />a. Light Tasks - Assists lightweight but ergonomically challenging tasks.<br />b. Medium Lift and Carry - Makes individual Warfighter lifting tasks safer and more effective.<br />c. Heavy Lift and Carry - Exoskeleton enables multi-person load handling tasks to be carried out with a single person (i.e. human forklift) safely. Serves as a force multiplier, creating a smaller force with greater capabilities.</p>
<p>3. Specialized Capability Platform - Medium mobility type capabilities to enable and reduce the physical work effort of specific application sets (e.g. Situational Awareness, Lethality, Explosive Ordnance Disposal and other forms of up-armor, and chemical &amp; biological protection).</p>
<p>Specific Warfighter tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: <br />A. Conduct tactical movement with approach march load of 99-136 lbs<br />B. While wearing fighting load (75-90 lbs) walk in crouched posture, climbing stairs and crawling in a confined space <br />C. While wearing fighting load (75-90 lbs) conduct bounding rushes (start prone, 3-5 second dash, back down to prone)<br />D. Conduct up-armored door breach and close quarter battle maneuvers <br />E. Conduct unit resupply of Logistics Package (LOGPAC) by loading and unloading items from Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV)<br />F. Conduct aircraft and/or vehicle maintenance tasks <br />G. Harden / improve a fighting position <br />H. Lift and transport (e.g. fireman's carry) 270 lb casualty a distance of 45 ft<br />I. Pry / remove heavy (100+ lb) obstructions to gain access to pinned-down 270 lb casualty and drag a 270 lb casualty a distance of 45 ft to casualty collection point.</p>
<p>Exoskeletons proposed must align with at least 1 of the 5 exoskeleton system types above (1, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 3), outline which of the 9 tasks Warfighter tasks above are achievable, be at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of "4" (TRL Descriptions: https://www.acq.osd.mil/chieftechnologist/publications/docs/TRA2011.pdf, and provide a self-assessment of TRL with supporting data. In addition, proposers shall outline system availability for a demonstration in the late summer 2018 timeframe. Proposed systems will also be compared with the conventional solutions in the field and those in development to determine their technical and operational viability.</p>
<p>All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation Number W911QY-15-R-0016, under topic # C16- Future Warrior Technology Integration, which can be found at http://www3.natick.army.mil/(S(hy4ind3xtp3qrnv15nlc4dr1))/NSRDEC-Broad-Agency-Announcement.aspx. Offerors shall submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA. Instructions for the submission of concept papers are contained in BAA Topic # C16. "Future Warrior Technology Integration." Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI. Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government, and will not be returned to the submitter.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted by 5 PM EST on March 12, 2018, and may be sent via email to gregory.b.kanagaki.civ@mail.mil or by regular mail to US Army RDECOM, Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, SPOD (ATTN: Greg Kanagaki), General Greene Avenue, Natick, MA, 01760.

<SUBJECT>Apache Targeting and Pilotage Sensor Upgrade RFI
<SOLNBR>W52P1J18XXXX1
<RESPDATE>022018
<ARCHDATE>03202018
<CONTACT>Brandon M. Garnica, Phone 3097823650, Email brandon.m.garnica.civ@mail.mil - Ashley N. Fahrenkrug, Contracting Officer, Phone 3097828747, Email ashley.n.fahrenkrug.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /> PM APACHE - SENSORS PRODUCT OFFICE
<p>1.0 SCOPE<br /> This RFI, issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e), is issued for the purpose of preliminary planning for potential acquisition of new targeting and pilotage sensor systems and is not a Request for Proposal. The United States Government (USG) does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information to determine what sensor systems exist or are planned, the state of the art of technology and the availability of technical data for planning purposes. A response to this notice is not an offer and no offer can be accepted by the USG to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE<br /> The purpose of this RFI is to facilitate continued market research on the state of technology which could be incorporated into a potential materiel solution for replacements of the targeting and/or pilotage sensor systems on the AH64 Apache Attack Helicopter, and related life cycle costs to do so. Respondents may reply to either the targeting or pilotage requirement, or both. Information provided by Industry will be used to assess the current state of technology and whether the technology can mitigate performance capability gaps and holistically resolve existing obsolescence challenges. The results of the assessment will be used to define and recommend a potential materiel solution option, requiring a minimal engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) program.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI, which will be used to inform/refine the performance specifications used in any future RFP, should provide an overview of the candidate technology solution(s) including optical architecture (spectral paths, switching optics, fore-optics, etc.), sensors (FPA material, pixel pitch and format, SNR performance, etc.), servo stabilization (inner gimbal, fast steering mirrors, etc.), and future growth potential after initial deployment. This overview should describe whether the candidate solution(s) meets the threshold targeting and pilotage performance requirements, as defined in Appendix A, and if not, how the baseline candidate can be modified to meet these requirements with a minimal EMD program. Additionally, the responses should address how the candidate system performs relative to the stated objective requirement. In instances where the objective requirement is stated as &quot;Contractor Furnished Information&quot;, contractors are requested to provide upper estimates on the technology's capability. Estimates on range performance should be supported by modeling; the details of which (i.e. the &lsquo;input deck') shall be provided so that the USG can independently assess the results using NV-IPM.</p>
<p>To support the government's efforts to estimate the total life cycle cost for replacing Apache pilotage and/or targeting systems, contractors are requested to provide budgetary estimates for an EMD program sufficient to complete qualification, and the cumulative average unit production costs (CAUPC) costs for 762 systems plus spares to support a 2-level maintenance concept. Additionally, a breakout of cumulative average unit production costs and mean time between failure (MTBF) rates for each line replaceable module (LRM) are requested. Responses should also address any planned IR&amp;D expenditures which would offset EMD expenses.</p>
<p>The requested information is for internal planning purposes only and will not be publicly released outside the USG. It is the intent of the USG that industry responses to this RFI will be considered with respect to the development of a future RFP, should a decision be made to proceed.</p>
<p>The USG intends to engage Industry on their RFI submittals, via an Industry Day (tentatively scheduled for late 2nd quarter FY2018) or other face to face engagements as determined by the USG. The intent of these engagements is to conduct market research and specifically for respondents to discuss select technologies described in their RFI response, provide insights as to the challenges they face in developing sensor technologies to meet Army requirements, and the risks associated with developing an executable sensor upgrade program.</p>
<p>3.0 RESPONDENT RESPONSIBILITIES<br /> Respondents are advised that the USG will not pay for any information, demonstration, discussions or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. Further, all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the respondent.</p>
<p>4.0 FUTURE ACQUISITION PLANS<br /> There is no guarantee that the PM Apache Sensor Upgrade program will advance to an acquisition phase based upon the results of the information provided by industry, nor is there any guarantee the USG will pursue sensor demonstrations in the future. No determination of a path forward has been made at this time.</p>
<p>5.0 RESPONDENT INSTRUCTIONS<br /> Respondents are requested to address their responses in accordance with Appendix A. It should be noted that life cycle cost projections are as critical to forming the RFP as are the system capabilities and technology readiness assessment. All final responses should be submitted to the address below no later than 20 February 2018. <br /> USG support contractors for the following companies will assist in the review of any data provided by respondents to the RFI:</p>
<p>*Iron Mountain<br /> *Torch <br /> *Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Camber Corporation)<br /> *MTS<br /> *University of Alabama-Huntsville</p>
<p>A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) has been signed by the above support contractors with the USG that precludes them from disclosing any data outside of the USG. Accordingly, respondents are asked to provide concurrence in their submissions that the data submitted may be reviewed by the above listed PM Apache and Aviation Engineering Directorate contract support employees. All information will be handled by PM Apache as procurement sensitive information subject to the protections, restrictions and requirements set forth in FAR 3.104.</p>
<p>Proprietary information should be clearly marked. No classified documents shall be included in your response. Please be advised all information submitted in response to the RFI becomes the property of the USG and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Electronic responses, IAW Appendix A, should be submitted. There is no page limit for RFI responses. Please provide your firm/company's name and address, and point of contact with telephone number and email address. Hard copy responses are not allowed, only electronic responses will be accepted. Please submit responses to Mr. Brandon Garnica at brandon.m.garnica.civ@mail.mil, (309) 782-3650 and Ms. Ashley Fahrenkrug at ashley.n.fahrenkrug.civ@mail.mil, (309) 782-8747, no later than 20 February 2018.</p>

<CONTACT>Jeffrey Brown, Phone 2026933159, Email brown.jeffrey@dol.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (DOL/ETA) is seeking qualified contractors that can provide actuarial support for the Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) in the areas of state unemployment insurance (UI) trust fund forecasting and benefit cost estimating, technical assistance to states in managing profiling models, budget and legislative estimating, budget formulation, data analysis related to UI program performance, and in the production of statistical reports. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. Include whether or not you are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small business; woman-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p>The objective of this project is to provide the OUI needed support in carrying out its responsibilities. The contractor for this project would assist the OUI in two major areas.</p>
<p>The first major area is technical assistance to State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). A large part of this technical assistance is in the area of benefit financing. Since the 1970s, trust fund solvency has been an ongoing concern in the UI system. In theory, UI tax systems are designed to build up reserves in good economic times in order to pay benefits when unemployment is high. In practice, many states do not maintain adequate reserves and some are forced to borrow from the Federal loan fund, even in relatively mild recessions, to pay UI benefits. During the most recent recession and its aftermath, thirty-six states were forced to borrow. Two states still have outstanding Title XII advances from the Federal Unemployment Account, while four additional states have outstanding bonds issued on the private market as of November 2017. At the end of FY 2017, it was estimated that 55% of states remained below the federally recommended minimum solvency level, while 23% remained below half of that minimum solvency level.</p>
<p>The ongoing solvency concerns of the UI system make it important for the DFAS to be active in this area. A key activity is to make available to the SWAs a trust fund simulation model called the Benefit Financing Model (BFM). This model is maintained and supported in the National Office by the DFAS and is currently used by about one-third of the states. Currently, DFAS is developing a more user friendly Excel-based version of the model to make it easier to operate, maintain, and implement in new states. The DFAS also works closely with states that request assistance in modifying or designing new tax structures, either with or without use of the BFM. Another aspect of benefit financing technical assistance to states is the presentation of periodic Benefit Financing Seminars to introduce state actuarial staff to benefit financing concepts and trust fund forecasting techniques.</p>
<p>A second type of technical assistance is to assist states in the development and maintenance of profiling models. All states are required to profile their UI claimants in order to identify potential UI exhaustees and provide them reemployment services early in their UI spells through the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA) program. This is most often accomplished through the use of a statistical model, which uses various claimant characteristics to predict the probability of benefit exhaustion. When requested, DFAS works closely with states to develop and/or update these models through guidance, one-on-one training and, when requested, direct modeling.</p>
<p>A third type of technical assistance is the provision of training seminars in quantitative methods and profiling methods for state staff. The quantitative methods training gives state staff information, instruction and hands-on experience in basic regression and forecasting techniques that are applicable to UI trust fund forecasting and analysis. Similarly, the profiling methods training gives state staff information and experience in the specific statistical procedures used in developing profiling models while also providing them with the basic resources necessary to develop their own state models.</p>
<p>The second major area in which the contractor will assist the OUI is in its role at the national level. This role includes making estimates and doing analyses for budget and legislative purposes, monitoring state and Federal trust fund account activity and solvency, providing data analysis in support of DOL performance goals and in support of OUI initiatives, forecasting state workloads to allocate administrative funds, compiling and analyzing various UI indicators, and disseminating data to the public.</p>
<p>At least twice a year, the DFAS is responsible for updating all estimates and projections of UI benefit outlays, revenues, workloads, and administrative outlays in conjunction with the Federal budget process. The DFAS is also responsible for making estimates of the cost and revenue impact of proposed law changes being considered by the Congress or the Administration. To make these estimates and projections, the DFAS employs a number of computer models and spreadsheets, ranging from simple to complex. These models require continual monitoring, maintenance, and enhancements.</p>
<p>Another area of work involves compiling and publishing data and doing data analysis related to various UI indicators, including solvency measures, recipiency rates and wage replacement rates that may be used to establish performance measures and goals. The DFAS is responsible for developing, calculating and analyzing measures of trust fund adequacy such as the Average High Cost Multiple. The DFAS is also responsible for estimating the amount of Federal UI tax collections (as authorized by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA)) by state and compiling, publishing and analyzing comparisons of collections to amounts returned to states.</p>
<p>Additionally the DFAS is responsible for producing and documenting various estimates and projections to be used in the annual and quarterly Department of Labor Financial Statements. These include estimating disbursements, estimating accrued benefit payments, and simulating the impact of various recession scenarios on balances in the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF).</p>
<p>The DPM is responsible for additional data analysis and the development of implementation plans for a number of national strategies for state programs, which were designed to address major root causes of UI improper payments. These strategies involve the review, use, and possible modification of the Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) statistical survey program used to determine the accuracy of paid and denied claims in the three major UI program areas: State UI, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE), and Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX).</p>
<p>PROJECT TASKS</p>
<p>Budget and Legislative Analysis</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall maintain, monitor and improve computer models used to make Federal budget and legislative estimates. The contractor will have responsibility for the revenue and state loan model, which makes state-by-state projections of tax rates, fund balances, loans, etc. The contractor will also have responsibility for the STUBEN regular benefits model and the Extended Benefits (EB) model. The contractor shall use these models to make budget and legislative estimates as required. Model equations must be reviewed and updated annually. The contractor shall review and assess alternative techniques, methodologies, and model platforms for modeling and projecting key UI program variables. All model changes must be documented. For all models, standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be created and maintained.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall produce actuarial calculations on a monthly and quarterly basis for the DOL financial statements. These include estimated UTF disbursements for all programs, due and payable accruals for all programs, and existing claims accruals for Federal UI programs. The contractor shall also produce information annually for the Required Supplemental Information attachment to the financial statements, including 10-year projections of UTF balances under various economic scenarios and an assessment of state trust fund solvency. The contractor shall develop and maintain SOPs to existing methodologies and projection procedures as required, and ensure full documentation of all revisions.</p>
<p>Profiling Model Technical Assistance</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall assist DFAS in providing technical assistance and support to states and Regional Offices in developing, implementing, maintaining, updating and reviewing statistical models or characteristic screening systems for identifying claimants likely to exhaust benefits. Technical assistance will be performed either via telephone, email, or on-site, as determined by the COR. Technical assistance will include: providing general guidance to state staff, identifying and analyzing state data sources and elements, determining model specifications and estimating model coefficients. All model development materials and final documentation shall be provided to both the state and Federal staff for future reference. These tasks will be done either in coordination with state staff, for integrating the econometric model into existing UI software systems, or with Regional Office staff in reviewing and assessing state profiling systems. Additionally, the contractor shall work with DFAS staff to develop modeling and training materials such as stock modeling scripts and training videos, to provide directly to state staff.</p>
<p>Trust Fund Forecasting Technical Assistance</p>
<p>4. As needed, the contractor shall work with DFAS staff to provide support to SWAs in the task of forecasting UI trust fund balances using the BFM. This task entails developing and maintaining various UI-related regression equations used in the simulation models, modeling new state UI laws, collecting and setting up numerous input data files, running simulations under various economic scenarios, and providing technical support to state users.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall assist in the continued development and maintenance of a new Excel version of the BFM. The contractor shall work with DFAS staff to further develop this model by implementing state projection equations, and producing user interface screens, all within the existing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) framework. The contractor shall develop and maintain SOP's for updating procedures and full model documentation including user instructions and model operation.</p>
<p>In-Person Training Seminars - Technical Assistance</p>
<p>6. The contractor may produce either a single one-week Benefit Financing Seminar or a single one-week Profiling Methods Seminar per year, as determined by the COR, during the project period, for approximately thirty participants from SWAs. For each seminar, the contractor shall provide all training materials and supplies and will coordinate logistics. Contract staff shall prepare presentations jointly with Federal staff. The COR will determine seminar dates and specific course content. Topics for each seminar will include the following:</p>
<p>a. Benefit Financing Seminar: UI cost and revenue forecasting, UI tax structures, experience rating, measuring trust fund solvency, Title XII loans, and basic statistical methods. Hands-on use of the BFM will be emphasized.</p>
<p>b. Profiling Methods Seminar: overview of RESEA and worker profiling guidelines, overview of potential model types and statistical methods, and hands-on overview of the modeling process including data prep, analysis, transformations, model development and interpretation, and model validation. Hands-on instruction will be provided using a standard statistical package as determined by the COR.</p>
<p>Reports</p>
<p>7. The contractor shall prepare a quarterly publication, the UI Data Summary, which provides a detailed comparison of the status of states with respect to unemployment rates, benefit payment activities, revenues, and trust fund reserves. The publication shall be made available both in hard copy and on the OUI website. The contractor shall maintain and document routines used to extract data, manipulate data, and produce the report. The contractor shall respond to requests for data related to this report or other UI data from researchers, Congressional staff, etc.</p>

<DESC>This project restores the 3,600 square foot historic Scotty's Castle Visitor Center, accessible parking, and pedestrian walkways, which have been closed to the public since a massive flash flood in 2015 damaged them extensively. This project restores flood damage to the interior and exterior of the historic Garage/Long Shed/Bunkhouse: a structure consisting of three connected buildings, which are contributing features of the Death Valley Scotty Historic District. The Visitor Center occupies the historic Garage. This project includes reconstruction of one exterior wall, replacement of studs damaged by termites, replacement of sheet rock and interior finishes, replacement of damaged doors and windows, restoration of historic redwood doors, removal of damaged asbestos floor tiles, replacement of floor coverings, replacement of the roof, installing a fire suppression system, repairing electrical systems, and replacing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system in the Visitor Center portion of the structure. This project shall repair approximately 72,000 square feet of pedestrian plaza and walkways. The pedestrian walkways at Scotty's Castle shall be upgraded to provide ABAAS accessible routes for visitors to enter the Visitor Center and tours of Scotty's Castle with minimal visual impact on the cultural landscape. The walkways were in poor condition before the flood, and are completely unusable after the flood damaged and removed sections of the surface. Three accessible parking spaces and an access ramp shall be installed in the parking lot adjacent to the Visitor Center.
<p>Interpretive exhibits shall be designed and installed BY OTHERS. There are a number of projects going on at the Scotty's Castle complex with a single access road. Coordination with other contractors is critical on this project.</p>

Performance Work Statement 
Perkin Elmer Analyzer 
Preventative Maintenance Services
22 January 2018
Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System (PVAHCS)
644-18-1-306-0082
Introduction:
This requirement is for Preventative Maintenance Services on one (1) single, Perkin Elmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. This equipment is currently in use at the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Background:
Phoenix Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires services for the maintenance of one (1) Perkin Elmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Model Tri-Carb 3110TR (s/n: DG10129761) being used within the Research Program of the Phoenix VA Health Care System (PVAHCS).  The Perkin Elmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Model Tri-Carb 3110TR is used to detect alpha, beta and gamma radioactivity in samples from experiments with cells and tissues.  It is also used to detect radioactivity from swipes of the research laboratory areas used for the experiments.  This will detect any spills and ensures the safety of staff members conducting research activities.  
The Perkin Elmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Model Tri-Carb 3110TR measures light emitted from samples mixed with scintillation cocktail solution.  Samples are placed into vials; a scintillation cocktail is added and the vials are then placed into the machine.  The machine takes the vials down into the machine and radiation emitting from the sample makes the crystals light up.  The more they light up, the more radiation a sample is emitting.  The light energy is usually converted into electric energy via a photomultiplier to give a meaningful measure.
This is a highly specialized and sophisticated computer controlled machine, requiring specialized training and knowledge to diagnose and fix any problems that occur.  Breakdowns of the machine can also be minimized with the performance of preventative maintenance visits which should be included in the service contract. Only Perkin Elmer Certified Technicians can service and repair the Perkin Elmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Model Tri-Carb 3110TR as the system is proprietary in nature.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought and is for informational purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is currently available. This request does not obligate the Government in any contact award. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. Do not submit cost proposals or cost information.

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Pittsburgh District, is conducting market research to determine the business size and capabilities of potential sources for resurfacing of the deteriorated vertical land wall concrete within the lock chamber at the Allegheny River Lock and Dam 2, Allegheny River, Pennsylvania. The proposed NAICS for the proposed acquisition is 238110 - Poured Concrete Foundation and Structure Contractors.</p>
<p>The information gathered will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION:</p>
<p>Lock No. 2 is located on the Allegheny River near the City of Pittsburgh, at river mile 6.7 above the "Point" in Pittsburgh PA. The facility only has one lock chamber with the lock located on the left descending bank. The lock chamber has a size of 56'x360'and is open to commercial navigation and recreation traffic 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The purpose of this construction contract is to resurface the deteriorated vertical land wall concrete within the lock chamber. The contractor will have access to work within the lock chamber on a 3-2-5-2 schedule, which provides the contractor with a 3 weeks full chamber closure, 2 weeks restricted chamber width to pass navigation, 5 weeks full chamber closure, and 2 weeks restricted chamber width.</p>
<p>Land wall concrete resurfacing will take place within the chamber and cover an area of 360 feet by 22 feet. This area will extend from the top of the wall downward approximately 22 feet, which is roughly around the minimum normal water level. The contract work shall include concrete removal, concrete placement (to include fabrication and placement of precast panels), rebar and anchor installation. Underwater anchor installation and concrete placement may be required depending on tailwater conditions. Below are some specific features, important elements and details that are required as part of the concrete rehabilitation contract:</p>
<p>1. Methods for the concrete removal will require a combination of mechanical removal methods and select blasting methods to an approximate 12 inches to 33 inches in depth depending on location.</p>
<p>2. Concrete debris must be removed from within the lock chamber prior to chamber being open to navigation traffic. The lock chamber will not be dewatered as a part of this contract. All concrete debris within the chamber and specifically below the water surface will need to be removed prior to re-opening the lock chamber for restricted width navigation passage.</p>
<p>3. Resurfacing will consist of precast concrete wall unit panels with a cast-in-place concrete cap and infill tremie placement behind the panels.</p>
<p>4. Resurfacing will be with precast concrete wall panels. These panel are required to be fabricated offsite at a certified precast concrete fabricator. These precast concrete wall panels will vary in thickness of either 7 inches or 27 inches depending on location. Two rows will be required to cover the approximate 19-foot vertical surface along with vertical wall expansion joints at the lock wall monolith joints.</p>
<p>5. Two separate areas along the vertical wall, approximately 24 feet and 30 feet and extend from the top of the wall downward to a depth of approximately 22 feet require concrete removal between existing lock wall armor sections, and the application of shotcrete to fill voids.</p>
<p>6. One area along the vertical wall at the downstream miter gate recess, approximately 34 feet by 22 feet high will require removal of concrete to 12-inch depth and reconstruction using a reinforced cast-in-place concrete surface.</p>
<p>7. The land wall contains a utility gallery within the wall which will require shoring and bracing to ensure the integrity of the gallery system. Additionally, existing exposed hydraulic piping which traverses the lock chamber will need to be protected from contractor operations.</p>
<p>8. Top of wall features to be fabricated and installed include a new handrail system, mooring check posts, grating recess resurfacing and the construction of a kevel rail step.</p>
<p>The planned work lock closure periods includes a three week full lock closure period for construction work, followed by a two week restricted width lock usage period to allow navigation vessels to use the lock, followed by a five week full lock closure construction period and finally a two week restricted width lock usage period to allow navigation vessels passage thru the lock.</p>
<p>Construction work not affecting the lock chamber usage will be permitted to occur outside scheduled navigation closure construction period. Due to the highly compressed work schedule, the contractor may be required to work multiple shifts throughout the work day in order to complete the work.</p>
<p>Construction will take place in the wet, however, there is potential that cofferdams may be utilized for localized dewatering. The work is anticipated to be performed extensively from a floating plant. It is expected that divers will be necessary to support the precast panel installation as well as protection of existing hydraulic/air piping at the site.</p>
<p>Construction work will occur in close proximity to commercial navigation traffic and the operating lock chamber staffed and operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Close coordination and construction activities will be required with the Contracting Officer and the Lockmaster at the facility.</p>
<p>Disposal of excavated materials, concrete rubble and other construction waste material will be at a commercially permitted facility licensed to accept the waste or recycled if applicable.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the contract work will be structured in a base contract with awardable options.</p>
<p>This work will be primarily constructed during a scheduled navigation closure period during the low river level period from early-August to early-October 2019.</p>
<p>INTERESTED SOURCES MUST PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Interested and capable sources are requested to provide complete responses with the following information to Jane Roney, Contract Specialist, no later than 11:00 a.m. EST on February 16, 2018 by email at Janie.L.Roney@usace.army.mil,</p>

<RESPDATE>122417
<CONTACT>Amanda Heller, Email amanda.heller@fema.dhs.gov
<DESC>Notice Type: Limited Sources Justification.
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency hereby provides notice of its intent to award a sole-source modification to increase the ceiling by $7 Million using other than full and open competition on the current "Capability Validation and Delivery through Exercises" Blanket Purchase Agreement HSFE20-16-A-0200 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B), FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), FAR 8.405-6(a)(2), and FAR 5.301. This is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal. This synopsis of intent is to give notice of the Government's intent to make a sole source modification. Contractors who can provide FEMA with the required services, are invited to electronically submit an affirmative, written response indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement.</p>
<p>The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting. Responses should appear on company letterhead and include, at minimum, affirmation of active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM), your Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number, any applicable processed credentials and qualifications, and any applicable information. All responses should include a point of contact, telephone number, and electronic mail address. Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned. Responses to this notice will be used to determine the availability of this type of service. All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis and all responses will be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The proposed effort ensures continuation of essential services. The incumbent maintains the entire established infrastructure in place for the support services of the National Exercise Division. The incumbent already has the required certifications and clearances in place; they are familiar with the complexity of the services and are fully capable of continuing to perform. Award to another contractor is a high risk to the Government requiring ramp up, to include hiring of personnel, and learning the distinctive characteristics of the NED mission. This instant effort is critical to the continued operations of the NED. The Government believes that an attempt by another contractor to assume the support requirements without a transition period would result in delay the development and implementation of exercises needed immediately. Without the increase to the ceiling of the BPA, NED cannot guarantee support to the exercises currently scheduled, which directly hinders national preparedness.</p>
<p>Any responses shall be furnished electronically to the contacts listed below not later than 11:00 A.M. EST, Sunday, December 24, 2017. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)<br />GEORGE C. MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (MSFC) <br />OCCUPATIONAL MEDICAL SERVICES
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to request 1) feasibility input on the Government's approach to a revised requirement 2) to determine if there are two or more capable small businesses that can perform the revised requirement for the follow-on contract to the current Environmental Engineering and Occupational Health Services Contract. It is incumbent on you to use your best judgment in responding to this Notice. The Capability Statements received in response to this notice may lead to a Small Business set-aside if two (2) or more Small Businesses can be determined by the Government to be capable of performing the tasking as described in this RFI's known and potential requirements and in the Draft Performance Work Statement (Attachment 01). Please note that all interested parties, large and small businesses, are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>A. Background</p>
<p>The predecessor contract is NNM13AA80C with HPM Corporation. The PWS is comprised of Program Management, Environmental Compliance, Occupational Health and Industrial Hygiene. The contract is performed on-site at the Medical Center, MSFC Bldg. 4249. The contract has a five-year period of performance and expires October 31, 2018. It is a firm fixed price mission services contract with an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) component. The current value of the contract mission is approximately $4.3M per year. Budgeted amounts are comprised of: Environmental Compliance on-site Support ($.95M/year), Occupational Health (Industrial Hygiene, Health Physics, and Respiratory Protection) ($1.25M/year), and Medical Center ($2.1M/year). Information relating to the current EEOH contract may be requested via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) from: https://www.nasa.gov/FOIA/index.html.</p>
<p>In support of shaping a new approach to the follow on contract, MSFC released RFI number NNM17ZPS003L posted June 28, 2017. This RFI requested feasibility input on three possible cost saving options for performance of program management, occupational medicine, preventive medicine, acute medical care, and emergency medical response services at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and requested suggestions for same. Subsequently, the Government modified cost savings Option a. "to provide at no cost, or reduced cost to the Government, the medical surveillance exams and work related acute care visits for civil servants and Contractor personnel in exchange for charging fee-for-services for preventive health exams and non-occupational acute care visits to the MSFC community, and the Redstone Arsenal Community." This revision now included the Redstone Arsenal Community as a potential population for health services.</p>
<p>Respondents were invited to provide a listing of the types, and respective amounts of information industry may need to develop a business case to support the revision to "Option a." The information requested is at Attachment 02.</p>
<p><br />B. RFI Notice Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to request 1) feasibility input on the Government's approach to a revised requirement 2) to determine if there are two or more capable small businesses that can perform the revised requirement for the follow-on contract to the current Environmental Engineering and Occupational Health Services Contract.</p>
<p>C. Description of Known and Potential Requirements</p>
<p>The basic requirement is for purchase of commercial medical services in support of the MSFC Occupational Health Program on-site at the Medical Center Building 4249. The requirement includes performance of all OSHA and NASA-specific physicals and initial treatment for all work related injuries for all covered personnel. In addition, it includes all Industrial Hygiene program requirements (see covered personnel in PWS at Attachment 01).</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to phase-out the initial requirement to perform approximately 900 on-site Contractor OSHA and NASA-specific physicals from the basic requirement during years 2-5 of the contract. This phase-out will create excess capacity within the medical center. As a cost savings initiative, the Contractor will leverage the excess capacity (equipment) under the Use and Charges clause in their contract, FAR 52.245-9 to provide on-site Contractor OSHA and NASA specific physicals, in exchange for an equipment rental fee to the Government. The Contractor will negotiate separately with on-site Contractors for performing the OSHA and NASA-specific physicals as they are phased out of the contract.</p>
<p>Unlike the current contract, the basic requirement does not include performance of any voluntary civil servant physicals or acute care. However, MSFC is required under NPR 1800.1 to offer voluntary physical examinations to civil servants. Therefore, under Use and Charges the Contractor will offer the excess capacity at the Medical Center to conduct voluntary physicals for civil servants. Because civil servant physicals are already covered by health benefits, the Contractor will accept responsibility for billing fee for services which includes private medical insurance for any voluntary civil servant physicals conducted under Use and Charges.</p>
<p>Excess capacity for conducting medical services may also be offered to the Redstone Community at large. For any commercial service undertaken under the Use and Charges clause, the Contractor is responsible for collecting payment.</p>
<p>The medical services Contractor will undertake the responsibility for advertising uses for the excess capacity at the medical center to include the capacity to conduct OSHA and NASA- specific physicals, voluntary physicals, and acute care. MSFC will allow the Contractor's use of store stock for advertising pamphlets and brochures, and MSFC will advertise clinic capabilities using center electronic social media sites and to the Redstone Community Health Promotions Council (CHPC).</p>
<p>The medical services Contractor will undertake the responsibility to secure HIPPA data (if housed at the Medical Center) that results from the use of excess capacity at the Medical Center under the Use and Charges Clause (e.g. for the Contractor OSHA and NASA-specific physicals, for voluntary physicals, and for acute care) to include maintaining a secure server to store HIPPA data and a secure internet connection to transmit and receive HIPPA data.</p>
<p>Unlike the current contract, the basic requirement does not include performance of any Environmental Compliance functions.</p>
<p>D. Input Requested</p>
<p>As a result of the preceding, the Government requests either an expression of interest in the form of capability statements, or an expression of disinterest in the form of feasibility inputs (see Table F-1 at Attachment 03) addressing the following approach:</p>
<p>A Firm Fixed Price Contract with and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity component for:<br />i. Occupational Medical Services, for approximately 350 civil servants and 900 MSFC on-site Contractors (with the number of on-site Contractor OSHA and NASA-specific physicals to be phased out from 900 to 0 during years 2-5 of performance, according to a TBD schedule in the contract) and work-related injury visits for civil servants and Contractors.<br />ii. Industrial Hygiene, Health Physics, Respiratory Protection<br />iii. Program Management</p>
<p>With the Opportunity for:<br />i. Leveraging excess capacity under Use and Charges clause FAR 52.245-9 for providing commercial services for OSHA and NASA-specific physicals to on-site Contractors (under separate billing arrangements with contractors).<br />ii. Leveraging excess capacity under Use and Charges clause FAR 52.245-9 for providing commercial services for on-site voluntary health maintenance exams for civil servants (billing). <br />iii. Leveraging excess capacity under Use and Charges clause FAR 52.245-9 for providing commercial services for on-site voluntary health maintenance exams, and non-occupational acute care visits to civil servants, on-site Contractors, and the Redstone community (billing "fee for services" to include private medical insurance as payment).</p>
<p><br />E. The Capability Statement shall succinctly address the following three items to demonstrate the Contractor's capability to perform the requirements of the Performance Work Statement at Attachment 01 and in this RFI.</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate your ability to manage as prime Contractor, the type and magnitude of the PWS. Cross reference to specific past performance examples.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrate your technical ability, or potential approach to achieving technical ability, to perform the requirements of the PWS with at least 50% of the cost of the contract for personnel, with your own employees. Include your ability or potential IT approach to segregating and safeguarding HIPPA data collection, storage, and transmission. Include your ability or potential approach, to segregating cost for commercial activity under Use and Charges, and cost for effort under the contract PWS. Cross reference to either specific past performance examples, or specific evidence of how you will achieve technical ability by the 1st day of performance.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate your capacity, or potential approach to achieving capacity, to conduct the requirements of the PWS. (Capacity refers to matters such as magnitude of the tasking, the amount of equipment, supplies, or facilities involved, and the size of the staff needed). Cross reference to specific past performance examples, or specific evidence of how you will achieve required capacity by the 1st day of performance.</p>
<p>F. Also provide the following:<br />a. Company name, <br />b. Website Address<br />c. POC information<br />d. DUNS<br />e. Business Size for the corresponding NAICS code (s) Facilities Support Services -561210, Other Scientific and Consulting Services -54169, All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Services-62199</p>

The Government is available to meet during business hours February 28 to March 1, 2018. Propose with your response a preferred face-to-face meeting date and time and an alternate. Your meeting date/time will scheduled by MSFC. Each meeting is limited to 1 hour, and industry participants are limited to four. Due to time constraints, electronic presentations will not be permitted.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a request for information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will initiate a procurement action in this matter. In addition the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.</p>
<p>The Government intends to use the information provided for the purpose of developing the procurement strategy and potential source list. Any information used will be on a non-attribution basis.

<p>**Additional information will be given on request***</p>
<p>Building 212:<br />Roof system on B212 is standing seam metal roof panels, over shingle lapped self-adhering roofing underlayment membrane, over ventilated nailbase insulation system. B212 roof area is approximately 40,000 square feet and the roof has a 3:12 pitch. Please see attached roof and roof framing plan.</p>
<p>Building 220:<br />Roof system on B220 is standing seam metal roof panels, over continuous self-adhering roofing underlayment, over protective coverboard, over rigid polyisocyanurate board insulation, over 6 mil poly vapor barrier, over metal deck. B220 roof area is approximately 6,900 square feet and has a 2.5:12 monoslope pitch. Please see attached roof and roof framing plan.</p>
<p>Building 521:<br />Standing Seam Metal roof system is SRS2 by Centria. Roof area is approximately 7,000 square feet and the roof has a 2:12 pitch. Please see attached roof and roof framing plan.</p>
<p>Request information on feasibility, estimated cost of service, service options, and support requirements from the base.</p>
<p>- What are the different options available for permanent fall protection systems that are compatible with these roof systems and allow Base workers to perform their required duties?<br />- What price estimates are involved in each option? <br />- What time estimates are involved in each option?<br />- What inspection and maintenance requirements exist for each potential fall protection system?<br />- What additional gear or equipment is required to utilize each potential fall protection system?<br />- What training is required before utilizing the fall protection system? Who can provide this training?<br />- Are there any options available outside of a permanent fall protection system that still meet Base workers' needs?</p>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<p>- Are there any other aspects that we need to consider before contracting for this service?<br />- Are there any comments concerning the NAICS and SBA size standards chosen for this RFI?</p>
<p>Site Visit:</p>
<p>A site visit will be conducted for this RFI on 14 March 2018 at 9:00AM. Coordinate any site visits with SMSgt Christopher Fisher at (218) 788-7242 or via email at at usaf.mn.148-fw.list.msc-personnel@mail.mil .

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>ACTION CODE: SPECIAL NOTICE</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: 66- Instruments and Laboratory Equipment</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Purchase of an Upgrade for a Daylight Solutions Quantum Cascade Laser</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER:  SB1341-18-RQ-0188</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE:  10 days after posting</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Daylight Solutions, Inc. located at 15378 Avenue of Science Ste 200, San Diego, CA 92128-3407 to purchase an upgrade to NIST's existing Daylight Solutions MIRcat mid-infrared Quantum Cascade Laser.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following:  The instrument being upgraded was purchased from Daylight Solutions, who is the sole manufacturer and provider of all parts and repairs for this instrument. NIST requires an upgrade of the system to allow for improved operation capability of the critical equipment by extending the wavelength tuning range. The upgrade components must be compatible with the existing system in order to function. Only Daylight Solutions provides upgrade components which are compatible with the existing system due to the proprietary nature of the existing commercial system. The upgrade of the instrument will be performed at the Daylight Solutions factory. Daylight Solutions does not authorize any third parties to provide the required parts, tools, protocols and software to complete the upgrade.</p>
<p>The upgrade components consist of the following:<br />1.	Wavelength control<br />-	Extension of the tuning range must include between 5.8 &mu;m to 11 &mu;m<br />-	Tuning speed must be equal to or higher than 100 cm-1/s over the whole tuning range<br />-	Multiple laser head modules must meet the above specified tuning speed over the whole tuning range<br />-	Continuous tuning must be available across multiple modules<br />2.	Output power<br />-	Peak power must be higher than 20 mW within the whole wavelength tuning range<br />3.	Other parameters <br />-	Spectral linewidth (full-width-half-maximum) must be equal to or narrower than 1 cm-1<br />-	Pulse-to-pulse stability must equal to or lower than 5% (peak-peak)<br />-	Beam divergence must be equal to or smaller than 5 mrad (full angle, 1/e2 intensity)<br />-	Beam must be linearly polarized with extinction of 100:1 or higher<br />-	Pointing stability must be equal to or smaller than 2 mrad during wavelength tuning over the whole tuning range<br />-	Beam quality must be TEM00</p>
<p>Market research has shown that Daylight Solutions, Inc. is the sole company who can provide this upgrade to NIST's equipment.</p>
<p>Given these facts, Daylight Solutions, Inc. is the only source reasonably available to provide the required upgrade.<br /> <br />The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 5:00 pm EST 02/08/2018, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<SUBJECT>66--Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis
<SOLNBR>68HE0C18Q0048
<ARCHDATE>03302018
<CONTACT>Lower, Angela
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with HBM, Inc. for three 2k Nm inline torque meters and wiring for the U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The NAICS code is 334516. The size standard is 1000 employees. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price (FFP) contract. This requirement will be procured utilizing FAR Part 12 and 13.  
NVFEL already utilizes many HBM T40b inline torque meters in their test cells. The HBM torque meters have a unique wiring pinout, signal conditioning and mechanical bolt pattern which is proprietary to HBM for which NVFEL has standardized its test cells around. These new torque meters are meant to be directly interchangeable replacements and will be used to update the capacity of the ones currently in use. If another product is used, a significant rework of the test cell would be required costing additional time and resources. This rework would involve fabricating new mechanical adapters to the dynamometer drive shaft as well as rewiring that channel to the test cell controller as it will have a different wiring pinout and signal requirements 
HBM, Inc is the only known firm to provide the required torque meters.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered by the agency MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>PLA - Construction Services for Aircraft Facility Renovations, Vermont Air National Guard, located at Burlington Air National Guard Base, South Burlington, VT 
<SOLNBR>W912WJ18B0010
<RESPDATE>022018
<CONTACT>Alysha MacDonald, Phone 9783188715, Email Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil
<DESC><p>The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (the estimated construction magnitude is between $10,000,000.00 and $40,000,000.00) construction project:</p>
<p>The location of the work at the Burlington Air National Guard Base in South Burlington, VT for the Vermont Air National Guard. The project scope of work consists of providing all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools and equipment, to carry out all work and operations as necessary for Construction Services for Aircraft Facility Renovations. The work involves five aircraft support facilities which include three aircraft shelter buildings, one corrosion control facility, and one weapons facility. All of these buildings are existing and currently support F16 Fighting Falcon operations. They are being renovated in order to prepare to support the F35 Joint Strike Fighter specific requirements.</p>
<p>The Government is considering either 1) consolidating all described work into one procurement package or 2) splitting the project into two separate procurements (one for the three aircraft shelters; one for the two maintenance buildings) based upon the results of the market research.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $10M and $40M.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. The complexity of the project.</p>
<p>c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.</p>
<p>f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.</p>
<p>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.</p>
<p>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Construction Project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the construction project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades; do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc...</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via email to Alysha MacDonald, Contract Specialist, at Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil no later than the close of business, 5pm EST on February 20, 2018.</p>

<DESC><p>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities</p>
<p>Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.<br /><br />Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits.<br /><br />You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.</p>

(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>

<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>

<p>(xv) The following Department of Commerce and National Oceanic and Atmospheric terms and conditions apply to this acquisition:</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. (End of clause)</p>

Questions should be received no later than one (1) calendar day after the issuance date of this solicitation.

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, February 8, 2018.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 31.0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Launched in 2013 by President's George W. Bush, and reauthorized in 2008 , PEPFAR holds a place in history as the largest effort by any nation to combat a single disease. Since its inception, PEPFAR has succesfully demonstarted worldwide success in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic with gains particularly evident in Africa. It achieved success in expanding access to HIV prevention, care and treatment in low resource settings.<br />With a projected population of over 100 million people, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite impressive economic growth, Ethiopia remains a low-income country with a <span style="color: #221e1f; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">real per capita income of </span>US $550 and 33.5% of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.90/day. According to the 2015 UN Human Development Index, Ethiopia ranks 174 out of 188 countries on both the overall index and the per capita Gross National Income, with a gross domestic product of $1,428. It is also one of the least urbanized countries, with 80% of the population living in rural areas. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ethiopia continues to be characterized by a low-intensity, mixed epidemic with significant heterogeneity across geographic areas and population groups. There is significant prevalence variation by region; from 4.8% in Addis Ababa, 4.4% in Gambella, to 0.6% in Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples&rsquo; (SNNPR) region.&nbsp; Key and Priority Populations (KP and PP) are key drivers of the epidemic. For KP, PEPFAR-E only targets Female Sex Workers (FSW); and for PP, PEPFAR-E includes divorced and widowed persons, Orphans and Vulnerable Children, HIV negative partners in discordant couples, clients of FSWs, uniformed personnel, and vulnerable adolescent girls and young women. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left: 49.0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 31.0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since 2005 trends in ANC prevalence in Ethiopia show steady and steep declines by as much as 60% according to latest UN models of HIV incidence, and suggest general success of combined prevention efforts by PEPFAR, GOE and other partners.&nbsp; With the right strategies, an AIDS-free generation may be truly achievable in this setting. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">A high circumcision rate (92%), among other factors such as significant gains in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), continue to favor primary prevention among the general population. Among the general population, sources of new infection can be divided into sexual transmission from high-risk behavior before or outside marriage and sexual and vertical transmission occurring within marriage. The aging demographic profile of the epidemic combined with high rates of sero-discordant married couples (65%) imply that more HIV transmission occurs within marriage compared to other African epidemics; remarriage rates, however, exceed 40% regardless of gender or residence. Widowed and divorced men and women show substantially higher infection rates than other groups. Early arranged marriage, partner violence, and gender inequality are cited as causes of high divorce rates and significantly elevated rates of HIV prevalence associated with divorce and remarriage. Beginning in 2005, implementation of PEPFAR is through 5 USG agencies: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. State Department (Population and Refugee Migration Office, and the Community Grants Office), Peace Corps, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); however Peace Corps is in the process of transitioning out of PEPFAR. To date bilateral USG investment is $2.6 billion. In addition Ethiopia has been a recipient of over $2 billion from the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund).&nbsp; Given the nature of Ethiopia&rsquo;s epidemic, PEPFAR-E&rsquo;s strategic goals are primarily to (i) support the Government of Ethiopia to achieve the UNAIDS Fast Track Strategy toward sustained epidemic control; and (ii) support the national HIV/AIDS response to strengthen case detection, treatment, care and support interventions toward key and priority populations, and in high HIV burden geographic areas. PEPFAR funds prevention, care and treatment activities implemented at facility and community sites; as well as cross-cutting activities in laboratory, strategic information, and supply chain management. Historically, support for health systems strengthening (HSS) have included efforts to expand the health workforce through support to pre-service training, implementation of Ethiopia&rsquo;s Pharmaceutical Logistics Master Plan, the Laboratory Master Plan, the Health Management Information System Scale-up, Health Sector Financing Reform and Health Insurance, Hospital Reform Implementation Guidelines, and the Human Resources for Health (HRH) strategy. The private healthcare sector is nascent but growing and could be an important complement to the public arena, particularly as the public sector engages private practice as a workforce retention strategy. PEPFAR supports activities through 44 partners including government, civil society, international and local NGOs, and the World Health Organization. In 2014, PEPFAR began transitioning the full care and treatment portfolio to the Ethiopian government, providing funding to eight of 11 Regional Health Bureaus (RHBs) and one international NGO to provide technical assistance. </span></p>

Offerors shall ensure their proposed quantities result in the same number of items<br />required, as identified in the solicitation.<br />Salient Characteristics:<br />Performance<br />1 each Total Hip implant and instrumentation or equivalent with vendor rep available in the<br />operating room during patient specific surgery scheduled for 5 December 2017. Orthopedics<br />carries the Pinnacle Acetabular cup system, which provides sizes 38mm -72mm both Titanium<br />gripton and Titanium porocoat, multihole, and revision cup capabilities. The Altex liners that are<br />used with this system provides the option of neutral, neutral+ 4, per degree +4 and constrained<br />liners to provide maximum stability. The hip system provides options for the following different<br />hip stems which include the Summit, Trilock, solution, AML, and reclaim. The system should<br />include head sizes from 22mm to 40mm in both ceramic and metal options. The CORAIL Hip<br />System offers five different primary stems and a cemented stem. The design of the extra<br />medullary section improves the biomechanics of the stem. The low profile neck increases the<br />range of motion of the stem within the cup before the neck impinges on the cup. The AMT taper<br />(ARTICUL/EZE Mini Taper) captures completely the femoral head reducing the potential for<br />impingement of the cup. The CO RAIL stem has a propriety HA coating on the grit-blasted<br />surface. The HA coated medial to lateral taper resists axial I torsional stresses and promotes<br />osteointegration for optimum fixation. The design of the CORAIL stem, with its titanium alloy and<br />its full hydroxyapatite coating ensures load transfer without abnormal peak forces and allows a<br />very low incidence of thigh pain.<br />(m) The non-FAR Part 12 discretionary FAR, DFARS, AFARS, and MEDCOM provisions<br />included herein are incorporated into this solicitation either by reference or in full text.

The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a<br />HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA<br />Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA<br />requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides<br />that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by<br />reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.<br />(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this<br />BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation,<br />Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary,<br />Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law,<br />Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.<br />-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized<br />access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than<br />authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than<br />authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing<br />definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.<br />-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in<br />the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business<br />Associate signatory to this BAA].<br />-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under<br />which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of<br />the MHS component signatory to this BAA.<br />-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD<br />HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component<br />signatory to this BAA].<br />-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office<br />Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region<br />Medical Directorate (NCRMD).<br />-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD<br />Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18<br />(2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).<br />-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are<br />DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).<br />-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45<br />CFR 164.402.<br />-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules,<br />9<br />issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part<br />160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160,<br />Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules,<br />implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25,<br />2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding<br />electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are<br />not included in the term HIPAA Rules.<br />-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army,<br />Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.<br />I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by<br />the Agreement or as required by law.<br />(b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA<br />Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for<br />by the Agreement.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware,<br />and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to<br />electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it<br />becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at<br />any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the<br />Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.<br />(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable,<br />the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or<br />transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and<br />requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.<br />(e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered<br />Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered<br />Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.<br />(f) The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as<br />directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures<br />as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.<br />(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide<br />an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the<br />Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.<br />(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's<br />obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the<br />requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such<br />obligation(s); and<br />(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the<br />Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.<br />II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services<br />set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to deidentify<br />PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it<br />1<br />permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by<br />the Covered Entity.<br />(b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the<br />HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and<br />procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD<br />HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and<br />disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal<br />responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.<br />(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the<br />proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal<br />responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to<br />disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.<br />(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for<br />the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal<br />responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the<br />Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed<br />that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the<br />purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate<br />of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been<br />breached.<br />(f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide<br />Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.<br />III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and<br />Restrictions<br />(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices<br />that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding<br />provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the<br />permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes<br />affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.<br />(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or<br />disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR<br />164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of<br />PHI.<br />IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity<br />The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner<br />that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government<br />regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity,<br />except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and<br />administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.<br />V. Breach Response<br />(a) In general.<br />1<br />In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall<br />follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both<br />the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business<br />Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a<br />breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy<br />Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute<br />an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA<br />breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach<br />response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business<br />Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as<br />directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of<br />the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not<br />constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act<br />Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate<br />shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.<br />This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as<br />implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business<br />Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected<br />individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include<br />possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall<br />implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's<br />discovery of a possible breach.<br />(b) Government Reporting Provisions<br />The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity<br />and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed<br />appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a<br />breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable<br />diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an<br />employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.<br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at<br />https://forms.us-cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall<br />save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the USCERT<br />Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as<br />of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report<br />by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained,<br />following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall<br />provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable<br />Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about USCERT<br />reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the<br />US-CERT office.<br />The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements<br />are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy<br />can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act<br />(FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries<br />are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be<br />deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform<br />the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is<br />appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if<br />appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report<br />updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.<br />1<br />When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information,<br />or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a<br />revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any<br />revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall<br />report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root<br />cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident<br />containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly<br />after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the<br />Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The<br />Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach<br />Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the<br />Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the<br />HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by<br />DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the<br />Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office,<br />which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying<br />the above requirements are needed.<br />(c) Individual Notification Provisions<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business<br />Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as<br />possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the<br />individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to<br />determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.<br />The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be<br />submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and<br />for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the<br />DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If<br />different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business<br />Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text<br />of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be<br />provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the<br />individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:<br />-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply<br />state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs,<br />and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data<br />elements potentially have been breached.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The<br />description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the<br />breach occurred.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking<br />or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the<br />individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the<br />FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.<br />-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free<br />credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of<br />credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to<br />follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and<br />1<br />contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal<br />address) for obtaining more information.<br />Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected<br />individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data<br />Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business<br />Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include<br />contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal<br />address.<br />If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach,<br />some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business<br />Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the<br />Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be<br />reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are<br />ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will<br />determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or<br />reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in<br />accordance with Privacy Office approval.<br />The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a<br />breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for<br />addressing.<br />Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security<br />incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of<br />PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate<br />shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any<br />point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach<br />(suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response<br />procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber<br />security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as<br />determined by DoD/DHA.<br />VI. Termination<br />(a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or<br />subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to<br />termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.<br />(b) Effect of Termination.<br />(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle<br />such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does<br />not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with<br />paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI<br />to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business<br />Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement<br />provisions or DHA direction.<br />(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the<br />following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business<br />Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received<br />by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still<br />maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors<br />or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.<br />1<br />(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate<br />determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide<br />to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon<br />mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of<br />PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such<br />PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or<br />destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.<br />VII. Miscellaneous<br />(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of<br />this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.<br />(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that<br />permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the<br />DoD HIPAA Rules.<br />(End of clause)<br />(End of Addendum to 52.212-4)<br />52.212-5 -- CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT<br />STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN<br />2017) (DEVIATION 2013-O0019)This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the<br />format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.<br />This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: quotes are being requested and a written<br />solicitation will not be issued.

Orthopedics<br />carries the Pinnacle Acetabular cup system, which provides sizes 38mm -72mm both Titanium<br />gripton and Titanium porocoat, multihole, and revision cup capabilities. The Altex liners that are<br />used with this system provides the option of neutral, neutral+ 4, per degree +4 and constrained<br />liners to provide maximum stability. The hip system provides options for the following different<br />hip stems which include the Summit, Trilock, solution, AML, and reclaim. The system should<br />include head sizes from 22mm to 40mm in both ceramic and metal options. The CORAIL Hip<br />System offers five different primary stems and a cemented stem. The design of the extra<br />medullary section improves the biomechanics of the stem. The low profile neck increases the<br />range of motion of the stem within the cup before the neck impinges on the cup. The AMT taper<br />(ARTICUL/EZE Mini Taper) captures completely the femoral head reducing the potential for<br />impingement of the cup. The CO RAIL stem has a propriety HA coating on the grit-blasted<br />surface.

The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a<br />HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA<br />Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA<br />requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides<br />that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by<br />reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.<br />(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this<br />BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation,<br />Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary,<br />Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law,<br />Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.<br />-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized<br />access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than<br />authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than<br />authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing<br />definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.<br />-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in<br />the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business<br />Associate signatory to this BAA].<br />-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under<br />which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of<br />the MHS component signatory to this BAA.<br />-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD<br />HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component<br />signatory to this BAA].<br />-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office<br />Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region<br />Medical Directorate (NCRMD).<br />-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD<br />Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18<br />(2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).<br />-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are<br />DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).<br />-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45<br />CFR 164.402.<br />-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules,<br />9<br />issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part<br />160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160,<br />Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules,<br />implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25,<br />2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding<br />electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are<br />not included in the term HIPAA Rules.<br />-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army,<br />Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.<br />I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by<br />the Agreement or as required by law.<br />(b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA<br />Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for<br />by the Agreement.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware,<br />and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to<br />electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it<br />becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at<br />any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the<br />Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.<br />(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable,<br />the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or<br />transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and<br />requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.<br />(e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered<br />Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered<br />Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.<br />(f) The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as<br />directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures<br />as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.<br />(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide<br />an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the<br />Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.<br />(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's<br />obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the<br />requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such<br />obligation(s); and<br />(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the<br />Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.<br />II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services<br />set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to deidentify<br />PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it<br />1<br />permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by<br />the Covered Entity.<br />(b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the<br />HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and<br />procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD<br />HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and<br />disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal<br />responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.<br />(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the<br />proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal<br />responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to<br />disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.<br />(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for<br />the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal<br />responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the<br />Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed<br />that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the<br />purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate<br />of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been<br />breached.<br />(f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide<br />Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.<br />III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and<br />Restrictions<br />(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices<br />that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding<br />provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the<br />permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes<br />affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.<br />(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or<br />disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR<br />164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of<br />PHI.<br />IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity<br />The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner<br />that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government<br />regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity,<br />except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and<br />administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.<br />V. Breach Response<br />(a) In general.<br />1<br />In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall<br />follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both<br />the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business<br />Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a<br />breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy<br />Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute<br />an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA<br />breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach<br />response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business<br />Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as<br />directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of<br />the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not<br />constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act<br />Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate<br />shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.<br />This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as<br />implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business<br />Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected<br />individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include<br />possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall<br />implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's<br />discovery of a possible breach.<br />(b) Government Reporting Provisions<br />The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity<br />and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed<br />appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a<br />breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable<br />diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an<br />employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.<br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at<br />https://forms.us-cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall<br />save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the USCERT<br />Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as<br />of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report<br />by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained,<br />following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall<br />provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable<br />Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about USCERT<br />reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the<br />US-CERT office.<br />The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements<br />are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy<br />can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act<br />(FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries<br />are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be<br />deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform<br />the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is<br />appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if<br />appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report<br />updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.<br />1<br />When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information,<br />or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a<br />revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any<br />revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall<br />report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root<br />cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident<br />containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly<br />after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the<br />Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The<br />Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach<br />Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the<br />Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the<br />HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by<br />DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the<br />Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office,<br />which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying<br />the above requirements are needed.<br />(c) Individual Notification Provisions<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business<br />Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as<br />possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the<br />individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to<br />determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.<br />The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be<br />submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and<br />for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the<br />DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If<br />different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business<br />Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text<br />of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be<br />provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the<br />individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:<br />-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply<br />state that PII has been lost.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this competitive RFQ to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9, whose quote conforms to the solicitation's requirements, and is the lowest evaluated price with an "Acceptable" rating in the technical factor. If an offeror fails to meet all solicitation requirements, the Government may not make an award to that offeror. The successful quote shall be rated as Acceptable in Technical and be the lowest price.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical and Price.</p>
<p>Factor I: Technical (Acceptable/Unacceptable)</p>
<p>Factor II: Price. Price Reasonableness will be determined by evaluating the total price.</p>
<p>For efficiency purposes, the Government will evaluate a minimum of the three (3) lowest priced offerors for technical acceptability. After all three lowest priced offerors are evaluated for technical acceptability, if any of the three lowest priced offerors are deemed technically acceptable, no higher-priced offerors will be evaluated. Award will be made to the responsible, lowest-priced technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical: Each quoter shall demonstrate in their quote that their proposed services meet the minimum specifications as identified in Attachment I of the RFQ. This includes certifying that all proposed equipment and parts are compliant with the Trade Agreements Act and acknowledging that installation of the equipment is included.</p>

This section shall clearly and specifically articulate the Quoter's self-assessment of the relevancy of their corporate experience to the services required by the solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluation: The technical quotes will be rated acceptable or unacceptable using the ratings and descriptions outlined in the table below. In order to be considered Acceptable, quoters must receive an acceptable rating for the technical factor in its entirety. Quotes that fail to meet the requirements in Attachment 1 will be considered Unacceptable.</p>
<p>&bull; Corporate Experience: The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Quoter's corporate experience is recent and relevant, and the extent to which the experience indicates probability of success in future performance under this contract.</p>
<p>Rating Description <br />Acceptable Based on the Contractor's Corporate Experience, the Government anticipates a likely probability of success in future performance under this contract. The quote meets the requirements in the Performance Work Statement (PWS); Attachment I.<br />Unacceptable Based on the Contractor's Corporate Experience, the Government anticipates that the contractor will not succeed in future performance under this contract. The quote does not meet the requirements in the Performance Work Statement (PWS); Attachment I.</p>
<p>Based on the Contractor's Corporate Experience, the Government anticipates probability of success in future performance under this contract.</p>
<p>Only an acceptable contract can proceed to price evaluation.</p>
<p>Factor II - Price Evaluation Criteria: Price quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.</p>
<p>Quoters responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request quoters to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to include pricing for the additional 6 month period, to the total price for the basic requirement based on individual unit pricing, not at the quantity of five pricing. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The Government has included the FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services and shall be exercised as required.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) The government is not interested in the vendor providing exam vouchers in the price.</p>

The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Senior Program Performance Management Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition, stabilization, and conflict mitigation programs, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field. The Senior Program Performance Management Specialist will directly supervise Monitoring and Evaluation Specialists and manage a contract to provide data analysis and Geographic Information Systems services to OTI programs.</p>
<p>OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.<br /><br />To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:</p>
<p>1. Increased transparency and accountability between the headquarters and field teams;<br />2. Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3. Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4. More guidance available in online format;<br />5. Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Performance Management Specialist supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve country program performance. The Senior Program Performance Management Specialist does this by: designing and providing innovative solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced global needs; developing and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm. Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>USAIDs LAB/CDR team seeks to develop a Research Technical Assistance Center to support scientific and research-based technical assistance (TA) needs for the Agency by leveraging the technical and research expertise of the higher education community.  Anticipated activities include: creation of evidence-to-action policy briefs, technical reports, strategic research agenda setting and research activity consultations, coordination of university-based researchers for expert panels or convenings, sector-focused trainings, and other short-term technical assistance (STTA) or related TA.
<p>Of note, this Contract will be a sister-activity to the Long-term Assistance and SErvices for Research (LASER), which will likely be a Cooperative Agreement focused on providing long-term TA and research support for the Agency.  RTAC will be expected to coordinate with LASER as needed and be available to publish products from LASER work on a proposed RTAC information-sharing platform.</p>
<p>RTAC will provide timely research-based technical assistance that facilitates USAID's capability to make quick, evidence-based programming decisions by leveraging the technical expertise of the higher education community.  Anticipated activities include: creation of evidence-to-action policy briefs and technical reports; strategic research agenda setting and research activity consultations; coordination of university-based researchers for expert panels or convenings and sector-focused trainings; and provision of additional technical assistance support.  CDR anticipates that the successful RTAC Prime will establish and maintain a network of individual graduate students, faculty, and researchers with current academic affiliations, who would apply directly to the RTAC Prime to participate as a part of the RTAC Partner Pool.  These individuals would then be available to serve as individual technical advisors, via subcontract agreements, upon whom USAID can call on for support across a wide variety of technical sectors as needed.<br /><br />To maintain fairness throughout this competitive process and per the notice of funding opportunity; there will be no face to face or phone conversations/meetings relative to the RTAC solicitation. Please submit all questions concerning this RFP via e-mail to Trenae Bonner at tbonner@usaid.gov with a copyto both the Administrative CO Roderick Watson at rwatson@usaid.gov and labcdr_feedback@usaid.gov, no later than 12 pm EST on February 9, 2018.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>2. Is there a specified formatted pricing spreadsheet/worksheet that the Government would like us to use for final quote submission?</p>

The Small Business Participation Plan does not have a page limitation; however, the Contractor s Proposals shall provide the detailed information below:
All contractors must complete and submit the Small Business Participation Plan. Contractors must provide a Small Business Participation Plan proposing their goals for this solicitation to include Small Business Participation. This plan shall include an overall goal which shall be accomplished through collective small business participation from any type of small business or sub-category small business. A small business can achieve the goals through its own performance/participation as a prime without having to subcontract. The current Veterans Affairs agency goals/target percentages are below:
FY 18 VA subcontracting goals  
Category Target (Percentage)
Total U.S. -------------------------------
Total Small Business 17.0%
Veteran Owned Small Business 7%
Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 5%
Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including Section 8(a)) 5%
Women-Owned Small Business 5%
Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business  3%
 
The work performed directly by a small business prime contractor will be evaluated as Small Business Participation.   A small business is NOT required to subcontract out any portion of the work.  This factor gives the small businesses the opportunity to indicate that they will meet small business participation through self-performance, or, in addition to any subcontracting to small businesses. This Small Business Participation Plan is required to be submitted for evaluation of this factor.
All contractors at a minimum are required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan individually addressing the following areas: 
(1) The extent to which Small Business firms are specifically identified in quotes; 
(2) The extent of commitment to Small Business firms (enforceable commitments, such as established relationships, will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones); 
 (3) The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform;  
(4) The extent of utilization of Small Business firms on prior contracts;
(5) The evaluation will be based on the total contract dollar value, the contractors propose in terms of small business participation.
(6) The extent of participation of Small Business concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition and the extent of which the contractor provides detailed explanations and supporting documentation of the proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof, for this acquisition. Contractors proposed goals are to be filled-in as provided below:
(a) Prime Contractor type of business (check all that apply):

(  ) Large 
(  ) Small (also check type of small business)
(  ) Small Non-Disadvantaged Business 
(  ) Small Disadvantaged Business*
(  ) Woman-Owned Small Business **
(  ) HUB Zone Small Business 
(  ) Veteran Owned Small Business 
(  ) Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Business
(b)  Total Contract Value (for five year period):  $______________
(c)  Dollar Value of your participation as a prime contractor: $____________
(d)  Dollar value and percentage of the total contract value of subcontractors planned for:
Business Category Dollar Value Percentage of Total Contract Value
Large   
Small Disadvantaged Business*  
Total Small Business  
Woman Owned Small Business  
Hub Zone Small Business  
Veteran Owned Small Business  
Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business  
*Note: Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HCBU/Mis) are considered as disadvantaged and should not be broken out separately.
Each percentage above shall be accompanied by detailed supporting documentation in the Small Business Participation Plan regarding individual commitments.
The sum of the dollar values and percentages of Small Non-Disadvantaged and Small Disadvantaged should equal the entries for the Total Small.  However, the sum of all the percentages need not equal 100% since the prime is not included and individual subcontractors may be counted towards more than one category.
(e)  List the principal supplies/services (be specific) to be subcontracted to:  
Business Category Name of Company Type of Service/Supply
Large   
Small Disadvantaged Business**  
Total Small Business

Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (OCT 2014)
The Government intends to award without discussions however; the Government retains the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary. Offerors are urged to ensure that their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Failure to include all required documentation as required in this RFP, may result in your submission being found to be technically unacceptable and removed from further consideration. 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. Each non-cost factor will be rated acceptable/unacceptable. To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved for technical and past performance.

FACTOR 1: Price
FACTOR 2: Technical
FACTOR 3: Past Performance
FACTOR 4: Small Business Participation Plan

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors listed as shown below:
1.  PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price.  However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price proposals to ensure price reasonableness of the services or products being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.
The Government will evaluate proposals by adding the total of all line item prices for the base and all options.  Pricing may be compared against the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) or against the average mean of the offers received and may be used to set a competitive range if discussions are deemed necessary.

The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror s past performance. The Government reserves the right to determine the relevance of past performance information.  If no past performance information is readily available, the Offeror s past performance will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.

A10. This was a typo, Section B.4 should have been labeled as Statement of Works & B.6 should be SBA ACT 8 (d) (13) (B).
Q11. Industry standards over approximately the last 15 years or so have reflected a delivery schedule of 20 days to transfer headstones to the carrier for designated delivery. The normal timeframe from burial of the Veteran to installing the headstone and closing the file is 60 days. However, in Section 3.1 Performance Period, the Solicitation now only provides 15 days total for delivery to the designated cemetery. Please explain the sharp departure from current industry standard, and consider revising to allow a reasonable amount of time to deliver.
A11. The National Cemetery Administration is continuing to promote faster delivery of completed monuments.   The selected contractor's ability to achieve this goal will be evaluated following award.

Q12. Does contracting anticipate the addition of any international cemeteries for delivery? If so, what are the shipping requirements including the delivery term, and who is responsible for any customs tariffs or fees imposed?

Q14. Will the VA allow additional charges for costs incurred from unforeseen consequences beyond the control of the Contractor?
A14. The Contractor s proposal shall include all necessary costs to perform the services requested. Therefore, all prices shall be all inclusive at time of proposal submission. 
Q15.

A15. The price is all inclusive and covers the complete inscription ordered, regardless of one or two sides.
Q16. Do the cemeteries on Attachment 1 have contracts for R2 inscriptions? If not would that

The Small Business Participation Plan does not have a page limitation; however, the Contractor s Proposals shall provide the detailed information below:
All contractors must complete and submit the Small Business Participation Plan. Contractors must provide a Small Business Participation Plan proposing their goals for this solicitation to include Small Business Participation. This plan shall include an overall goal which shall be accomplished through collective small business participation from any type of small business or sub-category small business. A small business can achieve the goals through its own performance/participation as a prime without having to subcontract. The current Veterans Affairs agency goals/target percentages are below:
FY 18 VA subcontracting goals  
Category Target (Percentage)
Total U.S. -------------------------------
Total Small Business 17.0%
Veteran Owned Small Business 7%
Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 5%
Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including Section 8(a)) 5%
Women-Owned Small Business 5%
Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business  3%
 
The work performed directly by a small business prime contractor will be evaluated as Small Business Participation.   A small business is NOT required to subcontract out any portion of the work.  This factor gives the small businesses the opportunity to indicate that they will meet small business participation through self-performance, or, in addition to any subcontracting to small businesses. This Small Business Participation Plan is required to be submitted for evaluation of this factor.
All contractors at a minimum are required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan individually addressing the following areas: 
(1) The extent to which Small Business firms are specifically identified in quotes; 
(2) The extent of commitment to Small Business firms (enforceable commitments, such as established relationships, will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones); 
 (3) The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform;  
(4) The extent of utilization of Small Business firms on prior contracts;
(5) The evaluation will be based on the total contract dollar value, the contractors propose in terms of small business participation.
(6) The extent of participation of Small Business concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition and the extent of which the contractor provides detailed explanations and supporting documentation of the proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof, for this acquisition. Contractors proposed goals are to be filled-in as provided below:
(a) Prime Contractor type of business (check all that apply):

(  ) Large 
(  ) Small (also check type of small business)
(  ) Small Non-Disadvantaged Business 
(  ) Small Disadvantaged Business*
(  ) Woman-Owned Small Business **
(  ) HUB Zone Small Business 
(  ) Veteran Owned Small Business 
(  ) Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Business
(b)  Total Contract Value (for five year period):  $______________
(c)  Dollar Value of your participation as a prime contractor: $____________
(d)  Dollar value and percentage of the total contract value of subcontractors planned for:
Business Category Dollar Value Percentage of Total Contract Value
Large   
Small Disadvantaged Business*  
Total Small Business  
Woman Owned Small Business  
Hub Zone Small Business  
Veteran Owned Small Business  
Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business  
*Note: Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HCBU/Mis) are considered as disadvantaged and should not be broken out separately.
Each percentage above shall be accompanied by detailed supporting documentation in the Small Business Participation Plan regarding individual commitments.
The sum of the dollar values and percentages of Small Non-Disadvantaged and Small Disadvantaged should equal the entries for the Total Small.  However, the sum of all the percentages need not equal 100% since the prime is not included and individual subcontractors may be counted towards more than one category.
(e)  List the principal supplies/services (be specific) to be subcontracted to:  
Business Category Name of Company Type of Service/Supply
Large   
Small Disadvantaged Business**

Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (OCT 2014)
The Government intends to award without discussions however; the Government retains the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary. Offerors are urged to ensure that their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Failure to include all required documentation as required in this RFP, may result in your submission being found to be technically unacceptable and removed from further consideration. 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. Each non-cost factor will be rated acceptable/unacceptable. To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved for technical and past performance.

FACTOR 1: Price
FACTOR 2: Technical
FACTOR 3: Past Performance
FACTOR 4: Small Business Participation Plan

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors listed as shown below:
1.  PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price.  However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price proposals to ensure price reasonableness of the services or products being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.
The Government will evaluate proposals by adding the total of all line item prices for the base and all options.  Pricing may be compared against the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) or against the average mean of the offers received and may be used to set a competitive range if discussions are deemed necessary.

The Government reserves the right to determine the relevance of past performance information.  If no past performance information is readily available, the Offeror s past performance will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.

All contractors will be evaluated on the level of small business commitment they demonstrate for this acquisition. Work performed directly by a small business prime contractor will be evaluated as Small Business Participation. A small business is NOT required to subcontract out any portion of the work.

A14. Yes, there is a possibility. It will depend on the delivery location listed on the individual order and the Contractor shall confirm delivery requirements with the cemetery prior to delivery. It is the Contractor 
Q15. What happens if a stone is delivered to a private cemetery and the cemetery refuses to receive the stone because the cemetery fee has not been paid? How is this handled? Who pays the extra charges incurred? 
A15. I have not heard of this happening.  The headstone is usually not ordered until all cemetery fees are paid up front.  If this does happen, the contractor will be responsible for all charges.
 
Q16. If the person receiving the delivery signs the freight bill as receiving the shipment with no damage, then a few days later they notify MPS and report that the stone is damaged, is the contractor expected to replace the stone at no charge? Since the freight bill was signed as the stone having no damage, the carrier is not going to pay a claim for damage. How will this be handled? 
A16. No, the contractor will receive a re-order for the headstone.  Both headstones will be invoiced for payment.

Q17. How will the contractor be notified of a damaged stone and what documentation will be provided to file a valid claim with the carrier?
A17. The normal practice is to receive a photo of the damaged headstone, any other photos of packaging or pallets and a copy of the BOL.  This will be forwarded to the contractor for submitting a claim to the carrier.

Q18. When Emblem # 43 (Farohar) was used for a sample back in 2014 we found it almost impossible to sandblast 6/32" to 8/32" deep between the dots on the wings of the emblem without blowing out the dots. Will the sample grader take that in consideration when grading the wings and measure other areas of the emblem for the required depths?

A18. Your sample was approved for this required depth, so I guess the sandblast isn t a problem anymore.
