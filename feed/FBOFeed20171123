<p><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.<br /></strong><br />The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under the following NAICS and PSC Codes:<br /><br />NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services - Small Business Standard is $15M <br />PSC Code R425, Support- Professional: Engineering/Technical</p>
<p>Contractor services are needed to assist HUD in performing monitoring and inspection services of the Design Approval Primary Inspection Agencies (DAPIA) as established under the National Manufacturing Housing Construction &amp; Safety Act of 1974. Monitoring and inspection services include performing assessment inspections, monitoring and enforcement of the private and state agents of HUD responsible for oversight of design and construction of manufactured housing and is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements. <br /><br />Please review the draft performance work statement (PWS) and provide your feedback to Jerl Traylor at ManufacturedHousingMonitoringServices@hud.gov.</p>
<p>HUD is contemplating acquiring the following services: <br /><br />HUD is seeking a Contractor to perform inspections, assessments, and monitoring of the private and state agents of HUD responsible for the oversight of the design and quality assurance manuals for manufactured housing (DAPIA functions).

The Act, as amended by the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 2000 sets forth authority for HUD to:<br />&nbsp;<br />&bull; Develop and enforce federal manufactured housing construction and safety standards, <br />&bull; Establish a Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee to make recommendations on new or revised construction and safety standards through an administering organization, <br />&bull; Establish a dispute resolution program, administered through contracted assistance; and <br />&bull; Mandates implementation of an installation program administered by qualifying state agencies or by HUD.</p>
<p>Through the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD's) Office of Manufactured Housing Programs (OMHP), unsubsidized affordable housing is available for many families who might otherwise not be able to afford home ownership. Approximately eight (8) million manufactured homes have been built under HUD's Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Program since 1976. About 50 companies produce manufactured housing in 129 plants (production lines) with current production of about 100,000 floors per federal fiscal year.</p>
<p>HUD administers the program, supported by agreements with SAAs and various contractors. <br /><br />HUD also uses the services of an administering organization to support the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee; a committee that provides recommendations to the Secretary of HUD to adopt and revise certain standards and regulations. In addition to SAAs and HUD's contractors there are currently six (6) DAPIAs and fourteen (14) IPIAs, both public and private, approved by HUD to conduct design review and in-plant surveillance, respectively. Nine (9) of the fourteen (14) active HUD-approved agencies are units of State government and the remaining five (5) are private for-profit corporations.</p>
<p>All designs and design changes must be approved by a manufacturers DAPIA that also approves each plants quality assurance manual. The DAPIA is responsible to ensure that designs conform to the requirements of the Standards and incorporate acceptable engineering practices.</p>
<p>Each manufacturer must also obtain the services of an IPIA. The IPIA must determine that the plants under its purview are capable of producing homes in conformance with the Standards on a continual basis and issue a certification. After the certification, the IPIA is responsible to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the manufacturers quality control program through surveillance and inspections of each home at some stage of production. If the IPIA is satisfied, it may issue the HUD-required certification labels that are attached to each section of each home upon completion. Combined, the IPIAs certify and provide ongoing surveillance at all active manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>Each SAA with manufacturers in state have responsibilities to approve and monitor manufacturer systems for compliance with 24 CFR Part 3283 Subpart I in addition to responsibilities for handling consumer complaints. Each SAA without manufacturers in state have responsibilities for handling consumer complaints (i.e. forwarding complaints to the manufacturer and to the SAA in the state of manufacturer, and or HUD if there is no SAA.</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible to audit IPIA performance and SAA performance with an outcome of each assessment resulting in a determination as to whether the IPIA and SAA is fulfilling all the regulatory responsibilities and is meeting HUD's expectations.</p>

This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.<br /><br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under the following NAICS and PSC Codes:</p>
<p>NAICS Code 541350 Building Inspection Services - Small Business Standard is $7.5M <br />PSC Code R425, Support- Professional: Engineering/Technical</p>
<p>Contractor services are needed to assist HUD in performing monitoring and inspection services of the In-Plant Primary Inspection Agencies (IPIA) and State Administrative Agencies (SAA) as established under the National Manufacturing Housing Construction &amp; Safety Act of 1974. Monitoring and inspection services include performing assessment inspections, monitoring and enforcement of the private and state agents of HUD responsible for oversight of design and construction of manufactured housing and is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements.</p>
<p>Please review the draft performance work statement (PWS) and provide your feedback to Jerl Traylor at ManufacturedHousingMonitoringServices@hud.gov.</p>
<p>HUD is contemplating acquiring the following services:<br /><br />HUD is seeking a Contractor to perform inspections, assessments, and monitoring of the private and state agents of HUD responsible for the oversight of the construction, inspection, and oversight of quality assurance programs of manufactured housing (IPIA functions) as well as enforcement of notification and correction campaigns and related recordkeeping pursuant to Subpart I of the Regulations (SAA functions). The monitoring and inspection services shall include:</p>
<p>&bull; Management and Administration<br />&bull; IPIA monitoring audits and assessments<br />&bull; SAA monitoring audits and assessments<br />&bull; Ancillary Services including special investigations, regulatory specialist services, and other administrative and technical support</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (the Act), implemented in June 1976, established the framework for HUD's development and implementation of the federally preemptive manufactured housing construction program. The Act, as amended by the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act of 2000 sets forth authority for HUD to:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and enforce federal manufactured housing construction and safety standards, <br />&bull; Establish a Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee to make recommendations on new or revised construction and safety standards through an administering organization, <br />&bull; Establish a dispute resolution program, administered through contracted assistance; and <br />&bull; Mandates implementation of an installation program administered by qualifying state agencies or by HUD.</p>
<p>Through the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD's) Office of Manufactured Housing Programs (OMHP), unsubsidized affordable housing is available for many families who might otherwise not be able to afford home ownership. Approximately eight (8) million manufactured homes have been built under HUD's Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Program since 1976. About 50 companies produce manufactured housing in 129 plants (production lines) with current production of about 100,000 floors per federal fiscal year.</p>
<p>HUD administers the program, supported by agreements with SAAs and various contractors. <br />HUD also uses the services of an administering organization to support the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee; a committee that provides recommendations to the Secretary of HUD to adopt and revise certain standards and regulations. In addition to SAAs and HUD's contractors there are currently six (6) DAPIAs and fourteen (14) IPIAs, both public and private, approved by HUD to conduct design review and in-plant surveillance, respectively. Nine (9) of the fourteen (14) active HUD-approved agencies are units of State government and the remaining five (5) are private for-profit corporations.</p>
<p>All designs and design changes must be approved by a manufacturers DAPIA that also approves each plants quality assurance manual. The DAPIA is responsible to ensure that designs conform to the requirements of the Standards and incorporate acceptable engineering practices.</p>
<p>Each manufacturer must also obtain the services of an IPIA. The IPIA must determine that the plants under its purview are capable of producing homes in conformance with the Standards on a continual basis and issue a certification. After the certification, the IPIA is responsible to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the manufacturers quality control program through surveillance and inspections of each home at some stage of production. If the IPIA is satisfied, it may issue the HUD-required certification labels that are attached to each section of each home upon completion. Combined, the IPIAs certify and provide ongoing surveillance at all active manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>Each SAA with manufacturers in state have responsibilities to approve and monitor manufacturer systems for compliance with 24 CFR Part 3283 Subpart I in addition to responsibilities for handling consumer complaints. Each SAA without manufacturers in state have responsibilities for handling consumer complaints (i.e. forwarding complaints to the manufacturer and to the SAA in the state of manufacturer, and or HUD if there is no SAA.</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible to audit IPIA performance and SAA performance with an outcome of each assessment resulting in a determination as to whether the IPIA and SAA is fulfilling all the regulatory responsibilities and is meeting HUD's expectations.</p>

Statement of work
Automatic Transfer Switch Maintenance

General Scope of Work:  Stratton VA Medical Center in Albany, New York is requesting quotes for a certified manufacturer s representative to perform maintenance on the Automatic Transfer Switches in the Medical Center. The government is currently contemplating the establishment of a base plus four (4) option years contract.  Switches are of various sizes and in various locations for emergency power distribution.

NFPA 8.3.5 
Maintenance shall be performed according to manufacturer s recommendations. In the absence of such recommendations, the list given in 8.3.5 suggests minimal procedures.  Transfer switches should be subjected to an annual maintenance program including:
One major maintenance 
Quarterly inspections. 

Programs shall include all of the following operations where applicable:
Note: Due to the critical nature of these devices, permission shall be gained to perform these tasks since some of the following recommendations could cause disruption of power to the load. The following tasks shall be carefully reviewed with facility management personnel to ensure agreement and plan for contingencies.
Major Maintenance:

Check connections.
A thermographic or temperature scan shall be done prior to this visit, while the ATS is under normal (peak) load. This thermographic scan shall be repeated during the EPSS load test. Results shall be available to the maintenance provider so that suspect conditions can be addressed during this activity.
With power connected to the normal source, measure and record millivolt drop levels across each pole. Note: Any reading that is greater than 25 percent of the average of all poles shall be carefully inspected when the ATS is de-energized.
With power connected to the emergency source, measure and record millivolt drop levels across each pole. Note: Any reading that is greater than 25 percent of the average of all poles shall be carefully inspected when the ATS is de-energized.
If the ATS is equipped with a bypass isolation feature, operate the bypass to the connected source (emergency or normal) and repeat the steps in (a), (b), and (c). Levels shall drop to approximately 50 percent of initial levels and be uniform relative to initial readings. This step verifies that the bypass feature is properly connected and that the connected load will not be affected when the automatic portion is isolated for maintenance.
With power secured and both the emergency and normal sources properly locked out and tagged out, measure the micro-ohm resistance levels across the following connection points:
i. Emergency source cabling lug to bus
ii. Normal source cabling lug to bus
iii. Load cabling lug to bus
iv. Neutral cabling lug to bus
v. Load connected to normal across each pole
vi. Load connected to emergency across each pole
Note: If the ATS is equipped with an isolation bypass and the bypass remains energized, perform these tests on the isolated transfer switch unit only.
