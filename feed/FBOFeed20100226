<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) intends to award a sole source, four year cost-plus-fixed-fee R&amp;D contract, in accordance with FAR Part 15- Acquisition by Negotiation to Safe Place, P.O. Box 19454, Austin, TX 78760.
<p>Safe Place is the developer and owner of the Expect Respect Support Group (ERSG) program. The purpose of this acquisition is to implement a controlled evaluation to determine the effectiveness of Expect Respect Support Groups on reducing teen dating violence victimization and perpetration according to IRB approved procedures. Authority for CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control to collect this data is granted by Section 301 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241). This act gives federal health agencies, such as CDC, broad authority to collect data and do other public health activities, including this type of study. Because this is a sole source procurement, no solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Safe Place.</p>
<p>CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The contractor will conduct a controlled evaluation using the interviewers already hired and trained, and the ERSG curricula they developed and tested in the pilot study. This acquisition is a sole source to Safe Place because the researchers at Safe Place&nbsp;have extensive experience in conducting research on teen dating violence and in the follow-up of such population. In addition, Safe Place has a rapport with the Austin Independent School District (AISD) and surrounding potential control school districts, which have a sufficient student population to be able to recruit the number of participants required for this evaluation (600) within a year's time. Safe Place also has renowned teen dating violence advocacy services for referrals as required. These conditions are critical to adequately follow IRB approved procedures and completing the baseline and follow-up data collection.</p>
<p>CDC believes that Safe Place is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference ERSG Program in the subject line, no later than 11:59 pm Eastern Time, 13 March 2010.</p>

Pursuant to FAR 19.800, this acquisition is set aside for a competition limited to all eligible 8(a) concerns. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.

The VCS was established in 2002, to create a virtual, enterprise-wide, contact center environment that maximizes the use of technologies, resources, and service effectiveness across sites and contractors. The VCS calls for the delivery of premier customer service through a technologically advanced and integrated customer service platform. The platform integrates multiple contractor sites, systems, applications and data sources via a secure data and voice network. There are several essential systems currently implemented that are critical to the VCS goals including the Next Generation Desktop (NGD), Speech Recognition Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Self-Service IVR, Genesys Intelligent Call Routing (ICR), Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), MyMedicare.gov, and the National Data Warehouse (NDW). These integrated systems illustrate the complexity of the current customer service platform. By integrating all beneficiary contact channels with the NGD desktop, CMS is creating a complete and consistent view of the beneficiary and their experience with Medicare. This complete view will allow CMS to better understand its beneficiaries and continuously improve customer service. *****<br /><br />The VCS Help Desk is responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of help desk requests for support regarding the above outlined VCS voice and systems that support 1-800-MEDICARE BCC's. CMS will rely on the Help Desk to provide a single consolidated view of all VCS voice and system related requests for support, system support, and a comprehensive view of voice and system reported issues and service requests with periodic reports while maintaining quality assurance auditing. ***** <br /><br />Offerors are hereby advised that during the initial technical evaluation phase, proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be screened to determine acceptability for award on a pass/fail basis. Proposals that do not pass this first level screening will not be further considered in the source selection process. Specifically, at time of proposal submission, the prime contractor must demonstrate that: 1) they meet the Software Engineering Institute (SEIsm) Capability Maturity Model&reg; Integration (CMMI) Level 3 using Staged Representation; and, 2) have an adequate accounting system. Adequacy of the prime contractor's accounting system shall be evidenced by either a copy of the Government audit report or approval letter from the cognizant Government Contracting Officer. Adequacy must have been within 3 years of proposal submission date and the adequacy determination must be for the prime contractor's business unit submitting the proposal. *****<br /><br />The solicitation will be issued without further notice upon SBA acceptance of the requirement for the section 8(a) program. The formal solicitation package will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS on or about mid March. Questions related to this synopsis should be referred to Debbie Lester at <a href="mailto:Deborah.lester@cms.hhs.gov">Deborah.lester@cms.hhs.gov</a><br />

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR Flight Planning Services.
This is a market survey for Flight Planning Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing Flight Planning.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, with a size standard of $7.0 Million.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:  Type of services provided by your firm,   Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),   Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a DRAFT of the Performance Work Statement. Respondents are encouraged to review the Performance Work Statement and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by March 30th, 2010 3:00 P.M. CST.  Submittals can be by email, fax, or hard copy. All submittals should be submitted to:

<CONTACT>Jennifer Fagan, Phone 3014435861, Email jennifer.fagan@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Red River Computer Company, Inc. (Red River) against its GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract (GS35F0312K) to obtain routers, servers, network switches and VOIP equipment in support of its field and international offices. The FDA competed the BPA in accordance with the requirements of FAR Subpart 8.405.  The Request for Quotations for that acquisition has closed.

As part of its solution comprised of over 300 components making up 23 configurations of equipment and software, Red River proposed incidental/open market items.  These items include: a single model of VOIP phone; certain integrated components of an VOIP conference station; certain integrated components of a VOIP Unity Hardware/Software configuration; certain integrated components of a VOIP CallManger Hardware/Software package; two types of power sources for routers (one for each of two models of routers); extra memory for one model of router; one network switch; CISCO hardware maintenance support package for certain items of CISCO hardware on GSA schedule and the BPA; and certain integrated components of three classes of windows servers.  These items complete Red Rivers overall solution.  In all cases, the incidental/open market items are integral components to configurations in which virtually all of the items are on GSA schedule. 

Acquiring these components from one source will provide a single point of contact for ordering, staging deliveries, and accountability for delivery issues and non-performing units or components.  Due to the quantities being ordered and multiple delivery locations, it is of paramount importance to ensure that deliveries are appropriately coordinated and FDAs administrative oversight is minimized.  The period of performance for this requirement is from date of award through March 15, 2015.  The NAICS code is 334111 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation document is available.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give notification to the Contract Specialist by 8:00am local eastern time on March 14, 2010.  Interested firms must furnish supporting evidence with sufficient detail to demonstrate its ability to comply with the requirement described above.  Interested firms may email the information to the Contract Specialist, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attn: Jennifer Fagan at the email below.  

The FDA will review all responses received; however, the Government retains the sole discretion not to further compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice.  If the FDA does not receive any responses, the FDA will proceed with BPA award to:  Red River Computer Company; 21 Water Street; Suite 500; Claremont, NH 03743.

The anticipated award date of this BPA is on or around March 20, 2010.  

FDA will not accept any collect calls.  If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Jennifer Fagan at (301) 443-5861 or via email at jennifer.fagan@fda.hhs.gov

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMERICAN AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) PROCUREMENT. 

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

The resulting contract will utilize funds provided by the AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) of 2009; interested parties are notified that the inclusion of unique provisions required in implementing the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency, will be required of the successful bidder.

The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the U.S. Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-0489-S-10-0321 on or about March 03, 2010 for the RECOVERY Hebo Ranger District Early Seral Restoration Project - Suislaw National Forest. If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective bidders should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time on or after March 3, 2010 to obtain a copy of the solicitation. All future information about this acquisition will be distributed solely through this website. 

Project Description: The intent of this solicitation is to provide services, equipment, and labor necessary for maintaining or restoring animal populations that need meadow habitat on the Hebo Ranger District.  The primary focus of treatments is controlling unwanted vegetation in or adjacent to meadows. Unwanted vegetation includes but is not limited to non-native grasses, noxious weeds, invasive species, fern, blackberry, shrubs, and small trees. Portions of some meadows are steep and will require good traction to complete treatments.
Treatment methods vary depending on type of vegetation to be removed and the ability to access sites with machinery.  Treatment methods include machine mowing and hand work.  Machine mowing is generally used where machinery has access and the unwanted vegetation can be treated with a mower (grass and small shrubs, blackberry, trees, etc.).  Hand work (hand cutting and hand piling) with chainsaws, weed-eaters, etc. is used where machinery cannot access areas that need treatment.
The amount of effort needed to control unwanted vegetation varies by site. For this solicitation the government expects 67.5 acres of mowing, and 56 acres of hand work.  
The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, supplies, (unless specified elsewhere as Government-furnished) and incidentals required to accomplish the work.

PROJECT LOCATION: This work is located on the Hebo Ranger District of the Suislaw National Forest.

PARTICIPATION: This project is set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 115310. The small business size standard is $7.0 million average income for the last 3 years. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered.

<DESC>Production of Waterways TelevisionI. BackgroundWaterways Television explores the natural and cultural heritage protected by south Florida's national parks, national marine sanctuaries and national wildlife refuges in short, 24-minute episodes to over 4 million potential households. Each segment (usually 2 per episode) of Waterways introduces the viewer to a piece of these public lands and waters, explores what it means to our society, and details what committed people are doing to protect it.Waterways currently airs on 34 public and government stations (52 channels) throughout Florida. In 2004, Waterways was picked up by an out-of-state station-the New York Network, which airs the program on its state university campuses.Waterways is currently a partnership effort between Everglades National Park, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and the Environmental Protection Agency (a silent partner).South Florida presents a rare opportunity for a videographer to tell the stories of a complex and threatened ecosystem within a stone's throw of a large urban population. Waterways strives to promote an understanding of science and restoration in the south Florida's ecosystem, inspire curiosity and passion for our public lands, and encourage conservation action.Waterways addresses the hottest issues facing south Florida: Everglades restoration, coral reefs, the future of Florida Bay, and the role of history and culture in Florida's past and future. Its sophisticated production features field footage, interviews, digital illustration, professional script writing and narration, and music to tell these compelling stories and more. It aims to spark people's interest in and passion for our national parks and associated natural areas. Each segment introduces the viewer to a piece of these public lands and waters, explores what it means to our society, and details what committed people are doing to protect it.
II. PurposeThe purpose of this contract is to produce a minimum of five (5) episodes per year of Waterways Television to spark people's interest in and passion for south Florida's public lands, including its national parks, national marine sanctuaries and wildlife refuges.
III. Scope of WorkEverglades National Park (EVER) is seeking a Contractor for the production and duplication of its environmental education television program, Waterways, presented in cooperation with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) of on-base facilities for Elmendorf AFB, Eielson AFB, associated sites outside of the Base proper, various remote sites, and Fort Richardson, Alaska. The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed$20M per year up to $100M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods. The government may award as many as six (6) contracts. <br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $31M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $31M. <br />It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms serviced by the SBA Alaska District Office or 8(a) firms with a bonafide branch office in the Alaska District Office area which have the applicable NAICS code in their 8(a) business development plan. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. Competition will not be restricted by stage of 8(a) program participation. Joint Venture Agreements: Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents [i.e. tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists, etc.] must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award. Incomplete packages will be returned without action. The joint venture agreement must be approved prior to award of any resulting contract. Failure to obtain SBA's approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBA's request to the buying activity to terminate the award. If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) as soon as possible. <br />The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3). In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Army/Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably. While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective. This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP will identify a model project. All successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.00. The government may compete future individual requirements among the awardees. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 15 Mar 10. The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The magnitude of the model project is between $250,000 - $500,000.00. The entire solicitation, including MACC General Provision and a model project package, will be made available only on Electronic Posting System (EPS) single government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The purpose of this contract is to complement the work started through SAMHSA/CSATs Faith Initiative - Clergy Guide on alcohol and drug problems.  This effort will bring the guide to life in each congregation through an in-house training program on how to implement the suggested steps mentioned in the clergy guide.  The effort will also provide collateral materials for individuals and family members to intervene with appropriate treatment and support needed to recover from alcohol and drug addiction.

In Phase VI, the contractor should disseminate materials already developed and compile lessons learned for the respective faith communities (be it denominational, geographic or allied professionals) to be able to reach those in need of recovery and addiction services with the relevant information to favorably influence their decision to seek treatment or support services. 

This initiative, Phase VI, will teach a cadre of multi-denominational clergy to expand their knowledge and understanding of the impact of alcohol and drug problems, to introduce resources available and useful strategies to intervene positively with affected congregants, including children.

In Phase VI, the Clergy Education and Training Project of the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) will provide the already created SAMHSA/CSAT materials in conjunction with a one-day training event for eight (8) communities that are diverse geographically and racially/ethnically, building on the lessons learned in the previous five phases.

Representatives of ministerial conferences across denominations will be invited and encouraged to participate from the planning stages to the continued distribution and use of the projects materials. 

The materials will be repackaged for use at the congregational level across denominations. Topics will include understanding addiction and the importance of finding the support and help for the affected individuals and family members, and to empower them to initiate and sustain steps toward recovery.  In addition, the initiative will create and conduct training programs for representatives of faith congregations in designated cities. These training programs will demonstrate to clergy how to use the materials effectively to provide support, direction and hope for their congregants and other consumers in these communities. 

The contractor should also design and host a Webinar for current and previous participants as a refresher and motivator to re-energize work already begun and to engage persons not yet trained.

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, supervision, inspection, materials, supplies, parts, tools, equipment, and vehicles required for investigative drilling of exploratory Core Boring (ECP) to locate and define the size of probable voids in the foundation of Joe Harding Dam (Arkansas River Dam #3). The construction will consist of drilling pilot holes (ECP) through the 4' thick stilling basin floor, spaced 65' apart initially so as to determine the presence of the void laterally along the dam, and to determine if any conflict will occur in placing larger diameter bores that may be used for better inspection for voids and/or as injection portals for placing fill into the voids. Work to include but not limited to conducting Conflict Camera Inspection (CCI) via small diameter underwater camera inserted through each pilot bore to determine possible conflict with stilling basin floor concrete embedded items, wood piling and piling head reinforcement, piping, or joints and water stops, and place exploratory borings if voids are found. Based on void detection, intermediate borings will be drilled along the centerline of the initial borings, at 35 feet spacing to obtain more detailed knowledge of the void size and its cause, and to install portals at close enough spacing to assure that remediation infill materials can be injected uniformly and then vibrated to flow thoroughly into the foundation. This project work will proceed incrementally to determine the extent of damage along the dam. A possible additive item of work will be to install flexible stainless steel secondary relief well filers in manholes to stabilize the existing pressure relief system which may be damaged sufficiently to allow foundation soil to still be escaping under normal operation. Another possible additive will be installation of new pressure relief system slide gate valves. Work shall be performed in strict accordance with all the terms, conditions, technical specifications, drawings, attachments, appendices, Exhibits, etc., contained in the specifications. Quantity (1 JOB) - F.O.B. Destination, Arkansas River Dam No. 3, McClellan-Kerr Navigations System at river mile 50.2 near Swan Lake, and Pine Bluff, AR - Jefferson and Lincoln counties.

<DESC><strong>Title of Project: The Electronic Transmission of Molecular Genetics Data to Improve the Completeness and Accuracy of Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) Reporting to State Cancer Registries.<br /></strong><br /><strong>Introduction:</strong>"This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement." The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 622110.<br /><br /><strong>Background.</strong>The quality of data collected and reported by central cancer registries depends, in part, upon the completeness of data reporting. Cancer registries are not currently equipped to validate or confirm diagnoses, and thus rely upon the medical practitioner to accurately identify reportable cases. Hematologic cancers are a complex category with pre-cancerous conditions that may transform into malignant forms over a period of time. Their diagnosis is complex and is not pathologically based which adds to the difficulty both in classifying the case by the physician and in capturing the case by the central cancer registries. In a recent investigation of a cluster of polycythemia vera (PV) in Pennsylvania, a new molecular marker (the JAK2 V617F mutation) was used to validate the diagnosis of suspected PV cases. Many of the confirmed PV cases identified by investigators had not been reported to the state cancer registry, and many cases that were reported to the registry did not satisfy the WHO PV diagnostic criteria in existence at the time of diagnosis. These two factors complicated the data analysis and interpretation of results from the cluster investigation and brought into question the reliability of hematologic cancer reporting on a national level. The electronic transmission of JAK2 V617F test results to central cancer registries from clinical laboratories would provide registries with the necessary information to facilitate accurate and complete reporting of PV and other myeloproliferative neoplasms. In addition, the methods developed can be adapted to report molecular markers for other cancers using the same infrastructure. The proposed work is designed to develop and test a system for the electronic reporting of the JAK2 V617F marker that will also serve as a model for other cancer biomarkers. The findings, methods and technology used to implement this project shall be compatible with software currently in use by state cancer registries (eMARC-plus, etc.), will be considered non-proprietary, and will be made available free of charge to laboratories, cancer registries, and other interested parties.
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong>To (1) improve the reporting of PV and other MPNs to state cancer registries by developing a system to electronically transmit JAK2 V617F test results from clinical laboratories to central cancer registries, (2) design and conduct a state laboratory survey to identify gaps in the reporting of MPN and resources required to implement electronic reporting, and (3) disseminate the results of the project to hematologists/oncologists and cancer registries on a national level.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements.</strong>1. Develop methods and specifications for the development or enhancement of software for use by clinical laboratories to electronically report JAK2 V617F test results to central cancer registries. The software will implement filtering of JAK2 V617F tests and transmit the cases to the central cancer registries using an existing national electronic reporting standard. The software must be compatible and interoperable with existing software used by state cancer registries (such as eMaRC Plus, etc.). The software will be tested and evaluated in at least two different laboratories, a hospital or institutional tumor registry, and a state cancer registry.</p>
<p>2. Devise and test a protocol whereby cancer registrars, at the local and/or state levels, pursue case ascertainment derived from electronically reported JAK2 test results. The protocol will include (a) the use of the JAK2 results to confirm previously reported MPN cases, and follow-up for cases with no reported JAK2 testing, (b) follow-up of JAK2 test results for cases not reported to the registry, (c) a mechanism to ensure that all reportable MPN cases identified are submitted to the state cancer registry per regulations, and (d) a final analysis of the volume and completeness of MPN cases reported to the state cancer registry by the participating institutional registries and/or laboratories over the project period compared to data obtained during a past reference period, and the "yield" for reportable MPN cases derived from positive and negative JAK2 test results.</p>
<p>3. Survey a representative sample of clinical laboratories in at least one state to determine the involvement of these labs in molecular genetic testing, including JAK2; the software used to record molecular genetic testing results; and the barriers that must be overcome in order to implement electronic reporting.</p>
<p>4. Disseminate the results, including methods, technologies, and lessons learned from the project to hematologists and cancer registries on a national level.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated period of performance.</strong> The period of performance shall be 24 months from the contract award date. <br /><br /><strong>Capability statement /information sought.</strong> Please explain, in detail, your experience, knowledge and ability to provide the following:<br />Your opinion about the difficulty and or feasibility of the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction:</strong> "This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement." The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 622110.<br /><br /><strong>Background.</strong> The search for the cause of an identified cancer cluster is often fruitless due to the existence of multiple exposure sources, lack of historical exposure data, and a mobile population. When the cancer in question has no known cause, the challenge is even greater, as in the polycythemia vera (PV) cluster recently identified in northeastern Pennsylvania (1). The cluster area is roughly 200 square miles, bounded by Hazleton in the north and Tamaqua in the south, and has a long record of mining, industrial, and hazardous waste releases to the environment, both historical and ongoing. Many of the releases are associated either directly or indirectly with the mining of anthracite coal. Although anthracite coal is no longer actively mined in the area, previous surface and underground mining activities (from the 1880s through the 1960s) have left large residuals of coal refuse (culm). The coal refuse has been used to fuel fluidized bed combustion (FBC) cogeneration power plants, six of which have been in operation in the cluster area region since the early 1990s. Over the years, abandoned underground and surface mines have been used as a convenient way to dispose of a variety of industrial contaminants (e.g. McAdoo &amp; Associates Site) and, more recently, ash from the FBC plants. Local residents and physicians in the cluster area are especially concerned about the elevated number of PV cases because of the nearby Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites (McAdoo Associates, Eastern Diversified Metals, and Tonolli Corp), and a waste-coal power plant (NEPCO). ATSDR is currently funding projects that will evaluate the surface water outflow from the McAdoo Site, and test soil, water, and indoor air at current and past residences of PV patients for environmental contaminants and radiation. Potential pathways of environmental exposure could include air inhalation, drinking water consumption, food ingestion, skin contact or a combination of exposure routes. Studying each of these pathways may be necessary to identify any empirical evidence that would suggest a correlation between the pathway and the incidence of PV in the tri-county area. The focus of the proposed work is on potential sources, pathways and exposures associated air and drinking water. ATSDR is currently compiling a data warehouse of all available environmental data from the cluster area (the PAPV Data Warehouse), which will be made available to the contractor. ATSDR will also assist the contractor in obtaining additional documents or data that are deemed relevant to this work from local, state and federal agencies.
<p>This exposure assessment analysis is an integral part of a comprehensive ATSDR public health response investigating the occurrence, trends, and associated risk factors of PV and other MyeloProliferative Diseases (MPDs), not only in the cluster area in Pennsylvania, but also on a national level. The data collected by ATSDR as a result of this work will allow us to better respond to cancer clusters with suspected environmental origins. In addition, our understanding of the etiology of MPDs and other hematological cancers will be greatly enhanced leading to improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong> To (1) examine the hydrogeology of the project area to evaluate relationships between present and past PV case residences in the cluster area and the sources of potable water (publicly owned water supplies, privately owned water supplies and the aquifers that supply private residential wells) used in these areas, (2) estimate the current and past exposures of study area residents to specific air pollutants from local and regional sources, and (3) address the informational needs of the community and establish regular lines of communication with the Community Action Committee on issues related to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements.</strong> 1. Cluster area hydrogeology and sources of potable water. This work will include a comprehensive review of existing studies, data and other information on the hydrogeology of the cluster area; identification of current and past sources of municipal and private drinking water throughout the cluster area, and the relationship of common drinking water sources to PV patient-occupied residences; evaluation of available water testing data to assess the quality of drinking water in the cluster area at the present time, and when possible, during specific time periods in the past (back to 1950) to determine whether specific contaminants are/were present in water supplies used in cluster areas; and field testing such as core sampling, tracer studies, and water analysis to fill gaps identified in the above work.</p>
<p>2. Air Pollution Exposure Assessment. This work will evaluate the present and past exposures of cluster-area residents to specific air pollutants from local and regional sources. Specific tasks include identification and characterization of air pollution sources, atmospheric dispersion modeling and analyses, air pollutant monitoring, and recommendations for supplemental work needed to fill gaps identified in the review.</p>
<p>3. Communications with Community Representatives. This effort will require working closely with the local communities, and addressing their informational needs by establishing regular lines of communication with the Community Action Committee (CAC) on issues related to the project.</p>

<p>NIST requires an integrated glove box system for depositing, processing, and testing of organic photovoltaic films and devices in an anhydrous nitrogen environment (&lt;1 ppm O2 and H2O). The system must consist of seven (7) glove boxes connected by vacuum antechambers. The vendor will supply five (5) of the glove boxes along with the integrated equipment listed in the following paragraphs, and connect them to two (2) MBraun glove boxes that already exist at NIST. The vendor must disconnect the 2 existing NIST boxes from each other and reconnect them to the 5 new glove boxes to complete the new 7-box system. Each glove box must be controlled by a programmable logic controller with a touch screen interface and have independent, regeneratable purifier systems. Two of the glove boxes must be compatible with the use of halogenated solvents. The glove boxes will be chamber locked to allow transfer of samples between boxes through the antechambers while avoiding any oxygen or water exposure or transmission of solvent between boxes. Glove boxes with computer controlled equipment will have an integrated computer display and mouse/keyboard attached to the corner of the glove box accessible to the glove box user. All instruments required to accomplish the following activities will be supplied and integrated by the vendor (except as noted) including all required feedthroughs.</p>
<p>The first glove box will require a high-performance spin coater, static-free analytical balance for measuring powders, and a heater-shaker for mixing and dissolving solutions. The second box will contain a high-precision, programmable hot-plate and a vacuum oven for annealing samples with highly accurate temperature control. The third glove box will include a high-throughput capability of electrical and photovoltaic testing of devices. This box will require the following instruments: a semi-automated probe station with a motorized stage and a video camera microscope for mounting and testing devices; a computer-controllable, high-precision semiconductor parameter analyzer with multiple source measure units for electrically testing devices; a dielectric and impedance spectrometer and test interface for frequency testing of devices; a 1000W solar simulator with high-uniformity illumination and AM1.5 spectrum output; a computer controlled dual channel source measure unit with multichannel scanner for high throughput current voltage characterization of photovoltaic device arrays; and a computer-controlled, optical fiber-based broadband spectrometer for measuring the absorbance of photovoltaic films and characterizing the spectrum output of the solar simulator.

If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

NIST has need for a linescale comparator that would meet the following requirements:

1.	The linescale comparator (system) must measure the spacing between lines on the surface of length standards and artifacts such as meter bars or grid plates.  The maximum spacing between lines to be measured will be at least 1m for one dimensional artifacts, and 300 mm for two dimensional artifacts.  Only measurement along one axis is required.  Two dimensional (2D) artifacts may be aligned manually to bring lines to be measured into proper alignment for the instrument, and the instrument must be capable of measuring lines offset from the central axis of a 2D artifact by  75 mm.

2.	The system must include facilities to mount artifacts for minimum sag, align artifacts to the measurement axis, detect lines with an optical microscope, and measure the spacing between lines using optical interferometry with evacuated beam paths.  During operation the instrument must maintain the artifact at a constant temperature of 20  0.003 C, and in a clean environment at the level of  class 10 or better.

3.	The system must accept artifacts with maximum dimensions at least 1050 mm long, 300 mm wide, and 75 mm tall.  The artifact may be constructed from a variety of materials, including glass, fused quartz, Zerodur, Invar, or steel, and the maximum artifact mass shall be at least 6 kg.  The minimum line width for lines to be measured shall be greater than or equal to 100 nm, and the minimum line spacing greater than or equal to 500 nm.  The lines may appear bright or dark relative to background in a reflectance microscope.

4.	The instrument must be able to measure the spacing between two lines separated by approximately 1000 mm, with an uncertainty less than 35 nm with a 95% confidence level.

a. Computed tomography capacity to generate high resolution d-dimensional reconstructions at the macromolecular up to the fine subcellular level of resolution.  Computed tomography can reveal structures and relationships not apparent by other techniques
b.	Time-saving capability to store and rapidly access operation settings for different users and applications
c.	Low magnification, high contrast imaging with a wide field of view to facilitate area selection for higher magnification viewing and for acquisition of low magnification images for analysis.
d.	Automated montage generation, which is very useful for morphometric studies and can save many hours of user time
e.	Automatic adjustment of brightness with magnification changes, making viewing and image acquisition more efficient
f.	Multiple exchangeable specimen rod tips, allowing exchange of specimens without disturbing orientation for re-examination of specimens, and 5-specimen holder for rapid specimen comparison
g.	Lab6 filament, which has greatly increase lifetime, minimizing down-time for filament changes.	
h.	Must offer installation support and training of SerialEM and IMOD through the JEOL APPs Division for a total of one (1) week (five (5) business days including travel).	
All responses should clearly specify that the vendor is interested in providing a complete JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscope System.

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscope System that can meet NHLBIs minimum requirements, NHLBI may conduct a competitive procurement.  If at least two qualified small business are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-side.

<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only. CMS intends to issue a modification to the University of Minnesota under its Medicare and Medicaid Research and Demonstration (MRAD) Task Order Contract (TOC). The MRAD TOCs were competitively awarded in 2005 under the procedures of FAR 16.505, multiple awards, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contracts. CMS intends to modify Contract HHSM-500-2005-00027I/Task Order 0003, which was also competitively awarded on September 29, 2008. This effort will allow the contractor to enhance customer service and training to the research community.
<p>This modification will require the contractor to provide the same quality and level of services to other federal agencies who want to learn how to use CMS data for projects relating to Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). In summary, this modification will enhance ResDAC's help desk, training, and outreach functions designed to familiarize researchers in how to obtain and use CMS data for CER. It will encompass the provision of technical assistance and education to all other federal agency employees via a ResDAC maintained website, a knowledgeable Assistance Desk team, and academic faculty and staff who will provide outreach to the research community at national conferences.</p>
<p>This effort will be performed within the current Period of Performance. The Contracting Officer has determined that the most appropriate contract type is Cost Plus Fixed-Fee.</p>

<DESC>Proposer's Day Announcement
<p>MOIRE - Membrane Optic Imager Real-Time Exploitation<br />Tactical Technology Office<br />Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers' Day in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (DARPA BAA 10-51) for a new program to develop a large, diffractive optics membrane and associated deployment and support structures, and communications equipment for use in a geosynchronous orbit-based telescope.  The MOIRE Proposer's Day will be held 0730 -1700 EST on March 12, 2010, at the Westfields Washington Dulles Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. The Proposers' Day is intended to introduce the research and development community to the program vision, goals and objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The Proposer's Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</p>
<p>The objective of the MOIRE program is to provide persistent, real-time, tactical video to the war fighter.  Development of diffractive membrane optics may facilitate low-cost geosynchronous imaging.  A 10-meter diffractive membrane is currently envisioned for a Phase III flight demonstration.  All designs must be traceable to an operational 20-meter system providing  24/7 visible NIIRS 3.5+ coverage over denied areas with at least a 1 Hz rate, FOV &gt; 100 km^2, field of regard &gt; 10^8 km^2 with a designed cost not to exceed $500M a copy after initial NRE.  This set of requirements is referred to as the operational Design Reference Mission (DRM).</p>
<p>Upon release of the BAA, DARPA will seek complete balanced innovative system-oriented proposals that address all the following important technical factors:   <br />[1] Large low cost, lightweight, deployable, diffractive membrane optics for geosynchronous orbit imaging systems.<br />[2] Near real time image stabilization and tactical geolocation knowledge<br />[3] A telescope design that increases spectral bandwidth<br />[4] Stability and dynamics of the large structure in geosynchronous orbit<br />[5] Target motion detection capability for highway speeds</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a MOIRE Proposers' Day that will: (a) Introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the program vision and objectives; (b) Explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) Promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the program goals. The Proposer's Day will include overview presentations by Government personnel in the morning and 10-15 minute one (organization)-on-one sessions with the Program Manager in the afternoon. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical.</p>
<p>Registration is limited by the venue capacity. To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of three persons per organization (not per division). Early registration is strongly recommended. The registration cutoff date is 11:00 AM ET, March 9, 2010.</p>
<p>The registration website is www.schafertmd.com/conference/moire.   Details including registration, agenda, meeting location, meals, parking and lodging will be provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>MOIRE Proposer's Day Details:</p>
<p>Time: 		March 12, 2010, 7:30am-5:00pm<br />Location: 	Westfields Washington Dulles Marriott<br />14750 Conference Center Drive<br />Chantilly, Virginia 20151</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.</span></strong><br /><strong>This effort is being pursued under an existing Agency contract.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 39 is to obligate an additional $6,000 in funding to the current $79,000 in support of Work Assignment (WA 2-201). The period of performance for this work assignment will be from July 29, 2009 though September 30, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 2-201 of Contract EP-C-05-046 will have the contractor assist EPA in providing ways to increase information sharing and improve collaboration between EPA Regions, EPA Headquarters and the Indian Health Service (IHS) working on Clean Water Indian Set Aside (CWISA) projects using ARRA funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Total funding for the task order remains $83,631.54. The period of performance for this task order is now from May 6, 2009 though May 31, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As stated in the synopsis for the initial task order, this task order is for the development and production of outreach materials to support the implementation of the ARRA. The &lsquo;green reserve' provisions place an emphasis on certain types projects that also support EPA's goals under our existing Sustainable Infrastructure Initiative. The materials to be developed are to promote awareness of these provisions to 1) encourage the submission of project proposals that meet the criteria, 2) encourage amendments to existing projects which make them more sustainable, and 3) to continue the emphasis on sustainable projects and practices throughout implementation of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System has a requirement to utilize unique facilities and experienced personnel for continued retinal research.It is the Government's intention to solicite and negotiate only with this source. This is not a solicitation; it is a notice of intent to sole source a requirement. Inquires /information received after established deadline of March 5, 2010 at 1200P EST shall not be considered. The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. the Government does not intend to pay for information solicited. This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.1. Identification of the service/department and the transaction/requisition #:The VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation (CIVR) is developing bioengineering therapies to improve the quality-of-life of visually impaired patients. The core mission of the CIVR is to develop an implantable retinal prosthesis that will be used to enhance vision in patients with retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration.2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved:The CIVR is requesting a contract with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) for specialized implantation surgeries and stimulation safety experiments, in support of the core CIVR mission, development of an implantable, configurable, biocompatible retinal prosthesis. The contract will enable CIVR, to collaborate with a highly skilled MEEI-based retinal surgeon to carry out approved experimental protocols at the VABHS.3. Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):The long-term goal of the Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation is to implant our retinal prosthesis into the eyes of veteran patients.  This will require FDA approval; an application is planned for 2014.  It is required by the FDA that the CIVR first demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the retinal implant device in animal studies.  This effort requires the development of surgical implantation techniques for subretinal electrode arrays in alternative retinal prosthesis designs.  The purpose of this contract is to pay for the effort and support of a highly skilled and specialized retinal surgeon who is based at MEEI.  The surgeon will carry out the development of new implantation techniques for subretinal electrode arrays according to approved animal surgical protocols at the VABHS.  The ability to safely implant electrode arrays of sufficient size so as to allow a wide field of view and avoid tunnel vision in human patients receiving the prosthesis is of the utmost importance to the future development and clinical success of the CIVR.  It is likely that future human recipients of the retinal implant will be most helped by restoration of both wide-field vision, and of moderate-acuity, more central vision, e.g. for the purpose of recognizing faces.  The MEEI has developed surgical methods for implanting  long but sparse stimulating electrode arrays in the subretinal space, and for implanting large arrays subtending a wide field of view  and, for implanting both types of arrays simultaneously During the subsequent 4 Option Periods, trials must continue, to perfect and test the longevity of subretinal devices using the techniques developed. The value of this service to the CIVRs effort to develop a safe and functioning retinal implant lies in the highly specialized skills of the MEEI surgeon and the support personnel. The total cost for the Initial Contract Period (Apr. 1, 2010  Sept. 30, 2010) is expected to be over $25,000 and less than $75,000 The expected aggregate total of the base and all option periods will be over $350,000.4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:The purpose of this contract is to pay for the continued surgeries and experiments on the part of MEEI personnel, and to develop large subretinal electrode array implantation techniques at the VABHS under approved animal protocols.  This effort is essential to the future success of the retinal prosthesis that is the core of the CIVR mission.  The CIVR has worked with MEEI for over six years to develop these groundbreaking surgical techniques, and this has resulted in the implantation of very large electrode arrays using a minimally invasive, ab externo approach.  This outstanding result has to our knowledge not been achieved by any of the other research groups working in the area of retinal prosthesis implantation.   While vitreoretinal surgeons and their support teams are available in many locales, very few have attempted the CIVRs preferred surgical approach for subretinal implantation, and these skills take years to hone.  The selection of any surgeon other than the one with whom the CIVR is currently collaborating would be a major setback for the CIVR and likely would eliminate the possibility of success for the CIVRs RR&D-funded project, due to the steep learning curve involved. For these reasons, no market survey was conducted.6. Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:  As required by FAR Subpart 5.2, an intent to sole source notice was published in the FBO on Feb 26,2010.7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:Contracting officer will determine a price reasonableness finding. *8. Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted: No market survey was conducted (see #5 and #6 above). *9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as - an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available. See # 5 above.* 10. A Iisting of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in the acquisition:To be determined.*11. A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future:The specialized nature of this requirement dictates the use of other than full and open competition.This department does not have barriers to competition. the researc focus of the department is highly specific. This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible. POC Robert O'learycontract specialist Email robert.oleary@va.gov Deadline Mar 5,2010 1200P EST

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-03-H-5000/0043 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

<p>For this contract action, the NLRB will not consider or accept a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a Hotel. The RFQ does not require Event Planning Services or 3rd Party Event Planning or Consultant Services.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:</strong> The NLRB intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The objective of the NLRB is to select the proposal that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the requirements. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NLRB. All proposals must confirm in their offer that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong> The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Capabilities. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Technical: <br /></strong>(a) Proposal will be evaluated for ability to provide all contract requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />(b) Lodging Rooms: their size, layout, quality and appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/WIFI connections).<br />(c) Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session and breakout rooms, location and office space; the atmosphere of the meeting rooms (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking, exercise facility and business center; cash bar and menu selections and A/V equipment.<br />(d) Location: Walking distance to a variety of restaurants, entertainment and shopping areas, commuting ease from major Airport, safety of hotel neighborhood, and located in the downtown Atlanta, Georgia area.</p>
<p><strong>2. Past Performance:&nbsp; </strong>The contractor shall provide a list of three recent contracts that exemplify accomplished activities related to or similar to the activities identified in the SOW. The contact information for each reference shall include:</p>
<p>- Contract Value<br />- Agency/Company Name<br />- Type of Services Provided<br />- List of any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor's corrective action.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3. Proposed Total Price</strong> should be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. Pricing should be provided for the following contract line items (CLIN):</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 0001</strong> Hotel Lodging for four nights for 150 and 1 night for 35 in accordance with the Solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>CLIN 002</strong> Meeting Space Rental to include one office; one general session room for 150 people; six break-out rooms for 25 people as described above.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 003</strong> Food and Beverages - Continental Breakfast for four (4) days; mid-morning beverage replenishment for four (4) days; afternoon refreshments for four (4); and an Awards Reception with Hor d'oeurves and cash bar for 150 people one evening in accordance with the Solicitation.</p>

<p><strong>CLIN 005</strong> Miscellaneous Expenses (e.g., extra AV equipment, copying of papers, Office telephones; internet connections, etc.)</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br /><br />In case of a receipt of a large number of proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award.<br />&nbsp;<br />First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition. <br /><br />a. If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />&nbsp;<br />b. If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.<br /><br />c. After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.<br /><br />The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p><strong>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow this format or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>If a hotel contract is necessary, it shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams, and square footage and menus. Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit a separate technical and cost proposal that addresses the Statement of Work. Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m.. EST on March 16, 2010 via email to Delfina St Clair at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov or by regular U.S. mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word 2003.

<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:</strong> The NLRB intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The objective of the NLRB is to select the proposal that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the requirements. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB. All offerors must confirm in their proposal that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong> The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Capabilities. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Technical:</strong> <br />(a) Proposal will be evaluated for ability to provide all contract requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />(b) Lodging Rooms: their size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/WIFI connections).<br />(c) Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session and breakout rooms, location and office space; the atmosphere of the meeting rooms (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking, exercise facility and business center; cash bar and menu selections and A/V equipment.<br />(d) Location: Walking distance to a variety of restaurants, entertainment and shopping areas, commuting ease from major Airport, safety of hotel neighborhood, and located in the downtown San Diego, California area.</p>

<p>- Contract Value<br />- Agency/Company Name<br />- Type of Services Provided<br />- List of any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor's corrective action.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3. Proposed Total Price</strong> should be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. Pricing should be provided for the following contract line items (CLIN):</p>

<p><strong>CLIN 005</strong> Miscellaneous Expenses (e.g., extra AV equipment, copying of papers, Office telephones; internet connections, etc.)</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br /><br />In case of a receipt of a large number of proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award. <br /><br />First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />&nbsp;<br />a. If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />&nbsp;<br />b. If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.<br /><br />c. After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.<br /><br />The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE SUBMISSION:&nbsp; </strong>Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow this format or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>If a hotel contract is necessary, it shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams, and square footage and menus. Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit a separate technical and cost proposal that addresses the Statement of Work. Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m.. EST on March 17, 2010 via email to Delfina St Clair at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov or by regular mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word 2003. Proposals may be shipped or mailed to the following address:</p>
<p>National Labor Relations Board<br />Acquisitions Management Branch<br />1099 14th Street, NW, Room 7750<br />Washington, DC 20570<br />Attention: Delfina St Clair</p>
<p>The BOP Contracting Officer will serve as point of contact (POC) for inquiries and clarifications.</p>
<p>To the extent prospective Offerors have questions or comments regarding this Solicitation, they are to be submitted in writing via email to the Contract Office at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov by 12:00 noon EST on March 8, 2010. At the NLRB's discretion, the NLRB may provide written responses to the questions or comments as appropriate. Any such responses will be posted as an Amendment to the Solicitation.</p>

The Department of Defense relies for its success upon a healthy and high performing human workforce. The psychological health and fitness of the force is critical to effective functioning. Job stress, whether on deployments or at home, can lead to a range of physical and mental health problems.  It is essential then for DoD to understand the sources of stress on its workforce, the underlying psychophysical processes whereby health can be affected, and how to prevent and treat the ill-effects of stress. It is also important to understand the impact of policies and leadership on both stress and reactions to stress in the DoD workforce.

The DoD requires science-based knowledge regarding stress, resilience and psychological health of its workforce.  The Center for Technology and National Security Policy (CTNSP) can provide the professional scientific and research expertise needed to meet the goals of the project as outlined in Section 3, Objectives.  This calls for a professional research psychologist with extensive skills and background in the design and conduct of relevant research projects, as well as analyses of data and authoring of effective oral and written reports. This support will require technical/scientific expertise as well as an understanding of the national security environment and workforce, including military and civilian personnel.

None of these options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! Website. All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage! website. All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration's Road Inventory Program (RIP) is preparing for the fifth data collection cycle for the National Park Service (NPS) road network. Integral to this collection cycle, the FHWA will create approximately 81 RIP Reports for large parks and approximately 215 RIP Reports for small parks with parking only and small parks with parking and automated collected routes, for an approximate total of 296 reports on an estimated 5,000 miles of paved routes over three years. The TSR Group and EFLHD RIP were successful in developing a system that efficiently and accurately created the RIP Report. Computer scripts, routines, codes, and sub-processes were developed and used by TSR in the creation of past RIP Reports. Therefore, EFLHD intends to enter into a contract with The TSR Group to procure services to process, compute, calculate, and/or manipulate data collected by FHWA and deliver it in the form of RIP Reports.

The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished), and incidentals to perform all work necessary to plant trees in the areas specified.

No site visit will be held as there is no way to access the area at this time due to the amount of snow.  Once the snow is gone is when the work will begin.

Once Award is made the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and the Contracting Officer (CO) will work closely with the Contractor to ensure that everything is ready when the snow is gone and the work can start.

Aquarium Maintenance
For
The National Institutes of Health
Clinical Center



1.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  

The Clinical Center Complex of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The Clinical Center is the hospital of the NIH consisting of 234 inpatient beds, 76-day hospital stations, outpatient clinics, diagnostic and treatment areas, and public waiting areas.  Adjacent to the hospital facilities are research laboratories.  The complex consists of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center (Magnuson Center) that covers 661,600 sq. ft. and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (Hatfield Center) that covers 698,263 sq. ft.  The Magnuson Center is fifty years old and had a substantial addition completed in 1981 which is called the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF).  The ACRF is a fourteen-floor structure which houses clinics and research laboratories on twelve floors.  The first and second levels of the ACRF houses clinical services including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), surgery, transfusion medicine and laboratory medicine.   

The Hatfield Center opened in 2005 and houses the inpatient units, day hospitals, additional clinics, admissions, pharmacy, social work, rehabilitation medicine departments, staff use areas, support areas and research laboratories.  The Hatfield Center is a seven-story structure with a central large open atrium at the core of the building that connects four separate sectors that house occupants.  Patients are housed on levels 1, 3, 5 and 7 on the southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest sectors of the facility.  Levels 2, 4, and 6 are interstitial mechanical space except for small clusters of offices on the east and west elevator lobbies and atrium portions of the facility.  Research laboratories are located on levels B3, B2, 1, 3 and 5.  The laboratories lead to the southeast and southwest patient care units through distally placed elevator lobbies.


2.  SCOPE OF WORK

The responsibility of the contractor is to arrange healthy aquaria and maintain the livelihood and environment of the fish that inhabit the aquaria with oversight by the Clinical Centers Animal Care Program.  Currently, the Clinical Center requires maintenance on seventeen (17) aquaria to include 3 salt water aquaria and 14 freshwater aquaria.  The aquaria are located in various locations in the buildings; seven are in outpatient clinics in the ACRF, and the remainder in the inpatient areas of the Hatfield building. Maintenance agreements on aquaria have been in place in the Clinical Center since September 2000.  The aquaria were installed for patients, guests and staff of the Clinical Center and are intended to provide a sense of comfort in a research hospital setting.  The types of patients treated at the Clinical Center range from those who are incapacitated to those who are ambulatory. The aquaria play an important role in the patients comfort and the contractor needs to be willing and comfortable to engage patients as appropriate.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI10062 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-38 dated December 10, 2009. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a large-business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intend to procure Britelite Plus on a sole source basis with PerkinElmer Health Sciences. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) Britelite Plus Reporter Gene Assay System, 1000mL, #6016769, qty-60; (5 each per month for 12 months). Britelite Plus is an ultra-sensitive luciferase reporter gene assay system for the quantitation of firefly luciferase expression in mammalian cells. This system is especially suitable for use in 96-, 384- or 1536-well microplate formats, as in use in the high-throughput environment, because of the short half-life of the reagents. The Britelite Plus is compatible with the luminescence detection technology currently in place with the lab. This technology is used for the detection of other substrates in different applications, so replacing it with another product would be extremely costly and inefficient. Any attempts to change reagents for this particular application at this point would provide results inconsistent with previously gathered data. In addition, the relevance of various projects would be harmed because of the incompatibility of new data with data from previous trial runs; comparison would prove impossible with a change in reagents at this point. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price and 2) capability to meet required specifications. Delivery shall be for 12 months from date of award. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders - Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; and FAR 32.703-2, Availability of Funds, FAR 52.232.33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Center Contractor Registration. In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201 (a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov prior to award during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:
HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month
VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of
service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR
4.173)
HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin
Luther
King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor
Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with
pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR
4174)
THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE
FOLLOWING:
1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage
determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide
executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.
Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at
a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than
$455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29
C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all
occupations
within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may
not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the
survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or
exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt
employees. For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs
duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer
Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage
rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this
wage
determination.
Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the
computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer
employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures,
including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing
or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on
and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of
computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).
2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:
If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night
differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm
and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a
Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not
overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).
HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to
employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working
with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of
sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black
powder
and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or
explosives.
Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance
operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.
A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position
that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary
materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of
the
employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and
the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being
used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance,
explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These
differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the
agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this
contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the
state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne
by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the
wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with
the
following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the
actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is
made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors
subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective
bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such
cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).
However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments,
and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or
commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by
the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of
the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance
costs.
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the
Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE
{Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee
which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the
work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such
unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.
Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished
the
fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be
initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted
class(es)
of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe
benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6
(C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF
1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in
order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed
wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no
authorized
representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to
the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of
employees
performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a
report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to
the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of
Labor,
for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies,
or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to
process
the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the
contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond
paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to
insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in
the
wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required
tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in the Asia Middle East Region, in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, OTI will focus its program on four main objectives in Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern Provinces: 1) improve public confidence and community-level perceptions of security, 2) improve institutional capabilities to engage the full range of rehabilitation needs for at-risk youth, 3) improve access to more reliable news and information on issues of local importance, 4) and carry out high impact community activities. Beginning priorities for the program will be supporting the safe and effective return of populations that is already underway to their communities of origin, followed quickly by recovery assistance and support to begin reconstituting a healthy social and political fabric. As the context develops, OTI will then begin assisting citizens in more political and social dimensions of the post-conflict transition process as opportunities emerge.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above in both countries. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media, stabilization, and peace-building activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of hiring for this position is to support OTI programs and the OTI Country Representative.</p>
<p><br />9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This is a middle management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem-solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants. S/he should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Middle East Regional Team and will be based in Colombo, Sri Lanka or another location in the Northern or Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka to be determined.</p>
<p>The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with United States Government (USG) agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting country representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required; and</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report directly to the Country Representative in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>

During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI plans to launch two new programs in the Asia Middle East Region, one in Sri Lanka, and one in Yemen.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, OTI will focus its program on four main objectives in Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern Provinces: 1) improve public confidence and community-level perceptions of security, 2) improve institutional capabilities to engage the full range of rehabilitation needs for at-risk youth, 3) improve access to more reliable news and information on issues of local importance, 4) and carry out high impact community activities. Beginning priorities for the program will be supporting the safe and effective return of populations that is already underway to their communities of origin, followed quickly by recovery assistance and support to begin reconstituting a healthy social and political fabric. As the context develops, OTI will then begin assisting citizens in more political and social dimensions of the post-conflict transition process as opportunities emerge.</p>
<p>In Yemen, OTI will initiate a program in support of USAID's broader Stabilization Through Development Strategy. USAID's overarching strategic goal in Yemen is: increased stability through targeted interventions in highly vulnerable areas. OTI's engagement will focus on relatively short-term development programming tailored to address the drivers of instability in specific areas of the country and to respond quickly and directly to the articulated needs and frustrations of communities in the most unstable areas. The location and number of areas of focus will be delineated over time and in coordination with Mission, interagency and donor colleagues.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above in both countries. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media, stabilization, and peace-building activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to the complex emergency in Sudan, OFDA <br />operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Khartoum, Sudan which is responsible for overseeing the $140 million portfolio of OFDA funding in Sudan during fiscal year 2009. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) is OFDA's principal humanitarian representative in Sudan and is located in Khartoum. The Senior Program Officer for Sudan supports the SHA by serving as OFDA's primary representative in Juba, Sudan, which is a post without permanent SHA presence. The Senior Program Officer will be responsible for monitoring OFDA programs and reporting on the humanitarian situation in southern Sudan, but may be called upon to assist in supporting OFDA programs in the Three Areas, the East and Darfur. The Senior Program Officer assists the SHA with assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationship, and facilitation of award management activities.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Senior Program Officer will work and live at the USAID Compound in Juba, Sudan and report to OFDA's Senior Humanitarian Advisor for Sudan. Under the guidance of the SHA, he/she will coordinate closely with USAID and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Sudan portfolios, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team. This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance. The Senior Program Officer will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) for all assigned awards. He/she may supervise up to two Foreign Service Nationals.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one Senior Program Officer for Sudan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA Senior Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction efforts throughout his/her area of responsibility (AOR). The Senior Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the region as needed.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines. The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as one of the principal contact points for OFDA in southern Sudan, and the Three Areas, the East and Darfur as needed, for humanitarian issues. Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with development assistance colleagues in the USAID Mission and/or US Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve a primary role in the development of OFDA's response and disaster risk reduction strategies in the AOR, ensure complimentarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.</p>
<p>&bull; Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, management oversight, and evaluation of OFDA response programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain regular contact with senior leadership within the humanitarian community and represent USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include, but is not limited to, UN agencies, International Organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), U.S. Government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in the AOR, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN - led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in AOR. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the Senior Humanitarian Advisor, Regional Coordinator, and other support staff current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; With guidance from the SHA, coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage all administrative functions at the field office level and coordinate travel for all humanitarian-related visitors, including VIPs.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Program Officer will report to OFDA's Senior Humanitarian Advisor for Sudan, located in Khartoum, and maintain close coordination with the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives. The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic. A component is considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component is of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that--</p>
<p>(1) Sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; or</p>
<p>(2) It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act; or</p>
<p>(B) The end product is a COTS item.</p>
<p>(4) "End product" means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under this contract for public use.</p>

<p>(A) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.</p>
<p>(B) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(C) Components of foreign origin of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>

Unless otherwise specified, this clause applies to all line items in the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of other end products in the Buy American Act--Balance of Payments Program Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying country end product or an SC/CASA state end product, the Contractor shall deliver a qualifying country end product or an SC/CASA state end product, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(d) The contract price does not include duty for end products or components for which the Contractor will claim duty-free entry.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (10 AUG 2005)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

<DESC>Questions and Answers.

Q- Will the contractor be responsible for running low voltage wire through walls of the HDI Federal Center, or shall GSA complete such wiring.

A- Yes the contractor is responsible for running the wire for the complete project, however, in the SOW it states that, All work shall be completed and performed in accordance with the best practices of the trade and in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local codes. Essentially this means that any wiring ran must conform to the requirements GSA has established for the building. Further, I want to reiterate that the SOW claims the Government has reserved the right to inspect and verify that the work is in compliance with federal, state, and local these local codes.  If for some reason you think these local codes/ requirements may potentially influence a response to this announcement, then I recommend obtaining these codes/ technical requirements on local cable and wiring code/ regulations from James Buehner, the Governments Technical Representative for this announcement.

16.f the content is owned by CFSAN, can and will CFSAN provide scoring templates and other technical information required to administer and score the instruments?  No, that's the contractors job.
17.Does CFSAN require any in-person meetings during the course of this contract?  No 
18.What are the minimum and maximum number of managers that would participate in 360 surveys per month?  The survey will not be administered monthly; there will be two groups, the second group about 5 months after the first group (no surveys will be administered June through August)
19.Approximately how many raters are expected to rate each manager?  It varies; 10 - 20 is probably a good average range 
20..Are there any specific reporting requirements other than what is indicated in paragraph 2 of the Deliverables section of the solicitation:  "A feedback report for each participant with numeric and qualitative feedback and highlights of highest and lowest scores?"  No  
21. How many competencies and survey items does CFSAN expect to include in the    360 survey? There are 6 umbrella scales and 43 questions, as well as an opportunity to provide additional comments at the end of each of the six sections.
22. How many open response (open-ended) survey items does CFSAN expect to include in the 360 survey?   6, as noted above.
23. Will managers participate in the 360 process more than once during the contract period?     
24. Was the CFSAN 360 Degree survey developed by a contractor?     No  
25. Is there an incumbent providing maintenance services now?   No   
26. Would the government setting this requirement aside for SDVOSB? No, this procurement is a total small business set aside.
27. the RFQ does not reference a cost proposal  projects like this typically involve a set up fee to create the instrument online in our system, a per person fee for administration and producing the PDF report, and a fee for the hard copy color report  is this information adequate or would you like something else?    Provide a cost and technical proposal no longer than 5 pages via email to maryrose.nicol@fda.hhs.gov
28. Do you expect this to be a firm fixed price contract? Yes 
29. Does the survey use a 5 point scale or a 7 point scale?   6 point 
30. Will the final survey be provided by HHS?   Yes  
31. Are their mechanisms in place to ensure manager participation?   A CFSAN manager is collecting the names of the participants and raters however, beyond that; the rest is confidential and anonymous 
31.  Does the vendor have to host the survey or we will use a system currently in use by your organization to manage the process?  The contractor will host the survey.
32. On average, how many employees are included on (1) managers survey package. In most cases, a standard practice is to have five to 10 employees who will rate a manager, i.e. the manager (1), his/her manager/supervisor/leader (1), peers (3), and direct-reports (5). Knowing the average number of participants will help set the cost for the 175 estimated packages. Each organization is different in terms of how many employees participate per manager. Could you share with me number of participants per average circle/cluster on past 360 packages? A rule of thumb is that the more people rating the more time it takes.   While the exact number varies, 10 - 20 is an average range for raters. 
33.  For clarity, some software will generate a report, while others need to have someone manually run the data and numbers. Please share with me whether the vendor will be responsible for (1) compiling all of the data, numbers, etc. and submitting a report based on their findings or (2) the 360 Degree software generates a report that we are responsible in forwarding to the managers?   We do not have 360 Degree software; the vendor is responsible for compiling the data used to generate the report.
    35.   Has the survey been administered online before or does the contractor program and host the survey?   The contractor programs and hosts the online survey. 
36.  How many people over a year's time do you anticipate surveying?   About 175 
37. Will any financial incentive be offered to encourage participation?    No
38. Is it correct that no cost information or hourly wage rates are requested at this time? A cost proposal for the project must be submitted.
39. Is the implementation to be delivered in English only?   Yes 
40  Is there an HRIS data feed that will be made available to HumanR that captures key information (first name, last name, email address) of each of the participants and their raters?   No; this information will be transmitted via e-mail from FDA to the vendor.
41. What are the N sizes of the groups throughout the 12  18 month process?   There will likely be two groups throughout the year; the first with about 50 participants and the second with about 100.  If necessary, a third group of about 25 participants will be evaluated. 
42. Does the HR POC wish to have access to the Admin site to monitor response rates?   No
43. Provide them with a printed copy (color, bound, and sealed)  is this something that HumanR would provide or does the CFSAN HR Team plan to print and deliver internally?  The vendor will provide the printed report. 
44. Are reports to be delivered directly to the participants?   Via email as a PDF attachment?   No.  All reports, including the electronic reports, will be sent to one HR manager in FDA. 
45. Does CFSAN have a standard report format or are you open to following our standard report format (which can be customized)?  We do not have a standard report format.
46. What is the desired launch date of the first group?   About 1 month after the vendor is selected.
47   How long would you like each group to be live?   At least 2 weeks. 
48. Will there be overlap in groups participating?   No; there will be a finite end date for each group.
49. We typically provide our 360 reports on a per report basis (fixed rate/per report) as opposed to an hourly rate.  Is this something you are willing to accommodate?   Yes 
50. Would you be interested in having us apply under the MOBIS contract for 360 (formerly Schedule 69) for this type of service (as we have this capability)?  You can apply with your GSA Rates, however, this is an open market requirement.
51. Did an outside vendor provide a web-based online 360 system for your Leadership 360 program? No, this is a new requirement.
52.  The scoring criterion in your solicitation is silent regarding cost.  What part will cost play in your evaluation of the responses. This solicitation is based on best value then cost.

The response date remains unchanged.

<a href="mailto:gregory.sies@navy.mil">Gregory Sies - Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following changes/clarifications to the referenced synopsis:
1. The SF330 due date remains unchanged at no later than 2:00 pm on Monday, March 12, 2010.
2. To amend and provide additional clarifications for Section A - Submittal Requirements: The page limitation is not applicable to covers, section tabs or any charts.
3. To respond to RFI's received
1.  In regard to Section B Selection Criteria, Criteria 1 and Criteria 2, is the referenced "over $1 Million" referring to professional services or construction value?  
Government Response: Total Value of Construction
2.  In regard to section 2 statement of architect/engineering services, please define life safety as well as construction support services.  
Government Response:  Please refer to the NFPA (National Fire Protection Agency) 101: Life Safety for a definition of "life safety". "Construction support services" may include, but are not limited to: design review, inspection of work in place to confirm compliance with design, providing technical expertise for challenges faced in construction, providing government estimates for change orders, scope development for change orders, and any other studies, reports, or investigations required to adequately provide construction support to the government construction management office.
3.  What would our role be in support of the MILCON projects listed in the Statement of Architect/Engineering services?
Government Response: Please see Section 2 - Statement of Architect/Engineering Services, Subparagraph #3 for some of the examples of MILCON Projects Support. For example; 1391 planning documentation preparation, development of Request for Proposal (RFP) packages for Design Build projects or fully designed plans and specifications, for the water / wastewater treatment system program, including construction support services for new and existing facilities.
4.  Criteria 1 as I understand it is Section E (Resumes) - are you looking for points of contact /references for each project on every resume?
Government Response: No, however, please refer to Criteria #3 - Past Performance where you will have to provide the appropriate points of contact.
5.  The Solicitation notes that the SF330 is limited to 30 single-sided pages, 8.5 X 11.  Does this page restriction include the cover, section tabs or backs?  
Government Response: The page limitation is not applicable to covers, section tabs, or charts.
6.  On page 4 of 10 of the Solicitation, Paragraph #5 states that the Org chart is to be attached to section C.   Does that mean the Org chart is not included in the 30 page restriction and is only an attachment reference in the SF330 document? 
Government Response: Refer to Synopsis Section A - Submittal Requirements, SF330, Part 1, Section D: Organization Chart: ".This chart shall not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation."
7.  Also, last year, we submitted a SF330 for the Large Civil work project.   We received authorization from the contracting officer to go over the 30 page restriction.   Will this solicitation be lenient on the page count or will it be reason for disqualification?
Government Response: The 30 page limitation applies to this procurement. Any extra pages will not be considered.
8.  If the Org. chart does not count in the page count, may it be 11 X 17 page size?
Government Response: Yes. Synopsis Section A - Submittal Requirements, SF330, Part 1, Section D: Organization Chart: ".This chart must be affixed to the submittal to avoid separation in handling."
9.  SF330 Part 1 is limited to 30-single-sided pages, 8.5 x 11 pages.  After presenting ten projects, at least 10+ resumes and the required standard forms, there is no room for presenting additional qualifications in Section H although the solicitation describes numerous items that must be addressed.  Please reconsider the page restriction.  We recommend a 50 page limitation.
Government Response: Please see government response on Mod #1, answer to question #5. The submittal requirements remain unchanged.
10.  How should Criteria 8 be included as "a separate file" - should it be bound separately or included as an appendix?
Government Response: Bound separately.
11.  It appears that under Criteria 1 you require resumes from key team members illustrating the items listed under that Criteria with no more than 5 projects for each resume.  It also appears that under Criteria 2 you require project descriptions illustrating the items listed under that Criteria.  In both cases, are we to only provide project descriptions and resumes (found in Section F and E, respectively) or are we also to provide qualifications in a narrative form regarding these items in Section H?

Government Response: 1. Criteria #1 is specifically referencing to professional qualifications which are resumes of individual key personnel in the SF330. 2. Criteria #2 is asking to provide specialized team experience which needs to be stated in SF330 Section F. Please review/address each criteria accordingly.
12.  Criteria 3, Past Performance d) Provide copies of awards and letters of appreciation/commendation.  Are these to be included in Section H for Criteria 3?  If so are these included in the page count?
Government Response: Yes, it is included in Section H, and the page limitation does not apply to Criteria #3 - Past Performance. 13.  For Criteria 1 and 2 the submission requirements ask for projects completed within the last five years.  Does this mean the construction is complete and beneficial occupancy is accepted or the design-build package is complete?  Please consider projects substantially complete for those that are designed and constructed over a long period and where the success of the overall project can be shown.
Government Response: Completion is measured by the Contract Completion Date. 
14.  Is there a specific percentage of the contract value that is required to be set aside for the various small business categories?
Government Response: Please Refer to FAR 19.704 - Subcontracting Plan Requirements, and Criteria 8: Commitment to Small Business in the Synopsis.
15.  Is there a target goal percentage of the contract value that is desired?
Government Response: Please Refer to FAR 19.704 - Subcontracting Plan Requirements, and Criteria 8: Commitment to Small Business in the Synopsis.
16.  The subcontracting goals identified on page 8 for SBE/HUBZone/SDBE/WOSB/SDVOSB total more than 100%.  Please clarify the intended distribution of work to small businesses in light of your responses to questions 1 and 2 above.
Government Response: Refer to Criteria 8: "*NOTE: The Government acknowledges that the percentages under the socioeconomic concerns (WOSB, SDB, Hub-Zone, VOSB and SDVOSB) may NOT total to equal "all small business goals," as some small businesses may qualify for more than one small business category."
17.  Does the minimum font size of "no smaller than Times New Roman 10-point" stated on page 4 of 10, apply to graphics and tables?
Government Response: No, the font restrictions do not apply to graphics and tables, but they must be legible.

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

i. Capability to Perform
ii.Past Performance
iii.Price

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more imprortant than cost or price.

Contractor/Offerors Past Performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor/offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Contractors/Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three (3) prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">T</span>his Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research and budgetary and planning purposes only.</em></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) requests information to develop practical and sustainable models for meeting the primary objectives of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) in an information environment dominated by digital technologies. This work should explore what is possible within the current legislative framework for the FDLP as well as suggest specific changes to the law where the existing language is found to be inhibiting the practical exercise of the FDLP's purpose and goals.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The desire for an informed and impartial consultant to perform this study has broad support across the depository library community and reflects the goals of a recommendation made by the Depository Library Council after its Spring 2009 meeting. The development of practical and sustainable models for the FDLP in the digital era is a necessary next step in building further consensus among all stakeholders and ensuring the public has systematic and secure access to Federal Government information in the 21st century and beyond.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<span style="COLOR: black">Information received by GPO on this effort will be used to help determine the future state of the FDLP and may be used to plan for and/or seek legislative or administrative changes to the Program. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) is continuing the strategic planning process for the future of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Identified goals are to determine a sustainable model or models for delivering FDLP collections and services to the American public in the online Federal Government information environment.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</span></span></strong>The use of digital information technologies by FDLP libraries; the general public; and Federal agencies, to publish and provide citizen-centric, dynamic, and participatory e-government services, presents opportunities for unprecedented access to Government information. Fundamental aspects of ensuring that the American public has current and future access to Federal information, however, are hindered by the existing structure of the FDLP, based primarily on a 19th century model of print production and distribution. To be relevant in the electronic era, the FDLP must develop other working models to fulfill its programmatic mission and outline the roles that each of the depository partners play in making Government information widely and publicly accessible.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;GPO and various library communities have devoted considerable attention to the study and discussion of these important issues since the early 1990s. From GPO's 1996 Report to Congress to the recently published Ithaka Report, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Documents for a Digital Democracy</em>: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">A Model for the Federal Depository Library Program in the 21st Century</em>, substantial work has been done by a variety of stakeholders to address many key issues surrounding public access to Government information in the digital age. There is broad consensus in the depository library community on the values and principles of the FDLP.</p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">About the Federal Depository Library Program</span><span style="COLOR: black">:</span></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For more than 140 years, the GPO has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government's information, this Program involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Libraries designated as Federal depositories maintain these information products as part of their existing collections and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided through the FDLP.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">vision</strong> of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide Government information when and where it is needed in order to create an informed citizenry and an improved quality of life.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">mission</strong> of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide for no-fee ready and permanent public access to Federal Government information, now and for future generations.</p>

Specific areas of focus will be discussed at the industry day although concepts that enable future space control capabilities in the area of performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability and affordability goals, or which enhance performance or significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies, are of particular interest. Areas of interest include activities that will provide benefit to Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS), Offensive Counterspace (OCS) mission areas, as well as, Enabling Command and Control. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS. DO NOT SEND A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. The Government may award classified or unclassified contracts as a result of this BAA. Offerors responding to this announcement are required to submit with a cover letter, an original and three copies of a technical paper. In addition to the hardcopy technical paper, please submit a PDF formatted copy on a CD diskette. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the following address: ATTN: Ms. Aine Nakai, SYSW/PK, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. If an offeror is interested in submitting a classified technical paper they must pre-coordinate with Mr. Jim Austin at 310-416-1645 or Mr. Reginald King at 310-416-1578 before submitting a technical paper. The applicable NAICS code for this solicitation is 541712 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. This acquisition is unrestricted; full and open competition is anticipated. Prospective offerors are to submit annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Offerors can complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Specific Technical Paper Instructions: (1) Cover letter. A cover letter shall accompany each technical paper. The cover letter should reference this BAA number.

The technical papers shall be limited to 15 pages, single spaced, double-sided, 8.5 by 11-inch pages.

The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. Multiple technical papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the technical paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those technical papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. The Government reserves the right to enter negotiations on any, all, part, or none of the papers received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Overall merits of the proposal, (2) Importance to Space Control programs, and (3) Affordability. Price, in the context of affordability of proposals versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Price will be evaluated and negotiated on proposals selected for award. No further evaluation criteria will be used. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Principle funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY11. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, SYSW/PK, Los Angeles AFB, CA: Ms. Aine Nakai, (310) 416-1732, email aine.nakai.ctr@losangeles.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The cost of preparing technical papers or proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The following is required for personnel nominated to attend the Industry Day on 2-3 Jun 2010. Each organization will be limited to four personnel, one of whom must be a security professional. For each person attending, a Personal Access Request (PAR) will be submitted IAW JAFAN 6/0 with required supporting documentation (i.e. JPAS or Scattered Castles printout, SF 86 updated and signed in 2010 and evidence of a local records check). All personnel submitted must meet Tier I standards IAW JAFAN 6/4 with no waivers and must be currently briefed to TS/SCI level. Organizations must have a TS/SCI accredited facility in order to receive, store, or process Industry Day and other related documentation. SYSW/AS will accept the use of a currently accredited SCIF for storage, etc. A CONOPS will be required identifying the SCIF ID number, Rooms to be used and how the information will be segregated/protected. Contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 for additional details regarding submission of PARs, facility CONOPS and accreditation of Information Systems for processing data. All nominations and documentation is due 22&nbsp;Mar 2010; late submittals will not be processed. Companies who currently have Special Access Programs (SAPs) sponsored by SYSW should contact Mr Jim Austin @ (310) 416-1645. This could eliminate or minimize the documentation required to attend the industry day. BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracts manager but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracts manager, Ms. Aine Nakai, (310) 416-1732. This BAA will remain open for nine months from time of release. There is no guarantee that awards will be made in each of the identified technical areas. The Government may make multiple awards in a technical area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and the available funding. Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the Government.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, & Engineering Center, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Beyond Clothing LLC, a small business located in Seattle, WA 98108. This is the second phase of evaluation.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The garments that are being purchased from Beyond Clothing are a variety of military clothing items that provide environmental protection. The following items are being procured:<BR>1. Enhanced Advantage BDU Blouse<BR>2. Enhanced Advantage BDU Pants<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>These items are made by Beyond CIothing only. Beyond Clothing participated in the development of these SOF garments and has the exclusive commercial sales rights to them. Consequently, they are the only commercial source for these items. In addition, Beyond Clothing has the ability to rapidly modify the design of these gaments. Our intention is to conduct two operational evaluations and then using the operational feedback, make adjustments to these garments and procure another round of test articles for evaluation.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A sources sought market survey (W911QY09SS0002) for approved military products was performed in MAR 09. Respondents were invited to a Vendor Day held at Natick on 30 APR 09 where products were exhibited to the APPS IPTs. These garments were developed for SOF applications which are very similar to tactical law enforcement. On 21 OCT 09, these products were selected by the APPS SWAT IPT, based on product characteristics and user priorities.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>These products are being procured as limited quantities of test articles for the planned APPS SWAT operational evaluations. Beyond has the capability to rapidly modify the design of these garments. Our intention is to procure a small quantity (QTY-30) of product to conduct initial operational evaluations (Phase I Completed) and then using the operational feedback from those evaluations, to make adjustments to these garments to improve their operational suitability and effectiveness. We will then procure another quantity (Phase II) of improved test articles for further evaluation. These items will be procured later as pricing for the modified garments becomes available. Should these items be determined to be operationally suitable and effective, they will be placed on the APPS SWAT authorized procurement list. Any future procurement from the APPS SWAT authorized procurement list will be made by state and local agencies under their respective local procurement regulations.<BR><BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>There are no barriers to competition. No further Federal acquisition involvement will be required as this program terminates at the conclusion of testing. Any subsequent acquisition of this equipment will be conducted at the state and local level and is subject to state and local acquisition rules and regulations.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than noon on March 1, 2010.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY - Amendment No. 3  -
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES 1.  In Section J.3 - Final Plans Phase I Drawings: Remove Drawing 2 of 41 and replace with Revised Drawing 2 of 41 Revised - Estimated Quantities Sheet and Amend the PLAN NOTES found in Drawing No. 4 of 41 and 5 of 41 to reflect the following information: Topsoil should reflect incidental to the bid item for the unclassified borrow.  There is no undercut ignore note. There is no new permanent signs ignore note.2. QUESTIONS & ANSWERS  (Provided solely For Information Only to all plan holders).
Question:  Salvage & Stockpile of Existing Asphalt Surfacing & Base Material - the plans call for removing the existing pavement & base, then stockpiling and replacing on the roadway.  There is no sub grade preparation or grading of the existing roadbed, so we would propose traditional cold in-place recycling of the existing pavement & base after the roadbed has been widened, and then reshape the salvaged base material on the widened roadway.  This would eliminate hauling the salvaged material into a stockpile and back onto the roadway.  It doesn't seem reasonable to remove all this base & pavement material from the existing roadway if there is not work to be done on the sub grade.
Answer:  Salvaged material is not to be placed upon the existing surface after removal as some may be contaminated and calls for a site by approval of COR and contractor, which will be a place the Tribe wishes to store it.  Therefore there can be no in place cold recycling.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;a.&#12288;Concrete pours in the Hato Rey area where the Project is located normally start very early in the morning (around 4:00 AM).&#12288; The reason for starting concrete pours at this time is to avoid the high temperatures of the late morning hours, and to avoid delays in the delivery of the concrete material to the project due to the heavy traffic that occurs in Hato Rey after 6:30 AM.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;i.&#12288;Will concrete pours and other related works be allowed outside Normal Working Hours?</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Answer: Yes, concrete pours and other related work will be allowed outside normal working hours.</strong></p>

<strong><strong><span>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer: "Exterior Stucco" and "Cementitious Finish" on concrete is primarily limited to areas at or near grade. Also refer to Specification Section 03 3300 paragraph 3.1.C.8 for finish requirements of Architectural Concrete. See Architectural drawings for extent and locations.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;13.&#12288;Division 26 of the Technical Specifications describes the Lightning System for the facility, but there is no design shown on the Electrical Drawings.&#12288; Please clarify.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Answer: The lightning protection system must be designed by the lightning protection Master Label contractor.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">This is the industry standard. The system is being bid based on building plans and a specifications.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;14. On page 6 of the Geotechnical Engineering Study (GES) prepared by Langan Engineering and Environmental Services for this solicitation, dated November 6, 2009, it is stated: "We request the Architect and Structural Engineer provide plans for our review and comment". Please confirm if the bid drawings and technical specifications were delivered to the Geotechnical Engineer (GE). In the event that such drawings were delivered to the GE, please confirm if the GES remains unchanged.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;<strong>ANSWER: The architectural and structural plans were provided to Langan (the GE), and Langan participated in the preparation of the earthwork specifications. The statement that the question refers to was included in the section of the report discussing drainage behind retaining walls. We have reviewed the applicable portions of the plans and have confirmed that the drainage recommendations provided in our report were implemented in the project plans.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;We also would like to call attention to the fact that the retaining wall to be constructed as part of the security improvements was also addressed as part of an additional subsurface investigation, the results of which were presented in a 22 January 2010 letter-report by Langan.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;15. Is it acceptable to substitute the engineered backfill required under footings, with a 4" lean concrete layer?</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Answer: We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the footing subgrade preparation requirements. There are two footing subgrade preparation procedures. One for the parking garage footings, and one for the anti-ram wall footing.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;The parking garage footings are to be supported by the stiffer portions of the underlying Stratum 2 clayey materials, and it is expected that this material will be present (without the need for over-excavation) on most of the site at the minimum bottom of footing elevation recommended in our report and incorporated into the structural plans. However, in the case that the stiffer portions of the Stratum 2 materials are not reached underneath a particular footing, an over-excavation until reaching the proper bearing material will be necessary.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;As recommended on the geotechnical engineering report, the over-excavated depth could be backfilled with properly placed and compacted engineered fill. Please note that the over-excavation is not expected to be thicker than 1 to 2 ft based on the conditions observed at the boring locations, and we request to be notified if deeper over-excavations are necessary. If the backfilling will be done using engineered fill, the excavation sides should be enlarged by 1 ft on all sides, relative to the footing dimensions. Alternatively, the backfilling could be done with lean concrete, but the thickness would depend on the actual depth of over-excavation vs. the proposed bottom of footing elevation. Another option would be to pour those footings with an increased thickness and bearing directly on the proper bearing material.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The over-excavation below the anti-ram footing cannot be shallower than 1 ft, followed by the recommended proofrolling at the subgrade of the over-excavation. Lean concrete could also be used to replace the engineered fill that would be necessary to backfill the over-excavation underneath the anti-ram wall footing, but would need to be 1 ft thick.</p>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Answer:</p>
</span>&nbsp;</strong><strong>"Exterior Stucco" and "Cementitious Finish" on concrete is primarily limited to areas at or near grade. Also refer to Specification Section 03 3300 paragraph 3.1.C.8 for finish requirements of Architectural Concrete. See Architectural drawings for extent and locations.</strong></strong><strong>"Exterior Stucco" and "Cementitious Finish" on concrete is primarily limited to areas at or near grade.

<DESC>Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-FrederickSynopsis for Acquisition Workforce TrainingThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has authority under the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (Pub. L. no. 109-461, 120 Stat. 3433 (2006)) and Executive Order 13360 to establish special acquisition methods to increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs).  In an effort to support this Act, the VA is pursuing a total set-aside solicitation for SDVOSBs and VOSBs for Acquisition Workforce Training.This solicitation is being synopsis accordance with FAR 5.201.  1.	Action Code:  P - Presolicitation Notice2.	Date:  February 25, 20103.	Year:  20104.	Contracting Office Zip Code:  217035.	Classification Code:  U008  Trng/Curriculum Dvlp6.	Contracting Office Address:Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-Frederick7485 New Horizon WayFrederick, MD  217037.	Subject:  Acquisition Workforce Training8.	Proposed Solicitation Number:  VA798-10-RP-00609.	Closing Response Date:  April 12, 201010.	Primary POC:  Lora GrossAlternate POC:  James Poe11.	Description:In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards.  The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.The program mirrors, as closely as possible, the requirements that the Department of Defense established for its contracting workforce under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  The program will be administered by each civilian agency, and FAI will conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the program is being managed consistently.  The certification shall be accepted by, at minimum, all civilian agencies as evidence that an employee meets the core education, training and experience requirements to be a contracting professional (generally the GS-1102 series).The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequently Office of  Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions including mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant regardless of their occupational series are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTRs).  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  For the past two years, the VA has been coordinating classes for the acquisition workforce.  Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide FAI approved or DAU certified acquisition training courses and materials for FAC-C Certification, Contracting Electives and COTR, to better establish consistency, and create a more efficient process for procurement.  A Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR 12 and 15 for Commercial and Negotiated acquisition procedures.The anticipated period of performance is for a term of five (5) years.10.  Place of Contract Performance:  Performance will be predominantly at the VA Acquisition Academy (VAAA) in Frederick, MD.  There will be no reimbursement for local travel within the Washington, DC metro area.11.  Set Aside:  This acquisition will be negotiated on a total SDVOSB/VOSB small business set-aside basis.12.  Transmittal:    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by VA.  This solicitation and any subsequent amendments will be posted to the FBO website:  https://www.fbo.gov/.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted to the FBO website on or about March 12, 2010 with proposals due by April 12, 2010.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals prior to offer due date.

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, J05RA00004.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to Adams and Associates, Inc. under contract number J05RA00004.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $262,348 to the Atterbury Job Corps Center, operated by Adams and Associates, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.  Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification.  As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.

The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:  To procure Educational Services CTT curriculum and equipment pertaining to the development of green training elements/modules as detailed in Job Corps Program Instruction No. 09-30 consisting of an electric vehicle for student training Heavy Equiment Operators Simulators, Carpentry Shop-Install Dust Collector Systems, Three Solar Parking Lot Lights, Replace Washers (38) and Dryers (56), Replace ex welding units with new energy efficient inverter-based units (18), and occupancy sensors,. and to address the following career technical skills training (CTST) project to support green training and practices applicable to all Job Corps Centers as detailed in Job Corps Information Notice No. 09-09:  Occupancy Sensors.  The operator of the Atterbury center will utilize these funds to support additional career technical skills training opportunities to the students of the Atterbury Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Atterbury Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.  

This modification has been awarded on February 25, 2010.

<DESC>This The Contractor is to provide HITREC/HITRC a comprehensive, CRM SaaS solution that is capable of capturing sustomer interaction data, support operational and reporting needs to the Region Extension Centers, and also provides seamless support for multiple interactions types and groups with the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC).  

This was a competive requirement under the GSA MAS schedule, and was awarded as a Time-and-Materials contract.  ONC could not predict with a great degree of accuracy the number of actual software licences that would be required for a 4 year contract.   It was determined to be too risky to do a fixed-price contract, when the estimated amount of licenses could end up being much lower then anticipated.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) issued against BAA-09-0003.  The nature of development work often requires a cost-reimbursement arrangement.  In addition, the contractor's accounting system has been deemed adequate for determining cost applicable to the contract and appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.
