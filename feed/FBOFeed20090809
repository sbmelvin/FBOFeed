<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to procure the following services. This RFQ is a total small business set-aside. This Task Order will be awarded to the Offeror whose proposal is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government BEST VALUE price and other factors (identified below) considered. For purpose of this evaluation: technical factors, (approach, staffing/management and experience) are most important in making the award determination. The Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior technical performance. Technical Evaluation: Technical proposals will be evaluated according to the criteria set forth: 1-Technical Approach/Plan: Contractors are to provide a discussion of their technical approach for providing the services required for this Task Order. Specifically, the Contractor must submit a statement of the scope and purpose of the project to demonstrate complete understanding of the organization and its current status in regard to strategic and operational planning. The Contractor must provide a proposed approach that ensures the achievement of timely and acceptable performance, to include a milestone and/or phasing charts to illustrate a logical sequence of proposed events. The technical approach should also clearly describe an overview of the methodology used for guiding performance of the technical requirements identified in the SOW and a general description of how the Contractors' technical approach will be applied to accomplish the requirements. Contractors are to provide (1) a staffing plan that identifies the experience of key staff working under this Task Order; and (2) a management plan that describes their approach for managing the work to include subcontracts management if applicable. This criteria will be evaluated according to the soundness, practicality, and feasibility of the contractor's technical approach for providing the services required for this Task Order; <br />2-Similar Experience: Contractors must provide information reflecting experience and knowledge of assigned staff that is similar in complexity and size to the anticipated project. This information will be represented by the proposed staff/personnel resumes. This criteria will be evaluated to determine appropriate experience of assigned personnel; 3-Business Plan (Cost): The contractor shall list all deliverables or tasks requested under the SOW and provide the unit and extended prices for each task/deliverable. Business proposals must contain the following: (1) Itemized costs, by cost element (e.g. direct labor, fringe benefits, travel, subcontracts, other direct costs, overhead, G&amp;A, fee, etc.). (2) The basis of each proposed cost element, to include labor hours; labor mix; breakdown of the amount estimated for travel (including destination, duration, purpose, per diem costs, and transportation costs); subcontract costs; other direct costs (quantity and cost); etc. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request supporting data for proposed costs in order to adequately determine the reasonableness of the proposed amounts. Offerors' price proposal will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness. Prices that are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable, and may receive no further consideration. The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, subcontracts, etc.) may be contained in the technical proposal so your understanding of the statement of work can be evaluated. The proposal must differentiate the tasks to be performed by the contractor from those tasks to be performed by subcontractors. Communications with unauthorized individuals concerning a specific RFQ prior to award may jeopardize your eligibility for award. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
