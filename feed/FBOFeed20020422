<DESC>SUBJECT?NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS
Desc: The General Services Administration intends to award a sole source contract with Harris Corporation, 1680 University Avenue, Rochester, NY 14610. This contract is to procure the RF-5800U-MP which is a member of the FalconII family of multiband tactical radio systems. This advanced software reprogrammable digital radio supports continuous operation across the 90 MHz to 420 MHz band with 20 W FM and 10 W AM transmit power with Havequick I/II capability. The RF-5800U-MP meets the need for both military and civilian ground-to-air communication in a single package, while providing interoperability with Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems. Voice communications are provided in 8.33 and 25 kHz channels to support the evolving air traffic control standards. Standard features of the RF-5800U-MP include 100 programmable radio presets, full RS-232 remote control support, multiband scan, radio-to-radio preset cloning, a swept frequency distress beacon (available on any channel), and CTCSS tone support for LMR repeaters. The radio is interoperable with Havequick I/II ECCM in voice and data modes. When coupled with the standard external GPS Precise Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) compatible interface or optional internal GPS receiver, Havequick TOD can be obtained directly.The optional exportable Harris CITADEL TMbased encryption provides high speed digital encryption for either voice or data traffic and can be customized as required. The RF-5800U-MP is interoperable with the AN/PRC-113(functional replacement), URC-200, and AN/PRC-117 radios.
These units are identical to the ones previously installed at NAS Fallon and these units will maintain the established communication equipment baseline of compatability, staff experience, configuration, setup, repair and parts replacement. Any other manufactured units would impact the operator, maintenance and the established logistics support structure and would require new engineering analysis and testing. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Description: The Navy intends to negotiate a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) on a sole-source basis with Raytheon E-Systems, Inc. of Greenville, Texas for a not-to-exceed amount of $3,000,000.  The BOA will cover a three-year period and include line items for logistics and engineering support, repairs, and/or upgrades of unique Weapons Replaceable Assemblies and Shop Repairable Assemblies relating to the EPR-165 and EPR-208 Signal Processors and EPE-113 Dual Disk Drive.  Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Raytheon E-Systems and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government’s requirements.  This synopsis will satisfy the BOA requirement to issue a synopsis for job orders on a semi-annual basis.  See Government-wide numbered notes 22 and 26. ***** Contact Mr. Brian Moellers, Tel 812-854-1812, Fax 812-854-3805 or e-mail moellers_brian@crane.navy.mil.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from prospective offerors to perform a continuation of a series of previous monitoring efforts developing a long-term database related to the environmental health of the East and West Flower Garden Banks, located approximately 115 miles off the Texas coast in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico.  This study is important for validating the decision to relax the lease-stipulated requirement on the offshore industry to monitor exploratory or development and production activities within the 1-mile zone of the banks.  Oil and gas activity in the area has continually increased in recent years.  The East and West Flower Garden Banks have received an increasing variety of protective special area designations including Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) for Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Special Ocean Site (SOS) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This effort shall continue the long-term monitoring at the East and West Flower Garden Banks to detect any subtle, chronic effects from natural and man-induced activities that could potentially endanger community integrity. The monitoring shall be consistent with past MMS topographic features monitoring, as well as the previously required lease stipulation monitoring for activities located within the 1-mile zone of the Flower Garden Banks. Techniques are similar to most all other coral reefs monitoring studies. Observations shall be made to evaluate coral colonies, accretionary growth, and general community health.  Continuously recording water quality instrumentation was added to the ongoing study in 2001.  These instruments shall be maintained and data analyzed for a variety of water quality parameters. Ongoing monitoring at the Flower Garden Banks is important to validate and to sustain our contention that the lease stipulations provide effective mitigation of impacts to the offshore environment and particularly, these sensitive and unique biological features.  Continuation of the proposed study is important to validate the decision to relax the lease-stipulated requirement on the offshore industry to monitor exploratory or development and production activities within the 1-mile zone of these topographic features.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST demonstrate they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 4:00 P.M., EST, MAY 14, 2002, a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) Key Personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience and your organizational experience and facilities in the (A) fields of coral reef ecology, marine benthic and fisheries biology, and physical and chemical oceanography;  (B) demonstration of scientific expertise in these stated disciplines through appropriate peer-reviewed publications;  and (2) Past Performance, including specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years. REFERENCES SHALL BE CHECKED.  Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and two (2) copies, and one electronic copy in MS Word on a floppy disk to, Minerals Management Service, 381Elden Street, Procurement Operations Branch, MS-2500, Herndon VA 20170-4817.

<DESC>NASA/HQ's Office of Human Resources and Education, Code FE announces a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) soliciting proposals to establish a collaboration between NASA and a host organization to further develop and implement the NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP).   The NSIP serves as a major national educational program addressing the widespread need of American students for greater scientific, mathematics, technological, engineering, and geography (SMTEG) literacy. NSIP is a program of six competitions linking students in grades K-12 directly with NASA's mission of exploration, research, and discovery.  Students prepare entries as individuals, as teams, or as a whole class, depending on the competition category and grade level.   The NSIP is an enrichment experience for both students and teachers.  It provides educators with instructional material and classroom-ready resources that support an inquiry-based approach to science, math, technology, engineering, and geography education.  In preparing their investigations for submission to NSIP, students sharpen their inquiry, problem solving, and creative writing skills.  NASA is looking for a partner with education service experience to design competitions that focus on and include students in upcoming or existing missions within the NASA Enterprises in order to keep all research timely and applicable.  More information on this year's competition, is available on the NSIP website http://www.education.nasa.gov/nsip   Each NSIP competition category has a Resource Guide that provides instructional materials, tips, and resources for using in investigations and design challenges.  These materials support national standards, state frameworks, and local school curricula.  NASA seeks a synergistic program that focuses on NASA's missions, facilities, human resources, and programs to provide information, experiences, and research opportunities for students to support the enhancement of knowledge and skills in the SMTEG fields.  NASA is seeking a partner with the infrastructure and credentials to support a national science based student involvement program for participants ranging from Kindergarten through Grade 12.  The program will reach into all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in schools of United States overseas civil and military establishments, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and outlying United States territories.  Our partner will develop, implement, enhance, and administer an innovative educational program and approach that will: (a) involve a great diversity of participation among schools, students and teachers; (b) balance gender participation and increase ethnic diversity of competition participants; and (c) provide age appropriate experiences that uses scientific inquiry and critical thinking skills to positively influence student learning.  This CAN represents an effort to develop a program that encourages all students to work toward scientific literacy through the motivating competitions on topics of aerospace. More information on the current program can be found at the following web site:  http://education.nasa.gov/nsip Only one cooperative agreement will be awarded as a result of this CAN.  Participation is open to all firms, partnerships, and consortia.  Recipients shall not be paid a profit.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item or service using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The anticipated release date of the CAN is late May 2002 with an anticipated proposal due date of late June 2002. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available on the NASA Headquarters Web site:  http://education.nasa.gov/nsip Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB), plans to procure continuous genotyping services from BioServe Biotechnologies, LTD, 1050 West Street, Laurel Maryland.  This procurement will provide for continuation of research studies previously awarded under NCI purchase order 263MQ116056.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $5M.  The Cancer Prevention Studies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the extraction of high molecular weight DNA from human lymphocyte specimens collected in the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT).  The ultimate purpose of this research project is to obtain high molecular weight DNA from lymphocytes that are suitable for subsequent analyses and to test the quality of the DNA already extracted from some samples.  This DNA will then be used in future analyses by many different NCI investigators to investigate the role of different genetic polymorphisms on adenomatous polyp recurrence and diet gene interactions.  BioServe is currently in the process of isolating DNA from lymphocytes of 830 polyp prevention trial participants.  BioServe Biotechnologies has previously been selected to provide custom high-throughput mass-spectrometry based Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight genotyping services for the PPT.  Mass-spectrometry genotyping has provided extremely accurate and reproducible results, with 100% consensus rates in all blinded control samples analyzed.   Mass-spectrometry genotyping is also able to genotype polymorphisms where restriction sites are not present.  Previously, BioServe has performed XRCC1, APE, MTHFR and GSTm1 assays for the CPSB.  BioServe is the only company that does MALDI-TOF of DNA and NCI requires the samples being tested for QC in this Purchase Order, 5000, to be compared to the data from other MALDI data that BioServe is providing. For scientific continuity NCI has a strong programmatic need to continue the work with BioServe to maintain the essential scientific comparability of the data.  BioServe is capable of genotyping 10,000 samples in 24 hours with almost 100% reproducibility rate.  In addition, they are able to do each genotype assay with as little as 1-3 nano-grams of genomic DNA (other labs are known to use as much as 20-100 nano-grams). To introduce another company would be detrimental to this research work.  BioServe Biotechnologies is the only source known to the NCI researcher to obtain high molecular weight DNA from lymphocytes that are suitable for subsequent analyses and to test the quality of the DNA already extracted from samples.  BioServe has the expertise in  MALDI-TOF techniques which yields 100% reproducibility rate.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, on May 7, 2002.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by  the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, please mail one (1) original and two (2) copies to the following address: Please mail to Malinda  Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Room 6072, Rockville, Maryland, 20852-7194.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Maj. Chris Harrington, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Technical and performance risk are significantly more important than price. The following technical evaluation criteria will be used:  FACTOR 1: MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. The offeror has successfully demonstrated compliance with all of the minimum performance requirements contained in the solicitation. This factor will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE basis.  An offeror may be rated UNACCEPTABLE AS SUBMITTED if the proposal has not demonstrated compliance with all minimum requirements but has the potential to do so if amended during discussions.  Offerors are cautioned that the Government intends to award without discussions, so proposals deemed UNACCEPTABLE AS SUBMITTED may not be considered for award. Proposals deemed UNACCEPTABLE will not be evaluated for Factor 2.  FACTOR 2:  PERFORMANCE RISK ASSESSMENT. The extent to which the offeror's proposal reflects an appropriate apportionment of performance risk will be evaluated in this factor. Performance risk considerations are defined as those characteristics of the offeror that give indication of the likelihood of the offeror's successful performance of the current requirement. Their proposed delivery schedule, record of on-time delivery for same services and product, quality of workmanship displayed in same services and product, reliability of same class services and product, business relations exhibited during previous contracts, range and depth of support provided for same class services and product.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Advanced Systems and Technology Office (SEA93 ASTO), Arlington, VA, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), are soliciting proposals for an Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) program to perform research, development, modeling, design, and testing of voice communication systems that directly measure the speech excitation waveform generated by the glottis, and that then use that data to advantage for speech communications. The program is specifically focused on employing low cost, low power microradars (embedded in, e.g., a radio handset) that directly measure the glottal excitation waveform. The program goal is to investigate the implications to military voice communications associated with direct measurement of the glottal waveform, to include noise reduction in military environments, reduction of voice communication bit rates, and speaker authentication. A specific goal for this program is to provide in the noise environments associated with military operations robust voice communication at bit rates less than about 1 kb/sec (with a program goal of 300 bps or less), while maintaining the speech intelligibility currently available in acoustically benign environments from the current DoD standard voice encoder (vocoder). The ability to provide intelligible speech in relevant environments at very low data rates is of great importance to the warfighter. Aside from the anticipated benefit of noise suppression, the ability to encode speech at very low data rates will greatly reduce the probability of detection of the communications link. Furthermore, it is expected that substantial net reductions in power consumption for voice communications will be realized, thus greatly increasing battery lifetime.

Research has shown that it is practical to measure the glottal excitation waveform for voiced speech through the use of a microradar situated close to the speaker. It should be noted that although the radar-measured waveform has been shown to closely follow the glottal waveform measured by other laboratory techniques, controversy exists regarding the precise nature of what is being measured; specifically, whether the radar is measuring the actual motion of the glottal folds, or the pressure-induced displacement of the walls of the subglottal tract. 

Since it is possible to know precisely when voicing is occurring, it should be possible to develop algorithms that strongly suppress the ambient colored and non-stationary noise environments that occur in these circumstances. Speech communications would be rendered more intelligible at lower bit rates even when, for example, standard vocoders are being used. The availability of the glottal waveform and its time history provides data that may be used to develop new, more efficient vocoders that take advantage of the timing data and the measurement of the speech excitation function. The ability to directly measure the speech signal and its excitation function implies the ability to directly calculate the vocal transfer function. It is anticipated that the availability of the glottal waveform data potentially allows the development of vocoders that provide intelligible and prosodically accurate speech at bit rates close to the limits implied by the fundamental information content in the signal. Finally, the glottal waveform data provides information that might be of significant value in authenticating the identity of the speaker. This data might provide information useful in determining the emotional and physical state of the speaker.

Research and development will be conducted in four separate areas. 1) Fundamental measurements and speaker authentication. Fundamental measurements are needed to determine unamibiguously the phenomenological basis for the microradar measurements of the glottal waveform.  Investigate the placement and orientation of the sensor relative to the speaker, and determine optimal values of other sensor characteristics, such as power, directionality, and waveform parameters. Measurements need to be conducted regarding the stability of the glottal waveform as a function of time, and as a function of speaker characteristics and speaker state (e.g. emotional state).  Related, is a study of the utility of the glottal measurements for speaker authentication, including combining information from the glottal data and speech data. This work would be informed by the understanding of glottal waveform stability and basic phenomenology developed in this research area. 2) Noise suppression algorithms. Algorithms will be developed that use information from the glottal measurements to suppress extraneous noise that interferes directly with the intelligibility of the transmitted speech, and that degrades vocoder performance. Algorithms developed will need to be robust in the presence of unvoiced speech. Noise suppression sufficient to render currently used low bit rate vocoder performance robust to the military noise environment is alone viewed as an important result of this technology. 3) Low bit rate vocoders, may include relatively low risk extensions of current vocoding techniques, as well as high risk novel vocoding techniques. It is expected that the availability of excitation timing measurements, unambiguous indication of voicing, and the detailed excitation function of the vocal tract, will enable more efficient vocoders to be developed. Furthermore, the excitation data is expected to more robustly allow extraction of prosodic information from the speech. In addition, speech uttered by a speaker who is highly stressed might be rendered more intelligible. These vocoders might be logical extensions of current approaches (e.g. GELP coders), or they might include novel vocoders that, for example, take advantage of the ability to directly calculate the vocal transfer function to parse the speech into fundamental components (e.g. phonemes). In the latter case bit rates substantially lower than 1 kb/sec, and as low as the 300 bps program goal or perhaps less are expected. Vocoders developed within this program are expected to operate robustly in noise environments typical of military operations. Reproducing the speaker waveform at the receiver with sufficient fidelity to allow the receiver to audibly confirm the identity, and state of the speaker, although desirable, this program might develop alternate authentication metrics that reduce or eliminate speaker fidelity requirements in favor of reduced bit rates. 4) Novel means for measuring or robustly estimating speech components that differ from microradar techniques. The program emphasis is on the consequences stemming from the ability to directly measure the glottal waveform with a radar during the generation of speech, however there is also an interest in exploring other potential means for robustly measuring speech. New techniques for measuring speech, that differ from the program baseline technique of utilizing a microradar, that have potential to meet the program goals, will be explored.

The approach of this program is to augment the basic speech waveform with additional non-acoustic measurements.  Proposals must adhere to this basic approach to be responsive to this solicitation.

Work under this effort will be conducted at the Unclassified security level. However, the potential for classified applications exists. Offerors should identify the ability to perform this effort at the SECRET security level. This discussion should include facility and safeguarding capability, and proposed personnel clearances.

The Government will host an unclassified ASE program and related topics briefing for interested representatives on Friday, 10 May  2002, at Westfields Marriott, 14750 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151. Written questions about the program or this BAA will be solicited on ASE Industry Day and subsequently. All Q&A will be posted to the ASE website. Organizations wishing to send representatives should register via the ASE Industry Day registration web site (preferred) http://schafercorp-ballston.com/vocoder, via e-mail, by fax or in writing.

If any portion of the research is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the requirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the research if the resource is not provided. (Note: It is the Governments intent to use the Offeror's SOW as written, provided that it accurately describes the work to be performed, is enforceable, and is void of any inconsistencies.  If it does not reflect these requirements, the Government will prepare a SOW using information available in the Offeror's proposal.) 
	H. Definition of management and key personnel.  The offering team should define both the organizations and the individuals within those organizations that make up the team, including expected duties, members and expected relationships among members.

	L.  Intellectual property and program deliverables.  The Offeror should describe proposed approach to intellectual property rights, together with supporting rationale of why this approach offers the best value to the Government.  Should include a one-page summary of the deliverables. This section should list technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation to be provided at the end of the effort with other than unlimited rights in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017 IDENTIFICATION AND ASSERTION OF USE, RELEASE, OR DISCLOSURE RESTRICTIONS (June 1995).    
	M.  The Offeror shall describe the facilities that would be used, and discuss ability to safeguard classified material and provide personnel with appropriate security clearances if necessary.

Volume II shall include the one-page WBS, a cost summary, and breakdown of costs by work area, if applicable.

Proposal evaluation and selection criteria are described below. Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area. 
	(1) Overall scientific and technical merit. The proposed solution meets the letter and intent of the stated requirement and all elements within the proposal exhibit a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The offeror clearly addresses how the proposed effort will meet and progressively demonstrate the goals of the Advanced Speech Encoding Program. The proposed solution meets multiple DARPA/NAVSEA or user needs and is conclusive with compliance and justification of required elements in the solicitation. 
	(2) Technical Performance. The proposed technical approach is feasible, achievable, complete and supported by a proposed technical team that has the expertise and experience to accomplish the proposed tasks. Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final product that achieves the requirement can be expected as a result of award. The proposal identifies all technical risks and planned mitigation efforts are clearly defined and feasible. The roles of the prime and other participants required are clearly distinguished and pre-coordination with all participants are fully documented. The requirement for and use of Government Furnished Material (GFM) including all equipment, facilities and information is fully described including dates when required. Intellectual property ownership and the planned transition to production are adequately addressed.  Similar efforts by the offeror are described, including identification of other Government sponsors.  
	(3) Management Plan, key personnel, previous accomplishments, other ongoing research, and facilities.  Focus will be on the capabilities and demonstrated achievements of the key personnel and the prime and subcontractor organizations. The offeror's past performance in similar efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to deliver products that meet the proposed technical performance requirements within the proposed budget and schedule. The proposed project team has the expertise to manage the cost and schedule. Management plans must demonstrate: superior Government visibility into and interaction with key technical activities and personnel; and, single point of responsibility for contract performance. 
	(4) Intellectual property (data rights) approaches that provide best value to the Government.
	(5) Reasonableness of proposed costs and schedules and the potential affordability impact on the Navy, 
	(6) And, the Offeror's plans and capability to transition the technology to operational Navy, Army, Air Force, or other military communications systems.
These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with "Overall scientific and technical merit" significantly more important.

At the conclusion of the evaluation, Offeror(s) will be notified, as applicable, that: 1) its proposal has been accepted for negotiation, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.  Proposals not accepted will be destroyed; however, DARPA and NAVSEA each will retain and file one copy of non-accepted proposals.  Those proposals accepted pending the availability of funds may be considered for funding for up to twelve months after the closing date of this BAA.  Not all proposals evaluated as acceptable may be funded.  

Offerors are advised that non-government employees (from MIT:Lincoln Laboratory, SLE Associates, Solers Inc., Schafer Corporation and Eastern Sierra Research, Inc. may be called upon as technical advisors in the source selection process.  These individuals will be required to sign non-disclosure statements and will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal that are necessary to enable them to perform their duties.  Such firms are expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition and from proposal scoring, ranking or recommending the selection of a source.  By submission of a proposal, the team agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to selected individuals.  Information not intended for limited release to these individuals must be clearly marked and segregated from other proposal material.

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism intents to negotiate on a sole-source basis with John Hopkins Biostatistics Center, School of Hygiene and Public Health for a project entitled, ?Training Session and Data Analysis on Multi-Level Modeling.?  The statutory authority to negotiate with John Hopkins is 41 U.S.C.  253(c)(1) under FAR reference 6.302-1.  The purpose of the proposed contract is train staff from the Division of Biometry and Epidemiology (DBE) in the estimation and interpretation of multi-level models using DBE data sets and examples of actual alcohol-related analyses.  John Hopkins processes both the expertise in complex national surveys and statistical sophistication in the required areas to carry out this effort.  They successfully developed applications of new and emerging statistical techniques, including growth curve modeling.  They are uniquely qualified to carry out these activities because of their vast experience with multi-level models (as demonstrated by course offerings and publication in this area), their familiarity with complex national data bases entailing the use of sample weights, and their experience in teaching multi-level modeling techniques to graduate students who represent a variety of public health disciplines.  Inquires must be made in writing, telephone inquires are unacceptable.  See Note Numbers 22 and 26.

This solicitation covers a wide range of products and services, as they relate to Test and Measurement Equipment and Services, Avionics Equipment and Services, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.   Product Support Options (PSOs) are services that relate to the Test and Measurement product lines and support the individual products themselves.  These services are in addition to the standard commercial offered options.  PSOs are covered by the following SINs: 627-2000 ? Equipment Maintenance and Repair; 627-2001 ? Pre-Purchase Calibration or Calibration Traceability Certificate; 627-2002 ? Post-Purchase Calibration or Calibration Certificate; 627-2003 ? Extended Warranty; 627-2004 ?

These solicitation allows for offers for new services and/or products under the Introduction to New Services/Products (INSP) SIN 627-1007; see Clause L-FSS-400.  This SIN is intended for the temporary placement of new services and products until the service/item can be formally placed on an existing or newly created SIN on this schedule.  This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implements Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAM) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions.  This solicitation is a ?standing? solicitation, which allows vendors to submit offers at anytime; therefore, there is no closing date for the receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This solicitation will be periodically refreshed to include new and updated provisions and instructions as they relate to the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Program.  The solicitation can be downloaded from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.   Resultant contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), Firm-Fixed priced, with an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA).   The new provision entitled, ?GSA Advantage!?, has now been incorporated into this solicitation.  This new provision requires all schedule contractors to submit their electronic files to GSA Advantage! by July 1, 2001, or 6 months after contract award, whichever is later.   A new term called ?Evergreen Contracting? option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  The Evergreen clause provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all MAS Federal Supply Schedules to a one 5-year basic contract period, with three separate 5-year option periods.  The Government Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional five (5) year period, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days prior to the expiration date of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favorite Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as well as any other pertinent information in order for the Government to determine that at the current prices are fair and reasonable.  All vendors and current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period extension can not be exercised if your electronic catalog has not been approved and posted on GSA Advantage!.  Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders and you are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the threshold.  See GSAM Clause 552.232-77 entitled, ?Payment By Government Commercial Purchase Card?.  This solicitation contains the clause ?Contractor?s Report of Sales? (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and the ?Industrial Funding Fee (IFF)? (552.238-76), which requires a 1% fee due every quarter, for sales under any resultant contract.  The IFF must be included in the offered prices to GSA under this solicitation.  There is a contract sales criterion for all MAS contracts.  Clause I-FSS-639 entitled, ?Contract Sales Criteria?, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Resultant contracts will be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from the date of award are not $25,000 or above.  This schedule period will be continuance, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five (5) years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.

These numbers shall be provided upon award.  The badges are to be packaged as a matched set whereby a wallet and a pin back badge with the same serial number are packaged together.  Each completed badge shall be wrapped in white tissue paper for protection, then placed in a 4 mil zip-lock polybag.  The vendor shall provide a one year warranty on all badges if a sample of badges tested are not produced to specification as indicated within the Scope of Work.  This warranty shall include refinishing of the total shipment of badges.  It shall also cover defects in the workmanship pertaining to the failure of the pin and clasp, spring clip, stoned epoxy filler, and overall finish.  DELETE "The pre-production samples should be delivered, by means other than U.S. Postal Service, by April 24, 2002."

<DESC>This modification hereby changes the Point of Contact (POC) to Mr. Noel Vivaldi, for the following requirement originally posted on April 16, 2002.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting information from missile system integrators and other interested parties on technology available for a transformational approach to providing an affordable Supersonic Cruise Missile (SSCM) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The SSCM ACTD will culminate in a technology demonstration of a supersonic cruise missile system capable of functionally disabling time sensitive Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets, hardened and deeply buried WMD targets, or both.  Time sensitive WMD targets are broadly classified as those posing imminent threat of conducting or supporting hostile attack (or re-attack) on U.S. or allied forces or civilian population centers.

Government sponsorship of the SSCM ACTD includes DTRA, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), with additional international participation.  The objective of this RFI is to identify technological concepts and performance potential for the SSCM ACTD, which may also be used as the basis for developing the SSCM ACTD performance specification.  This specification may subsequently be provided to industry as part of the anticipated SSCM ACTD solicitation.

The SSCM ACTD will operationally demonstrate an integrated system concept - including targeting, launch control, flight vehicle, payload (warhead and fuzing), and damage assessment - using mature and evolving technologies.  Technologies of particular importance for the SSCM ACTD include but are not limited to: (a) the integrated airframe and propulsion system; (b) potential payloads for time-sensitive surface targets; (c) a potential penetrator warhead; (d) low-cost smart-fuzing options; (e) autonomous guidance, navigation, and control technologies; and (f) battle damage indication / assessment to provide positive, real-time or near real time feedback using anticipated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance resources (C4ISR).

Key performance parameters for the SSCM ACTD include but are not limited to:  (a) terminal accuracy of 3 meters Circular Error Probable (CEP) or better, excluding Target Location Error (good weather, no jamming); (b) a range of at least 400 nautical miles with a goal of at least 600 nautical miles; (c) a cruising speed of at least Mach 3.5 with a goal of Mach 4.5 or better; (d) for any air-launched demonstration variant, a maximum all-up-round launch weight of less than 2000 lbs. with a goal of 1800 lbs.; (e) warhead penetration capability of at least 10 meters with a goal of 15 meters or better through 5 ksi concrete; (f) soft target kill capability and bio-defeat fill compatibility; and (g) a strike planning, preparation, and launch duration, from receipt of target coordinates for mission planning to physical weapon release/exit from the launch platform, of less than 6 minutes.

Important design considerations for the SSCM ACTD and any follow-on program include but are not limited to:  (a) potential production affordability (assuming a production run of 200 missiles per year for five contiguous years, starting in FY07), yielding a weapon that is more cost effective than currently produced systems; (b) design flexibility and/or use of a common missile body with unique launch kits and/or boosters that allows for a launch capability from surface combatants (using existing MK 41 VLS), aircraft (F/A-18E/F strike aircraft ; USN P-3; and potentially USAF bomber platforms, including B-1B internal and B-52 external carriage), and potentially sub-surface combatants (VLS); (c) survivability, including GPS jamming resistance; (d) all-weather operation; (e) fire-and-forget operation; (f) Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) approach for in-flight retargeting; (g) low life cyclecost and ease of maintenance; (h) concept of operations (CONOPS); (i) payload modularity - that is, missile compatibility with alternate warhead concepts; (j) manufacturability and P3I considerations for a potential System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase; (k) post-ACTD residual deployment compatibility with anticipated strike planning systems; and (l) ability to pass a shipboard Weapon System Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB) and aircraft safety review and to be compliant with standard range safety flight test program requirements.  The SSCM ACTD system shall be SALT II, START, and Missile Technology Control Regime (MCTR) compliant.

An addendum on the trade space of speed, range, weight, and payload versus cost is desired that encompasses operating characteristics beyond both lower and upper ends of desired performance.  Potentially reduced performance versions of interest would be desirable to meet the following needs:  (a) for surface combatants, to support enhanced Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) volumes of fire support requirements with multiple weapons/payloads in a single MK 41 VLS canister; (b) for air, to support an optimum carrier strike wing package with a missile range of at least 300 nautical miles that meets the F/A-18E/F weapons carriage requirements and permits carrier recovery of the F/A-18E/F with two weapons aboard; and (c) for sub-surface combatants, to support VLS and Torpedo Tube Launch.

Respondents to this RFI may choose to suggest missile payloads that address either the penetration mission, the time-sensitive surface attack mission, or both.  The U.S. Government is seeking transformational approaches in program management and technology integration which will be required to provide an affordable solution to this composite problem.  Respondents are free to address the problem of targets that may relocate after attack coordinates are derived for them but are stationary during missile terminal attack, and targets that may be moving during missile terminal attack, but these attack modes are not required of the ACTD system and may be addressed in terms of a P3I approach.  Respondents should be able to reasonably justify threat and target characteristics utilized.

This RFI solicits the identification of appropriate technologies and technical capabilities for the development of the ACTD program plan.  Maturity and risk level of the supporting technologies should be addressed.  Additionally, RFI respondents should provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates to complete the ACTD program, based on the following assumptions:  (1) ACTD go-ahead in January 2004, with demonstrations complete by the end of CY07; (2) any Contractor team would provide for: (a) ACTD systems engineering, systems integration, project management, (b) conduct of two system demonstration flights - at least one surface-launched (US Navy VLS system mock-up on land test range) and potentially one air-launched (US Navy aircraft) flight - with each demonstration including transition to cruise, terminal guidance and impact with required CEP, (c) fabrication of test missiles as well as ten residual operational assets and associated operational and support equipment (including mission planning components), (d) verification of actual test performance against objectives and validation of test goals and modeling and simulations, (e) other ancillary tests or modeling and simulation adequate to ensure the ACTD system meets performance requirements, (f) appropriate level of documentation deliverables, and (g) any other tests that the contractor recommends for a successful ACTD; and (3) target preparation and flight test range costs would be borne by the Government. 

RFI responses shall be limited to no more than forty (40) pages plus no more than a four (4) page addendum, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  The response should include, but is not limited to, the following:  (a) system concept(s) and associated performance (including range-altitude-Mach profiles), cost, and risk parameters; (b) recommended ACTD approach and ROM estimate with respondent's stated assumptions for the baseline 4 year ACTD (an ACTD of less than 48 months in duration is of interest to the Government; respondents may submit an additional ROM for a shorter ACTD); (c) technology maturity and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), with rationale, for the major system subcomponents, such as the propulsion system, guidance system, payload, etc.; (d) a discussion of the military utility of the proposed system concept; and (e) any other technical information respondents deem necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment.  Cost information (ACTD ROM costs, potential production unit cost, etc.) provided should include basis of estimate substantiation.  Teaming is encouraged.  It is the Government's intention to review the data and possibly schedule a briefing with some of the respondents to gain further insight.  Those respondents will be contacted individually.  Responses shall be submitted no later than 4pm EDT on 31 May 2002 to Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Supersonic Cruise Missile ACTD RFI, Attn: Noel Vivaldi, ALT (703) 325-1198), 6801 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged and should be submitted to Mr. Vivaldi at noel.vivaldi@dtra.mil.  If providing information electronically, please ensure that the information is compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office 97 software.  Additional Information:  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this RFI.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizops.gov.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.

<DESC>This advertisement had been MODIFIED to reflect a continuous open submission period for receipt of qualificiation packages for the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOAs) as noted below.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms only in the districts listed as South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Basic Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's) in each district. The estimated time  of performance will be one (1) year and have four 4 twelve months options. BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.
  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.
  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions,
  certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the 
  extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of
  each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for
  accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans
  and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only,
  to the contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties
  are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will
  be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the
  necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision
  and overhead required to perform the work within the specified
  time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting
  Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA
  holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis. However,
  the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with
  a maximum of $3,000,000. A project could be awarded at an amount
  less than $100,000.00 if all parties are in agreement. The
  Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will
  consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types. EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others.

DESIGN: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items.
  The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed
  in the NAICS Groups 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the SBA District of South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana. The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a)program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.
  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed
  cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and
  profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded
  using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.

Contracting Office Address

Department of the Air Force, Air Education and Training Command, AETC Contracting Squadron, 2021 First Street West, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4302

Description

The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Contracting Squadron is in the process of developing acquisition strategy for a performance-based service contract to support Air Force Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training ? Helicopter (SUPT-H).  This is a combined sources sought notice and request for information and therefore not to be construed as a formal solicitation.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  The Air Force is interested in determining industry?s capabilities for the contemplated services.  The Air Force reserves the right to set-aside a portion of, or this entire acquisition for small business.  The following is background information for this requirement:

SUPT-H is the USAF?s only undergraduate, initial helicopter training program for students working towards a USAF rotary-wing qualification.  The program is currently structured in two phases:  the initial Rotary Wing Qualification Course (RWQC), and the Air Force-unique training program.  Personnel entering SUPT-H training have successfully completed the primary phase of SUPT in either the T-6A, T-34 or T-37 aircraft.  At present, between 4 to 8 students enroll every 6 to 8 weeks for approximately 55 to 65 total students per year.  The current training syllabi for RWQC and Air Force Unique programs are provided for industry review as separate attachments posted to FebBizOpps.  Currently, both syllabi together require approximately 23 to 26 weeks to complete and include 145 hours of hands-on training per student (112 hours of actual helicopter flying).  The syllabus taught skills, for the RWQC portion, consist of initial helicopter flying skills (hover, transition, etc.), emergency procedures, helicopter instrument procedures, and VFR navigation.  The Air Force Unique portion consist of AF instrument procedures, AF remote operating procedures, low-level flight / navigation / approach / departure, basic formation flight, and night / NVG procedures.

The anticipated period of performance may be up to 5 basic years with 5 one-year options.  We anticipate the contract type will be a fixed-price mechanism, under NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code 611512.  Note:  Small business concerns should also refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9.6 --Contractor Team Arrangements, and FAR 19.1 -- Size Standards.  We are particularly interested in receiving the following information from industry:

An initial 3 page or less outline of a proposed top-level concept of operations and rough-order-of-magnitude cost for obtaining the following four basic services.  For standardization purposes, at the very least, please state total cost on a price per student basis, (e.g. $130K per student) 1.) Contractor provided helicopter aircraft (assume that contractor provides full maintenance support) capable of performing all training events identified in the current RWQC and Air Force Unique syllabi, 2.) Aircrew training devices sufficient to provide a best value mix of hands-on training (proposed devices must provide effective training cues that sufficiently match the aircraft behavior to positively transfer skills), 3.) Contractor instructors to teach academics and flight events for the RWQC portion of SUPT-H, 4.) Contractor shall provide training approach for Air Force Unique syllabus using qualified contractor instructors to teach academics and flight events or utilize Air Force instructors in contractor-provided aircraft and training media at existing facilities on Ft Rucker AL (Government facilities provided as-is at no cost).  

Contractor?s are encouraged to innovate by using any of the following four suggestions (or any other contractor-recommended innovation): a.) Contractor may propose to increase the fraction of hands-on training (up to 25%) provided a simulator of adequate fidelity for the training tasks required is provided by the contractor, b.) Contractor may propose training venue other than Ft Rucker AL, provided they can furnish qualified instructors to train the entire curriculum, c.) Continental US based training facility required with sufficient housing / messing / medical available locally to support the students, and d.) Consolidation of RWQC and Air Force Unique training syllabi if qualified contractor instructors or hybrid delivery (including Air Force provided instructors) is proposed and integrated by the contractor.  Please provide your company?s name, address, point of contact and their telephone number and e-mail address.

From the 3 page outlines submitted, the Air Force may elect to select approximately 5 to 6 contractors to present their concept briefings to senior AETC leadership at Randolph AFB, TX, at a time to be determined at a future date. These briefing are for market research purposes only and the government is not obligated at this time or at any future time to purchase the services or any similar service.  Contractors must clearly understand that any information regarding this RFI is provided/presented to government personnel without any monetary consideration involved.  The government is not obligated for any costs incurred by the contractor for the development, submittal, or presentation of these concept briefs.  

Contractors are encouraged to provide comments or recommendations on the following areas, these comments will not be counted towards the 3-page limit for concept of operations:  period of performance, contract type, source selection methodology, performance incentives, quality control/assurance, and small business opportunities and joint ventures.

Please submit your information and responses via electronic mail by 10 May 02 (earlier responses are encouraged) to Capt Keith Kenne, Contracting Officer, at keith.kenne@randolph.af.mil. Mr. Jerry Strubbe, Contracting Officer at jerry.strubbe@randolph.af.mil, and Mr. Myles Rellstab myles.rellstab@randloph.af.mil .  Prospective offerors must have the financial backing to defray mobilization and operation cost for approximately ninety (90) days.  Internet and e-mail capabilities are mandatory.  Central Contract Registration (CCR) is mandatory. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice and all information and materials shall be made available at no cost to the Government. In the event the Air Force elects to procure these services from the private sector it shall do so pursuant to the applicable competitive source selection procedures set forth in the FAR.  Future information on this acquisition such as Small Business Set-Aside Determination, draft Statements of Work (SOW), milestones, and other information will be posted to FebBizOpps at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  It is the responsibility of the prospective offeror to check this site regularly for any changes. For an easy read copy of this sources sought notice/request for information, please e-mail the persons listed above.

The OPI services shall serve to provide better quality service to non-English speaking customers. The primary purpose of the OPI service is to support the need and provide service to taxpayers in languages other than English. Interested small businesses must submit to the contracting officer NLT 5/02/02 a detailed capability statement that they can, with no more than 49% of the work being done by subcontractors, perform the full scope of the work required.

The intent of the government is to award up to two (2) agreements that will focus on development of a preliminary HTSS system designs during Phase I (estimated Government share is $250K per agreement), and a Phase II (estimated Government share is $5,500K)  effort to only one of the Phase I performers for the development, fabrication, system integration and test, and vehicle integration of the two (2) prototype HTSS systems into the Bradley M2.  HTSS systems, while integrated into Bradley M2 vehicles, shall be demonstrated in an operational environment during a Limited User Test (LUT).  This BAA effort’s focus is to demonstrate HTSS maturity equivalent to Transition Readiness Level (TRL) 06/07 during the LUT in FY05.   Achievement of TRL 06/07 is essential to allow HTSS to transition to the System Design and Development (SD&D) phase (FY06 -08) and enter production (FY09) in order to support of Future Combat Systems (FCS) Block 2 production. This will be a two-phased effort.  Phase I will focus on the development of a preliminary system design, culminating in formal technical Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR).  Overall system design approach presented during the PDR will be assessed to determine technica l design maturity and program risk (technical, cost and schedule) of each Phase I performer’s approach.  The PDR assessment(s) and an updated Phase II proposal(s) (technical and cost) will be utilized to down-select to a single performer for the Phase II e ffort.  Phase II includes the development, fabrication, system integration and test, and vehicle integration efforts (Bradley M2). The Government reserves the right not to award Phase II. HTSS Acquisition Strategy:  The HTSS is an approved US Army Science and Technology Objective (STO) program for the development and demonstration of helmet tracked sensor system that increases vehicle commander’s situational awareness from the HTSS sensors and from the tactical internet.  This BAA will be a two-phased effort.  Phase I will focus on the development of a preliminary system design, culminating in formal technical Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR).  Overall system design approach presented during  the PDR will be assessed to determine technical design maturity and program risk (technical, cost and schedule) of each Phase I performer’s approach.  The PDR assessment(s) and an updated Phase II proposal(s) (technical and cost) will be utilized to down- select to a single performer for the Phase II effort.  Phase II includes the development, fabrication, system integration and test, and vehicle integration efforts (Bradley M2).  The Government intends to award up to two (2) agreements for the development of preliminary HTSS system designs during Phase I.  Only one of the Phase I performers will be selected for Phase II.  The key objective of HTSS during this BAA effort is to demonstrate HTSS hardware maturity, while integrated into Bradley M2 vehicles, in an operational environment during a Limited User Test (LUT).  LUT results will demonstrate HTSS maturity equivalent to Transition Readiness Level (TRL) 06/07 during the LUT in FY05.   Achievement of TRL 06/07 is essential to allow HTSS to transition to a S ystem Design and Development (SD&D) phase (FY06-08).  The Government will conduct an open solicitation for the SD&D phase and follow-on Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase (FY09).  The SD&D phase will emphasize optimization of the HTSS technical perfo rmance, man-machine interface, tactical internet interface, and FCS vehicle(s) integration and interface.  After successful completion of user test and experimentation, the HTSS LRIP phase will begin with an expected minimum quantity of 350 units, with opt ions for 350 additional units.  HTSS LRIP deliveries will support Future Combat Systems (FCS) Block 2 production and fielding. System Description:  The HTSS systems will provide vehicle commanders with a day/night 360o (Azimuth) x 110o (-20 o to +90 o) (Elevation) dome of situational awareness (SA) coverage, enabling optical connectivity with the dismounted infantry in closed hatc h operations, critical for Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT). HTSS is slaved to the movement of the commander’s head; employs the Low Power Uncooled InfraRed (LPUIR) FLIR (provided as GFE or offeror may propose use of alternate uncooled FLIR that possesses the same characteristics of a LPUIR FLIR) that is image fused with Image Intensified (I2) imagery for optimum performance and to see battlefield pointers; has a coded high power laser pointer to direct fire for other vehicles or dismounted s oldiers; uses an eye-safe laser rangefinder (ELRF) to facilitate precise target location; and has an on-board intrusion detection system to provide the crew SA in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle to protect from a dismounted attack. HTSS will be integ rated into the SA Tactical Internet network, assisting the commander in quickly locating enem y targets, enabling coordinated fires with other force assets, and providing enhanced close combat operations.  HTSS performance specification is shown at Attachment 1. Scope of Effort:  The HTSS BAA is for the design, development, fabrication, system integration and test, and vehicle integration (Bradley M2) of two (2) HTSS systems to meet the performance and design objectives of the HTSS specification (Attachment 1).  I t is the intent of the Government to establish an Integrated Product Team (IPT) during both phases of this effort.  The IPT will be composed of Government and contractor personnel who will work together to coordinate Government and contractor activities to  include overall program management, program scheduling, resource management, cost scheduling and status, earned value status, system engineering, performance metrics, engineering logs and notebooks, risk management, reviews, human factors and man-machine interface, logistical support considerations, user evaluation efforts, system integration and test, acceptance and qualification tests, failed item analysis, Average Unit Manufacturing Price (AUMP) allocation and tracking, field test and demonstrations, fi eld support, reporting deliverables and final report. Schedule:  Offerors will submit written proposals no later than 1500 on 17 May 2002.  Initial Government review is scheduled for 17-24 May 2002.  Errors, Omissions and Clarifications (EOCs) will be issued to offerors via email by 1500 on 24 May 2002. Respo nses to EOCs will be due on by 1500 on 29 May 2002.  Award(s) are expected before the end of June 2002.   HTSS Phase I effort(s) will culminate in a formal technical Preliminary Design Review (PDR) four (4) months after contract award.  The down selected Phase II performer shall conduct a formal technical Critical Design Review (CDR) no later than eight (8) mo nths after contract award.  Hardware delivery, after successful completion of system integration and test, and acceptance/ qualification test, is required no later than thirty-six (36) months after contract award. System integration into/onto Bradley M2 ve hicles is scheduled for month thirty-seven (37). Demonstration of HTSS hardware in an operational environment LUT, while mounted into the Bradley M2, is envisioned to take place between thirty-eight (38) and forty-two (42) months after contract award.

<SUBJECT>A -- Remote Casualty Location and Assessment Device (RCLAD)
<DESC>Remote Casualty Location and Assessment Device (RCLAD).  

We have identified a requirement to aid the rescue/fire fighting community in finding casualties under rubble and through walls to confirm their status by determining heart and breathing rates.  The rescue/fire fighting community does not currently have a device that will do this.  We envision a technology such as low power radar to identify vital signs of casualties through concrete, glass, wood, etc.  Our intent is to provide a device that will ?see through? rubble and wall material to determine the medical status of casualties.  The device should display the heart and breathing rates of the person identified.  The device should be less than 10 lbs, portable, and preferably hand held.  


(1) Does your company or organization currently produce a commercial product that serves or may serve (with modification) the purpose stated above?  Describe the underlying technology of the device.

(2) If your company does not sell a commercial product, does your company have or license a technology that can be developed into a device that will serve the purpose stated above?  Submit an estimated schedule that describes how long your company would take to develop and deliver 500 units.

(3) Does your company have experience in manufacturing medical devices?

(4) Other comments regarding the government?s course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged and appreciated.


This RFI is for information and planning purposes.  This is not a notice of solicitation.  This is not a request for proposal, and in no way commits the Government to an award of contract.  Reimbursement of any cost regarding the preparation of proposals, presentations, or bids will not be made.

<SUBJECT>A -- Adaptive Joint C4ISR Node (AJCN)
<DESC>DARPA and the Army are seeking information on capabilities to develop, integrate and demonstrate an Adaptive Joint C4ISR Node (AJCN).  The AJCN is a multi-function C4ISR payload that will be based on a modular, scaleable architecture.  AJCN functionality will include communications, signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic warfare/information operations.  Although the focus of the contemplated effort and the primary application is on airborne platforms (both manned and unmanned), the node will also have applications on ground and sea platforms.  The payload will enable users of dissimilar radios to communicate via software programmable waveforms and re-configurable hardware and processing components.  The payload will incorporate Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) software waveforms.  The payload must provide both voice and data interoperability between different waveforms.  The payload will also simultaneously perform other RF missions including SIGINT and electronic warfare/information operations.  At a minimum, the payload is expected to provide/ support the following functionality:  Separate & Simultaneous Communications, SIGINT and Electronic Attack - to include Detection, DF, identification automatic signal recognition, and copy of at least 3 narrowband and 2 wideband signals while processing at least 5 communications (or electronic attack) channels  Communication:  SINCGARS, Havequick, EPLRS, JTRS wideband networking waveform, surrogate UHF SATCOM, Link 16, PCS (or PCS-like), FCS-C low band waveform, Intelligence Broadcasts (e.g., TIBS), and Crosslink(s). TCDL/MP-CDL functionality shall be included but it can be federated.  Information Operations  Message Translation (e.g. Link 16 - VMF)  Instantaneous Receive Bandwidth:  Aggregate of 480 MHz (minimum)  Transmit Signals:  8 minimum  Tuning Range:  Receive- 2 MHz to 3 GHz;  Transmit- 20 MHz to 3 GHz  Wideband Communications at 10-45 Mbps  Robust Operation in the presence of jamming (minimum of 3 nulls of >20 dB)  Interference cancellation (active) and mitigation techniques for both cosite and offboard co-channel signals  Payload Control:  Payload control executed via an RF link from the ground  Dynamic Resource Configuration - In-flight reconfiguration of Mission Allocation (Communications/ SIGINT/Electronic Attack) and Functionality within Mission Allocation  Multi-Mission Security Architecture  Size:  Maximum of 500 lbs and 5 kW  Interested parties are requested to provide a white paper (maximum of 20 pages) that describes their capabilities to build, integrate, and demonstrate an AJCN.  The paper should briefly describe the projected payload functionality and size, weight, and power.  In addition, the paper should describe related work that shows credibility for developing and demonstrating by mid-FY05 a programmable multi-mission payload.    White papers should be submitted by 6 May 2002 to the following address:  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  ATTN: ATO  3701 North Fairfax Drive  Arlington, VA 22203-1714  The effort under consideration is a follow-on to DARPA's ongoing Adaptive C4ISR Node (ACN - formerly Airborne Communications Node) research and development program and will develop, integrate, and demonstrate airborne payloads on manned platforms such as an RC-12 and a KC-135.  This effort will start in the first quarter of FY03 and the flight demonstration will occur in the second quarter of FY05.  DARPA will evaluate the responses to this Request for Information to determine if there is sufficient industry capability to warrant full and open competition.
