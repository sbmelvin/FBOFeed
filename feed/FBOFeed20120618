<DESC>The Government is contemplating the award of a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to perform all work necessary to fill and decommission seven (7) nineteenth-century, hand-dug, domestic wells at various locations on the McGuire AFB and Fort Dix annexes of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ. The wells were originally excavated by previous owners of homesteads located on what is now property of the Joint Base. Due to potential safety issues, these open holes (wells) must be properly filled and decommissioned by a licensed and bonded well driller in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:9 D-3. <br /><br />The above general description of work does not in any way limit the responsibility of the Contractor to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to fill and decommission these wells. The period of performance for this project is 30 days after receipt of award. The magnitude of this construction is below $25,000. This solicitation will be issued as a total small business set-aside. Award of a FFP contract from this solicitation will be made on the basis of Best Value to the Government using price and past performance as evaluation factors with past performance being more important than price. The Government reserves the right to award a contract other than the lowest price offeror. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this project procurement is 237110 with a size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />A site visit will be held at a later date. The date will be provided once the solicitation is posted. <br /><br />All relevant solicitation documents including specifications and drawings will be made available for download exclusively from the internet by accessing the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov. Paper copies WILL NOT be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents; and verifying the number of amendments issued prior to the due date for proposals. All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number, register in the Central Contractor Register (CCR), and register in the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) websites in order to transact business with the Department of Defense (DOD). Failure to obtain a DUNS number and register in both CCR and ORCA may result in the delay of award of a contract or possible award to the next otherwise successful offeror who already meets these criteria at the time of award. A solicitation will be issued on or about 25 June 2012. The closing date and time of submission of offers will be contained within the solicitation package. No response to this notice is necessary and no Source List will be maintained. <br /><br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay any bid/proposal preparation costs.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is posted for notification of the final solicitation. The 15 days synopsis was posted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.204 under Solicitation Number W91QUZ-12-R-0015 (link below)<br><br>https://www.fbo.gov/notices/e28814ebd84fdbda23a2a73b58868a6d <br><br>The Army Contracting Command - National Capital Region (ACC-NCR) at Hoffman II, on behalf of the U.S. ARMY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY(USAITA) intends to procure Defense Messaging System services. The intent of the USAITA is to be a customer-focused service provider that provides, manages, operates, and maintains Information Technology shared services for the Pentagon Area and select agencies and organizations in the National Capital Region (NCR). The Department of Defense Directive stated that USAITA was to be the central source for IT services, and therefore eliminate the requirement for each Department of Defense component to establish, operate and maintain duplicative technology. The policy also explicitly directed USAITA to manage costs, as the directive outlined the responsibility to operate as a business, and continually evaluate new commercial alternatives to providing existing capabilities in the interest of finding cost savings.<br><br>USAITA is a field-operating agency under the operational control of the Army's Office of the Administrative Assistant. USAITA is an Information Technology (IT) service provider, and provides a range of shared services to the National Defense community. USAITA's customer base consists primarily of Department of Defense services and agencies inside of the National Capital Region (NCR).<br><br>The United States Army Information Technology Agency (ITA) Operations (OPS) directorate pro-vides single integrated Organizational Messaging service for Army installations, Office Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the military services headquarters staffs, the White House, Combatant Commanders, Civil Departments and Agencies, Allies, and Foreign Embassies, in accordance with Congressional, OSD and Army direction. Congress assigned this mission to the Department of Defense (DOD). The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) assigned the Army as the Executive Agent. ITA Operations provides these services on three separate security enclaves: Top Secret Collateral, Secret, and Unclassified. The scope of ITA/OPS organizational messaging service includes time critical Nuclear Command and Control; Defense Messaging using the Defense Message System (DMS); National Gateway between world-wide DoD organizations using DMS and Civil Agencies, Allies and Foreign Embassies using other messaging systems; and Pentagon Enterprise E-Mail infrastructure and directories. ITA/OPS operates messaging and directory systems in the Pentagon Telecommunications Center and a Secondary Site in order to provide a survivable Defense Messaging capability, and in order to rapidly reconstitute services to customers during times of peace, crisis, hostilities, or war.<br><br>ITA is currently undergoing an organizational transformation. This transformation is motivated by a need and desire to continually improve, adapting to changing technologies and best practices to become even more effective in delivering services to our customers. Technology is rapidly converging and the future will blur the lines between traditional IT services, requiring collaboration among diverse groups of ITA personnel to continue delivering cutting-edge services to our customers. The transformed ITA will present a single consistent face to our customers with all the service centers working together as one Enterprise.<br><br><br><br><br>

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number E12PS00034 for Proposed Research on Safety of Renewable Energy Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) hereby solicits White Papers for a specific area of interest to the BSEE Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Safety of Renewable Energy Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of TA&R research recently performed, visit http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Renewable-Energy-Research-(REnR).aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers. Note:  There is no limit on the number of white papers an organization may submit. 
BACKGROUND: 
The BSEE TA&R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement.  Selected white papers will subsequently be requested to submit full research proposals.  The proposal selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding from FY 2012.  BSEE anticipates that a single award in an amount not to exceed $140,000 may be available for the initiation of new research addressing topics identified through this announcement.  
NOTICE:  BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential offerors shall notify BSEE if they do not want their White Papers shared outside of BSEE.  BSEE anticipates the award resulting from this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis with a period of performance of approximately 12 months. 
OBJECTIVES:  The topic for the FY 2012 renewable energy research funding should be limited to the following: 
Develop a checklist of items that need to be addressed in the design basis document for offshore wind turbines. The 30 CFR 285.626 regulation is not prescriptive regarding the design standards that must be used for designing the structures for an offshore wind energy installation. Developers are allowed to use a design basis approach whereby they propose which criteria and standards to apply, and justify why each particular criteria and standard is appropriate. The developed checklist would identify all the specific topics that need to be addressed in the design basis, identifying which standards are applicable for each topic, and then making a determination on whether each standard is sufficient for this purpose. 
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Frank Bennett, not later than 2:00 PM, EASTERN TIME on July 3, 2012.  WHITE PAPERS SENT VIA EMAIL AND FAX WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merit.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS/COST PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  Projects shall be selected depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  BSEE shall evaluate the responses, and those organizations whose white papers are deemed to have merit will be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal.  This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers only and does not obligate the Government to make award.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. 
WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the Offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the Offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the renewable energy industry or other groups in the research industry, where appropriate; and (5) past performance.  IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NOT MET, THE WHITE PAPER WILL NOT BE EVALUATED. 
QUESTIONS shall be emailed to the Point of Contact below not later than 2:00 p.m., EASTERN TIME on June 25, 2012.  The Solicitation number E12PS00034 MUST be in the subject line of the email.  All questions shall include the Solicitation number E12PS00034, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to extend the period of performance of the current DFRC Research Facilities and Engineering Support Services (RF&ESS) Contract, NAS4-00047, with Arcata and Associates.  The extension will be for six (6) months, August 1, 2012 through January 31, 2013, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and NASA Procurement Information Circular (PIC) 00-22. A contract modification reflecting this extension will be issued on or before July 31, 2012, which is the expiration date of the current RF&ESS contract.  Contract NAS4-00047, a cost plus award fee contract, was awarded July 3, 2002, as a result of full and open competition to Arcata and Associates.  This extension is necessary to bridge the performance period between the end of the current contract and award of a new NASA Dryden RF&ESS contract. Services received under this contract are critical to mission operations of the NASA-DFRC.  The services provided include services and/or support for the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), Research Aircraft Integration Facility (RAIF), Information Technology (IT) Information Support Services (ISS) and Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL). WATR sustaining and developmental engineering and operations services, including telemetry/radar acquisition and processing (TRAPS) hardware and software, range display systems, real-time hardware and software processing, tracking and mobile systems, and communications and video control center RAIF sustaining and developmental engineering and operations, including simulation hardware design and integration, systems engineering and facility integration, and simulation project support to Remotely Augmented Vehicles (RAV) and Remotely Piloted Research Vehicles (RPRV) ISS, including Chief Information Office (CIO) and IT security support, central computer systems services, database analysis, programming support and web development, phone operations, cable plant services and help desk and scheduling services. IT management and operations includes systems engineering and protective services information systems. Multimedia systems support, includes audio and video technical support, imaging services, administrative and in-flight photography and video, and graphics and illustration services. FLL and range safety systems, including flight termination system development and range safety analysis. The current contractor, Arcata and Associates, is considered the only contractor that can meet DFRCs needs given the potentially short period of performance for the extension.	 The contractor has the experienced and skilled personnel already in place to provide continued and uninterrupted RF&ESS services at DFRC.  Award to another source for the period of this extension would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition of the extension and would not allow for a sufficient phase-in period.  Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform he effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 P.M. PDT on July 5, 2012. Such determination of capabilities/qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is Mr. Patrick C. Stoliker, 661-276-2076 or patrick.c.stoliker@nasa.gov. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 1500 employees, respectively.

<DESC>Performance-Based Seismic Design (PBSD)<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />All information needed for interested parties to submit is a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer qualifications, is contained herein. There is no separate Request for Proposal (RFP) package to download.<br /><br />This is a request a submission of a Standard Form 330 in accordance with the FAR Subpart 36.6. This announcement constitutes a notice of intent to contract Architect and Engineer Services. Submission to this notice of intent is not considered a proposal. <br /><br />Solicitation Number: HSFE60-12-R-0037<br />Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Services. <br />NAICS Code: 541330
<p>1. Background information<br />Performance-Based Seismic Design (PBSD) is a concept that permits the design and construction of buildings with a realistic and reliable understanding of the risk of life, occupancy and economic loss that may occur as a result of future earthquakes or other significant loading events. PBSD is based on an evaluation of a building's design to determine the probability of experiencing different types of losses, considering the range of potential earthquake events that may affect the facility. The desired performance level for a structure, along with a specified level of seismic shaking, are defined at the initiation of the structure's design process. The decision-maker then selects one or more of these performance levels, and an input ground motion event or hazard level for which this performance is to be achieved. The designer would then utilize a PBSD assessment procedure that is intended to allow for the determination as to whether these various performance levels are met or exceeded for the selected design hazard. Following the PBSD process, the building design would then be adjusted until the performance assessments indicate a risk of loss that is deemed acceptable by the building owner or regulator.<br /><br />The PBSD process may be used by the owner or their design team to:<br />&bull; Design individual critical facilities that are more loss-resistant than typical buildings designed using prescriptive criteria;<br />&bull; Design individual critical facilities with a higher confidence that they will actually be able to perform as intended after, or even during, a design event;<br />&bull; Design individual facilities that are capable of meeting the performance intent of the prescriptive criteria, but at lower construction cost than would be possible using the prescriptive criteria;<br />&bull; Investigate the performance of typical structures designed using the prescriptive provisions of the building code and develop judgments as to the adequacy of this performance; or<br />&bull; Formulate possible improvements to the prescriptive provisions contained in the building code so that more consistent and reliable performance is attained by buildings using these provisions</p>
<p>FEMA contracted with the Applied Technology Council (ATC) to initiate the Phase 1: Development of a Seismic Performance Assessment Methodology. Phase 1, which will be completed in Fiscal Year 2012, will result in the publication of Guidelines for Performance Assessment (FEMA P-58-1). These Performance Assessment Guidelines could be used directly to evaluate the performance of new and existing structures, by applying standard methods of structural analysis, coupled with structural reliability/loss estimation methods.</p>
<p>The project plan of action was originally developed by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) and published by FEMA in April 2000 as Action Plan for Performance-Based Seismic Design (FEMA-349). The FEMA-349 plan extended over an implementation period of ten years and required funding in amounts ranging from $20 to $27 million (1998 dollars). The FEMA-349 Action Plan for Performance-Based Seismic Design defined six products essential to the creation and implementation of comprehensive, acceptable Performance-Based Seismic Design Guidelines:<br /><br />Phase 1:<br />i. A Program Management Plan that incorporates a broadly based oversight group (the Steering Committee) to shepherd and promote the development of the Guidelines (over an extended period of time, say up to 10 years), and an education and implementation strategy to facilitate the use of the Guidelines. <br />ii. Structural Performance Products that quantify performance levels, specify how to evaluate a building's performance capability for a specified level of seismic hazard and with a defined reliability or level of confidence, and provide guidance on how to design a structure to meet a given performance level for a specified level of seismic hazard (with defined reliability).<br />iii. Nonstructural Performance Products that provide engineers with the capability to evaluate and design nonstructural components, such as partitions, piping, HVAC equipment (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), with the goal of ensuring that such components will meet a specified level of performance for a specified level of seismic hazard (with defined reliability). <br />iv. Risk Management Products that provide methodologies for calculating the benefits of designing to various performance objectives and to make rational economic choices about the levels of performance desired, the levels of confidence desired, and the comparative costs to reach those levels.<br /><br />Phase 2:<br />v. Performance-Based Seismic Design Guidelines that provide methodology and criteria for design professionals, material suppliers, and equipment manufacturers to implement performance-based design.<br />vi. A Stakeholders Guide that explains performance-based seismic design to non-technical audiences, including building owners, managers, and lending institutions. <br /><br /><br />2. Scope of Work<br />Please refer to the DRAFT Statement of Work attached to this notice.</p>
<p><br />3. Location<br />The primary place of performance will either be the Contractor's facilities or at another location involving the least cost to the specific Task Order. It is anticipated that most of the work will be performed on the west coast, where most of the country's earthquake expertise resides, with very few visits to FEMA required.</p>
<p>4. Contract Information<br />FEMA will utilize the procedures in FAR Subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services, to conduct this acquisition. <br />The resulting contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), with five (5) ordering periods covering a total of 60 months from the date of award. (A twelve (12) month Base Period and 4 twelve (12) month option periods.) <br />Firms will be evaluated and ranked by the A&amp;E Evaluation Board. A maximum of five (5) most qualified firms will be invited to interview with the Evaluation board, and will again be rated. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED IN THIS NOTICE.</p>
<p>5. SF330 form information:<br />Part I - Contract-Specific Qualifications: A prime or joint venture SF 330 Part I submittal must not exceed forty (40) pages, 8 1/2" x 11" front side only. Charts and drawings will be counted as two pages if submitted on 11 x 17" size paper. Double-sided pages shall be counted as two pages. The 40 page limit does not apply to Part II of the SF 330. Front and back cover pages and tab pages will not be counted in the page limit nor will these pages be evaluated; i.e., any information listed on these pages will be ignored. All pages following the first forty (40) pages will not be considered. All other material such as brochures or samples of work, attachments or extra pages will not be considered.</p>
<p>Part II - General qualifications: Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract. There is no page limit on Part II.</p>
<p>All submittals, to include portions from subcontractors, shall use a type pitch that is no smaller than a standard eleven-point font type, with the exception of charts, graphs, or tables, which shall use a pitch no smaller than 10-point.</p>
<p>Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture agreement with the chief executive of each entity identified. Copies of agreements between firms participating in a prime/subcontractor relationship must also be included in the submittal. The joint venture and the prime/subcontractor documents will not be subject to a page limitation. Any firm with a joint venture or subcontractor relationship must list the percentage and type of work that will be performed by each participating firm.</p>
<p>The Source Evaluation Board (SEB) will assess, analyze, evaluate, and rate Offerors' submissions in accordance the evaluation criteria presented in this notice.</p>
<p>6. Evaluation Criteria Factors <br />Because the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is Congressionally authorized and mandated to be a national program, the development of performance-based seismic design guidance must be done in a manner that will be acceptable to and utilized by the nation's engineering and design communities as well as the nation's model building code and standards organizations. This will require contracting with a nationally recognized engineering development organization that is intimately familiar with seismic research, design and construction, training and outreach, is able to bring together the nation's leading experts in all of the related fields, has demonstrated extensive experience working with both nation's engineering and design professionals as well as representatives from the user communities, and demonstrated extensive experience working with the development of design and construction standards and codes throughout the country.</p>
<p>The following criteria are necessary for a contractor to successfully deliver "Development of Performance Based Seismic Design Guidelines - Phase 2." Evaluation criteria will conform to FAR Subpart 36.602-1(a) which identifies 6 factors indicated below as 6.1 through 6.6. <br /><br /><br />6.1 Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.<br />List and describe the professional qualifications and specialized experiences in providing services similar to any and all of those described in this announcement for the proposed team members (including all subcontractors and subconsultants). This evaluation factor will be assessed from the SF 330 submission identifying key personnel.</p>
<p>6.2 Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required<br />The offeror shall submit a minimum of two and a maximum of six example projects within the past five (5) years to demonstrate specialized experience. The following six (6) criteria will be used:<br />Criteria #1: Demonstrated experience in the investigation of seismic technical issues as identified either as a result of the enforcement of seismic building codes or in the investigation of post-earthquake building performance.<br />Criteria #2: Demonstrated experience in working with academic researchers and research programs in general and the NSF Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) in particular in identifying and utilizing research results to address advanced seismic and seismic-related technical issues.<br />Criteria #3: Demonstrated experience in the development of government, industry or NGO seismic and seismic-related multi-hazard technical design and construction resource guidance documents and related training products. <br />Criteria #4: Demonstrated experience in working with earthquake-related issues such as tsunami and earthquake induced ground failures, including landslide, liquefaction and slumping. This would also include earthquake-induced building failures such as progressive collapse.<br />Criteria #5: Demonstrated experience in the development of training materials and related marketing/ outreach programs that promote the use seismic and multi-hazard technical design and construction guidance products and in conducting such training and outreach programs. <br />Criteria #6: Demonstrated ability to enlist and subcontract with nationally recognized experts in the following fields: structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, earth science, geotechnical, construction management, code development and enforcement, public policy, training, and academic research.</p>
<p>6.3 Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time<br />This evaluation factor will be assessed from the SF 330 submission identifying "Example projects which best illustrate proposed team's qualifications for this contract". The Offeror shall submit a minimum of two and a maximum of four example projects within the past five (5) years. These example projects should be similar to the requirement under this announcement in terms of size (i.e. dollar value), and contract length. <br />Since the contractor will be managing multiple tasks simultaneously, the example projects will also demonstrate the contractor's in-house experience in developing and managing multiple complex technical seismic design and construction guidance projects. This requires a demonstrated in-house earthquake engineering capability to ensure satisfactory product quality control.</p>
<p>6.4 Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a minimum of three and a maximum of five references. The attached Past Performance template provides for identification of client's point of contact and should be used to the extent practicable. <br />The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews or to request a written response with points of contact identified in the Past Performance template. In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the respondent.<br />If the past performance references were insufficient to demonstrate meaningful past performance (i.e. less than 3 past performance records, or past performance submissions are not relevant in terms of size, scope and complexity) a neutral rating will be given. A neutral rating will not be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror. If a Neutral rating is made, Past Performance will not be used in the overall rating. <br /><br /><br />6.5 Location in the general geographical area of the project</p>
<p>Location is not considered under the evaluation as the application of the work is nationwide. Therefore, location factor will not be used for the evaluation of this requirement.</p>
<p>6.6 Acceptability under other appropriate evaluation criteria</p>
<p>Program Management Plan (PMP): The PMP should be brief and include an explanation of the firm's management approach, management of subcontractors/consultants (if applicable), specific quality control plan used, and an organizational chart showing the inter-relationships of management and various team components (including subcontractors/consultants).

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT IS A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.<br />This is a request a submission of a Standard Form 330 in accordance with the FAR Subpart 36.6. This announcement constitutes a notice of intent to contract Architect and Engineer Services. Submission to this notice of intent is not considered a proposal. <br />Synopsis/Solicitation Number: HSFE60-12-R-0036.<br />Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Services. <br />NAICS Code 541330<br />1. Background information<br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has the goal of reducing the ever-increasing cost that disasters inflict on our country. Preventing losses before they happen by designing and building a community's structures to withstand anticipated forces from these hazards is one of the key components of mitigation. Mitigation is the only truly effective way of reducing the cost of these disasters and advance the whole of community concept.
<p>As part of its responsibilities mandated under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), and in accordance with the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (PL 94-125) as amended, FEMA is charged with supporting mitigation activities necessary to improve technical quality in the field of earthquake engineering. The primary method of addressing this charge has been supporting the investigation of seismic and seismic-related multi-hazard technical issues as they are identified by FEMA, the development and publication of technical design and construction guidance products, the dissemination of these products, and support of training and related outreach efforts based on these products. These voluntary resource guidance products present criteria for the design, construction, upgrade, and function of buildings subject to earthquake ground motions in order to minimize the hazard to life for all buildings, increase the expected performance of higher occupancy structures, and improve the capability of essential facilities to function during and after earthquakes anywhere in the United States. They ultimately serve as the basis for future changes to the nation's building codes and improve the nation's resiliency in reducing future earthquake losses.</p>
<p>FEMA has had considerable success in attracting some of the best earthquake engineers and scientists to assist in the development of these FEMA resource products. Because of this, our products have been widely used by practicing design professionals and building officials, and the techniques and technologies contained in these products are being incorporated into the nation's model building codes and consensus and industry standards. The fact that the International Building Code (IBC), the NFPA-5000 Building Code, and the nationally recognized American Society of Civil Engineers ASCE-7 minimum design loading standard have all revised their seismic requirements to incorporate material from our resource products is one of the premier successes of the NEHRP and FEMA.<br /><br />2. Scope of Work<br />Please refer to the DRAFT Statement of Work attached to this notice.</p>
<p><br />3. Location<br />The primary place of performance will either be the Contractor's facilities or at another location involving the least cost to the specific Task Order. It is anticipated that most of the work will be performed on the West Coast, where most of the country's earthquake expertise resides, with very few visits to FEMA required.<br />4. Contract Information<br />FEMA will utilize the procedures in FAR Subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services, to conduct this acquisition. <br />This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), with a term of 60 months. The minimum value of this contract will be $50,000. Individual task orders will be issued to fulfill Agency requirements.<br />Firms will be evaluated, rated and ranked, by the A-E Evaluation Board. A maximum of five (5) most qualified firms will be invited to partake in discussions with the Evaluation Board and will again be rated. A most preferred firm will be selected.<br />The most preferred firm shall be invited to submit a Technical and a Business Proposal in response to a Request for Proposal.<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED WITH THIS NOTICE.</p>
<p>5. SF330 form information:<br />Part I - Contract-Specific Qualifications: A prime or joint venture SF 330 Part I submittal must not exceed forty (40) pages, 8 1/2" x 11" front side only. Charts and drawings will be counted as two pages if submitted on 11 x 17" size paper. Double-sided pages shall be counted as two pages. The 40 page limit does not apply to Part II of the SF 330. Front and back cover pages and tab pages will not be counted in the page limit nor will these pages be evaluated; i.e., any information listed on these pages will be ignored. All pages following the first forty (40) pages will not be considered. All other material such as brochures or samples of work, attachments or extra pages will not be considered. <br />Part II - General qualifications: Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract. There is no page limit on Part II.<br />All submittals, to include portions from subcontractors, shall use a type pitch that is no smaller than a standard eleven-point font type, with the exception of charts, graphs, or tables, which shall use a pitch no smaller than 10-point. <br />Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture agreement with the chief executive of each entity identified. Copies of agreements between firms participating in a prime/subcontractor relationship must also be included in the submittal. The joint venture and the prime/subcontractor documents will not be subject to a page limitation. Any firm with a joint venture or subcontractor relationship must list the percentage and type of work that will be performed by each participating firm. <br />The Source Evaluation Board (SEB) will assess, analyze, evaluate, and rate Offerors' submissions in accordance with the evaluation criteria presented in this notification.</p>
<p>6. Evaluation Criteria Factors <br />Specialized experience is critical in performing "Seismic Technical Guidelines and Development Support (STGDS)" task orders. Congressionally mandated National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), a national program, requires the STGDS program be accepted and utilized by the nation's engineering and design communities as well as the nation's model building code and standards organizations. This will require contracting with an engineering development organization experienced with seismic research; design and construction, training and outreach; able to bring together the nation's leading experts in all of the related fields; have demonstrated extensive experience working with both nation's engineering and design professionals as well as representatives from the user communities; and demonstrated extensive experience working with the development of design and construction standards and codes throughout the country. <br />Evaluation criteria will conform to FAR Subpart 36.602-1(a) which identifies 6 factors indicated below as 6.1 through 6.6. <br />6.1 Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services<br />List and describe the professional qualifications and specialized experiences in providing services similar to any and all of those described in this announcement for the proposed team members (including all subcontractors and subconsultants). This evaluation factor will be assessed from the SF 330 submission identifying key personnel.</p>
<p>6.2 Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required<br />The Offeror shall submit minimum of two and a maximum of four example projects within the past five (5) years to demonstrate specialized experience. The following six (6) criteria will be used:<br />Criterion 1 <br />Demonstrated experience in the investigation of seismic technical issues as identified either as a result of the enforcement of seismic building codes or in the investigation of post-earthquake building performance. Ratings:</p>
<p>Criterion 2 <br />Demonstrated experience in working with academic researchers and research programs in general and the National Science Foundation (NSF) Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) in particular in identifying and utilizing research results to address advanced seismic and seismic-related technical issues.</p>
<p>Criterion 3 <br />Demonstrated experience in the development of government, industry or Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) seismic and seismic-related multi-hazard technical design and construction resource guidance documents and related training products.<br />.</p>
<p>Criterion 4 <br />Demonstrated experience in working with earthquake-related issues such as tsunami and earthquake induced ground failures, including landslide, liquefaction and slumping. This would also include earthquake-induced building failures such as progressive collapse.</p>
<p>Criterion 5 <br />Demonstrated experience in development of training materials and related marketing/ outreach programs that promote use of seismic and multi-hazard technical design and construction guidance products and in conducting such training and outreach programs.</p>
<p>Criterion 6 <br />Demonstrated ability to enlist and subcontract with nationally recognized experts in the following fields: structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, earth science, geotechnical, construction management, code development and enforcement, public policy, training, and academic research.</p>
<p>6.3 Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time<br />This evaluation factor will be assessed from the SF 330 submission identifying "Example projects which best illustrate proposed team's qualifications for this contract". The Offeror shall submit minimum of two and a maximum of four example projects within the past five (5) years. These example projects should be similar to the requirement under this announcement in terms of size (i.e. dollar value), and task length. <br />Since the contractor will be managing multiple task orders simultaneously, the example projects will also demonstrate the contractor's in-house experience in developing and managing multiple complex technical seismic design and construction guidance projects. This requires a demonstrated in-house earthquake engineering capability to ensure satisfactory product quality control.</p>
<p>6.4 Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a minimum of three and a maximum of five references. The attached Past Performance template provides for identification of client's point of contact and should be used to the extent practicable. <br />The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews or to request a written response with points of contact identified in the Past Performance template. In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the respondent.<br />If the past performance references were insufficient to demonstrate meaningful past performance (i.e. less than 3 past performance records, or past performance submissions are not relevant in terms of size, scope and complexity) a neutral rating will be given. A neutral rating will not be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror. If a Neutral rating is made, Past Performance will not be used in the overall rating. <br />6.5 Location in the general geographical area of the project<br />Location is not considered under the evaluation as the application of the work is nationwide. Therefore, location factor will not be used for the evaluation of this requirement.<br />6.6 Acceptability under other appropriate evaluation criteria<br />Program Management Plan (PMP): The PMP should be brief and include an explanation of the firm's management approach, management of subcontractors/consultants (if applicable), specific quality control plan used, and an organizational chart showing the inter-relationships of management and various team components (including subcontractors/consultants). If a Joint Venture (JV) is proposed, the JV inter-relationships shall be described.</p>

Delete: - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for 2 ECL Output systems with an estimated cost of $47,955 in support of the NASA Near Earth Network. NASA Near Earth Network is currently in the process of upgrading a TDRS relay system at McMurdo TDRSS Relay System Upgrade (MTRSU) project.  The Near Earth Network has agreed in a Project Service Level Agreement (PSLA) to deliver mission data at White Sands via clock and data.  In order to convert the files received at White Sands in this format a file play system (or ECL Output System) is required. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Amergint Technologies LLC, because Amergint Technologies LLC proposed the file play back system or ECL Output system that most closely matches the PTP used in our development lab to test the concept. The MTRSU project has determined that no other vendor can provide ECL Output System that would most closely match the current in-lab design and testing that have already conducted.  We hope to use the knowledge and pre-existing work already performed in the lab and make an operational system to support Missions such as SMAP.  Other vendors such as Ingennicom, Avtec, and RT-Logic can provide similar ECL Output Systems, however the additional testing and development needed on a new platform would exceed labor allotment and budget constraints as well as affect the schedule that has a need date of August 31, 2012. All purchases for this project must be made on FY12 dollars, and the project schedule requires that all materials be in hand by August 31, 2012.  Failure to meet the delivery date would greatly impact the implementation of the system in support of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. SMAP is one of four first-tier missions recommended by the National Research Council's Committee on Earth Science and Applications from Space (Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, Space Studies Board, National Academies Press, 2007).  In order to meet the missions goals the MTRSU project needs to complete design, implementation, and testing in less than two years.  In order to make the schedule possible the team has decided to take advantage of hardware that NASA has previously procured to design and develop the McMurdo TDRSS Relay system.  This has reduced costs and saved time by optimizing hardware re-use.  This hardware included an Amergint Programmable Telemetry Processor (PTP), which is basically the same as the ECL Output System, but with more options.  Now that the proof of concept is nearing completion the team needs to procure the operational equipment to be installed at White Sands and McMurdo (this equipment should closely match the Amergint PTP used in the lab development environment to eliminate the possibility of any system interface and operational issues.  A different hardware selection would cause the need for additional interface testing and troubleshooting if problems do arise). Schedule constraints and procurement lead times DO NOT allow for any variation in equipment that would need to go through a concept phase, which would include additional meetings with the vendor, additional testing, and additional proof of concept.	Any additional testing would not only affect the schedule, but the FY12 funding would have expired. Potential vendors and products were identified through Internet searches and vendor representatives were contacted to obtain more technical details when required. This Sole Source Justification is primary based on the fact that units currently exist in a lab environment, which is currently being used to test the system.  Moving that lab environment to an operational state means purchasing a new, prime and spare system that wouldnt be used for development purposes.  From past experience with RT-Logic and Avtec we know the prices would not be competitive.  Ingennicomm Inc would offer a similar price however our team has no experience with their units and there would be a significant learning curve along with the need to purchase additional units for in-lab use.  In this case ALL vendors except Amergint, lack the sufficient testing and interfaces conducted in the Communications Standards and Technology Lab (CSTL).  Something the MTRSU project is leveraging to complete its task. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 304(c) (1) Only One Responsible Source.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on July 3, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombusdsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC intends to procure microgravity flight services from Zero Gravity Corporation.  The Microgravity Services Contract between NASA and Zero G Corporation (ZGC) expires on December 31, 2012.  NASA has a requirement to extend the performance under the current contract for one year with an option to extend the contract for an additional six months. The Microgravity Services Contract requires the contractor to provide a heavy aircraft that is Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified under the appropriate FAA regulation associated with commercial services.  The aircraft operator must also possess FAA authorization to perform parabolic microgravity maneuvers in the aircraft. Microgravity services are currently being performed by ZGC through the use of a B-727 aircraft, which has been modified for microgravity flight.  Per the contract, the aircraft must also be equipped with additional systems and capabilities that can be certified under NASAs airworthiness authority for use as a Public Aircraft, even though these additional systems are not certified for commercial use.	 Upon initiation of a delivery order, the aircraft records are reviewed to ensure compliance with FAA certification requirements.  Following the confirmation of compliance with FAA certification requirements, the non-FAA approved systems are reviewed to ensure compliance with NASA airworthiness requirements and the aircraft is formally transferred to NASA airworthiness authority for flight approval where it remains until the order is complete.  It is the contractors responsibility to ensure the NASA-required systems are disabled or removed as required to conform to FAA certification requirements at the completion of the delivery order.  After each flight period is complete, the aircraft is reconfigured to FAA airworthiness standards and the aircraft is returned to the FAA airworthiness authority.  In summary, the contractor is required to adhere to both FAA and NASA airworthiness requirements. The contractor is also required to furnish the flight crew, cabin crew, and additional flight personnel who are certified to perform microgravity flight services in accordance with NASA requirements.  All aircrew must meet both the FAA and the NASA training standards. The contractor must also provide payload and experiment loading, unloading and installation. The flight profiles required include parabolic maneuvers that duplicate zero-Gravity (0-G), Lunar-Gravity (approximately 1/6th G), Martian gravity (1/3rd G) and multiple other microgravity levels, including hyper-G (greater than 1-G) levels.  Durations required for each gravity level vary with the gravity level, with zero-G as the shortest (approximately 17 seconds) and increasing to 60 seconds for hyper-G levels. Normal delivery orders are flight weeks that require five days presence of the aircraft, with one day devoted to experiment loading and checkout followed by four individual flight days with flights lasting from 1.5 to 2.5 hours each, during which from 30 to 60 parabolas are performed.  Other flight periods of shorter or longer duration may be required, with fewer or greater numbers of flights. The contractor is required to participate in and support Test Readiness Reviews and post flight debriefing sessions. Flight and ground safety are of paramount importance to NASA and deviations from safe operations will not be permitted or accepted.  The contractor is required to provide liability insurance coverage during periods of operation as a Public Aircraft. The primary place of performance will be at the Johnson Space Centers Aircraft Operations Division at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 3, 2012.

INTRODUCTION 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this contract. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective in the contract. 
The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish. 
This QASP is based on the premise the government desires to maintain a quality standard in operating this contract to provide the optimum service. 
The Contractor, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. The Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.

SURVEILLANCE: The COTR will receive complaints from clinic personnel and pass them to the CO for correction. 
STANDARD: The standard is three or less customer complaints per month in each area. The COTR shall notify the contracting officer for appropriate action in accordance with FAR 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items or the appropriate Inspection of Services clause, if any of the above service areas exceed three customer complaints. 
PROCEDURES: Any clinic employee that observes unacceptable services, either incomplete or not performed, for any of the above performance objectives should immediately contact the COTR and the COTR will complete appropriate documentation to record the complaint. The COTR will consider the customer complaint valid upon receipt from the customer. The COTR should inform the customer of the approximate time the unacceptable performance will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the COTR if not corrected. The Contractor will be given two hours after verbal notification to correct the unacceptable performance. If the Contractor disagrees with the complaint after investigation of the site and challenges the validity of the complaint, the Contractor will notify the COTR. The COTR will conduct determine the validity of the complaint. If the COTR determines the complaint as invalid, he will document the written complaint of the findings and notify the customer. The COTR will retain documentation for his/her files. If after investigation the COTR determines the complaint as valid, the COTR will inform the Contractor, and the Contractor will be given an additional hour to correct the defect. A defect will not be recorded if proper and timely correction of the unacceptable condition(s) is accomplished. 
Emergency or Special Microfiber Cleaning Products/Uniforms/Necessary Linens
Ordered services meet the requirements of the contract as appropriate.     Performance Threshold:    100% of the time. 
SURVEILLANCE: The COTR will evaluate the services required by each delivery order to ensure compliance. 
PROCEDURES: The government COTR will inspect all work tasks required by the task or delivery order to ensure Contractor compliance with the appropriate paragraphs of the Statement of Work (SOW) each time the service(s) is performed.  Notify the contract manager or CONTRACTOR of the deficiencies for correction. The Contractor shall be given two hours after notification to correct the unacceptable performance.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the MATRICS Assessment, Inc. for the measurement and treatment of research to improve cognition in schizophrenia. MATRICS Assessment Inc. will translate a performance-based functional assessment battery into five languages to accompany the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) for use in clinical trials; to translate the MCCB into Brazilian-Portuguese for use in clinical trials; and to collect German normative data for use in developing a normative-based scoring program for the German translated version of the MCCB. To facilitate treatment development of treatments for cognition in schizophrenia, the NIMH supported a process (i.e., MATRICS) to achieve a broad evidence-based consensus regarding the best available method for measuring cognition in pharmacological trials targeting the cognitive deficits of this disorder. The individual tests selected through this process have been obtained, in some instances licensed from their owners, and packaged for easy administration by academic and industry clinical investigators. In addition, a standardized test kit of test materials and a technical manual with instructions for test administration has been created. To be of maximal utility to those concerned with drug development, the MCCB must be adapted for use in other countries. The overall goal of this purchase order is to start the initial process of translation and adaptation of foreign language versions of the MCCB consistent with the overall MATRICS approach. Period of performance is 12 months.</p>

<CONTACT>Kathleen E Reidy, Contract Specialist / Contracting Officer, Email kathleen.reidy@bep.gov - Berel Dorfman, Lead Contract Specialist, Email berel.dorfman@bep.gov
<DESC>Portable Currency Reader Device Request for Information
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>
<p><br />The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating portable currency readers that denominate U.S. currency (Federal Reserve notes) produced from 1995 to present.</p>
<p>As a follow up to Request for Information (RFI) No. BEP-RFI-11-0014, BEP is issuing a new request for information. This RFI is for both manufacturers and re-sellers of currently available currency reader devices. BEP is issuing this RFI as a white paper request from the vendor community to provide information to assist BEP in developing its meaningful access program. This white paper is part of BEP's market research.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />On October 3, 2008 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued its ruling in ACB vs. Paulson requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to provide meaningful access to U.S. currency for the blind and visually impaired by the next currency redesign. Even before the Court's ruling, BEP commissioned a study to review and analyze the needs of the blind and visually impaired. The study can be found on BEP's website at http://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/meaningfulaccess.html. After the completion of the study, BEP proposed three recommended accommodations, which the Secretary of the Treasury has approved:</p>
<p>1. Tactile Feature: Adding a raised tactile feature to U.S. currency unique to each U.S. Federal Reserve note that BEP may lawfully change.</p>
<p>2. High Contrast Numerals: Continuing the program of adding large, high-contrast numerals and different colors to each denomination that BEP is permitted by law to alter.</p>
<p>3. Currency Reader Program: A supplemental currency reader distribution program for blind and visually impaired U.S. citizens and those legally residing in the U.S.</p>
<p>BEP will establish a process to loan and distribute currency readers to the blind and visually impaired at no cost to them as an interim solution to provide accessibility to U.S. currency. The potential currency reader loan program will be implemented prior to the distribution and full circulation of the currency redesigned with tactile features.</p>
<p>Based on the study findings, the number of blind or visually impaired individuals who found it difficult or impossible to denominate U.S. currency visually was estimated to be 4,371,369. The study projected this number to increase to 4,895,933 individuals by 2020. BEP makes no guarantee as to the number of currency reader devices that may be required under its currency reader distribution program.</p>
<p>Submissions under this white paper may include a working currency reader device which will be assessed for compatibility with current U.S. currency designs and will be reviewed for inherent, relative effectiveness as a currency reader device. All submitted devices will be returned at the end of the market research process. Although the submission of a device is not required, it is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR WHITE PAPER:<br />In order to develop an effective currency reader distribution program, BEP seeks to better understand the current and potential market for currency readers, including the range of models and features available to U.S. individuals, manufacturing processes, re-seller distribution methods and related cost.</p>
<p>Respondents are asked to provide information in response to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; A brief description of your company's history and its experience in manufacturing and distributing or re-selling a currency reader device.<br />&bull; Company name, point of contact, email address, telephone number and web address.<br />&bull; Describe how the device denominates U.S. currency.<br />&bull; Describe the features of the device, including any of the following that apply: dimension, weight, voice options, languages, privacy mode, accuracy, speed, power source and other features. <br />&bull; Describe any attributes that improve ease of use of the device by the blind and visually impaired.<br />&bull; What is the current retail unit price for the device, including shipping?

How are these materials distributed to the end user? <br />&bull; Describe what information you have available online.<br />&bull; What customer support do you provide to those who need assistance using the device? What customer support is provided if there is a warranty issue with the device? <br />&bull; Does the device have a unique identifier, such as a serial number? Can the manufacturer/re-seller accommodate this if required? How would this affect the unit price? What are your parameters with applying serial numbers to each reader device? <br />&bull; Do you anticipate enhancements/upgrades to this device within the next 6 months? Within the next year? Within in the next 3 to 5 years?<br />&bull; How do you currently handle customer support for devices that arrive damaged?

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to gain knowledge of potentially interested and qualified sources. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Information should focus on the capability to provide the technical support services defined below. Standard company brochures are not desired.<br />The United States Air Force seeks to procure contractor support to provide IT services to support approximately 200 users. The software used by the United States Air Force is significantly more sophisticated than typical office automation: including specialized operations research models, mathematical optimization, and other general tools associated with operations research. The computational heart of the organization is located in a SCIF with specialized analytic architectures that combine UNIX (Solaris, IRIX, and/or LINUX) with Windows in stand-alone networks. These architectures are selectively combined and modified in some instances to run on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) with AF Enterprise office automation applications. The architecture is further abstracted into another subset that runs on the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), which, while centrally managed under a separate contract by another organization, will require first-tier Client Support Technician (CST) troubleshooting and remediation support from this contract.<br />A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is available below. To evaluate the potential number of vendors capable of adequately performing under the United States Air Force PWS, a thorough review of capability statements will be conducted. Interested parties who believe they have the ability to provide the required services are invited to supply a capabilities statement of no more than twenty (20) pages. Capability statements must include: <br />1. Complete Business Name, including DUNS Number <br />2. Contact Information (Respondent's name and title, address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail) <br />3. Business Size and Classification (small, small-disadvantaged, SBA Certified 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled, veteran-owned etc). <br />Capability statements must address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to the key task areas detailed in the draft PWS.<br />The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods. The Government intends to issue the solicitation in May 2012 after a pre-solicitation notice is published as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2. The procurement strategy will be determined in part by the responses to this notice. <br />All interested parties believing they can provide the required services as defined in the United States Air Force PWS are invited to submit the above documentation. Responses should be e-mailed to Contract Specialist via the e-mail link below.
<p>ALL INFORMATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN 2:00 PM EDT WEDNESDAY, MARCH 23, 2012. No feedback or evaluations will be provided to concerns regarding the information submitted to Air Force District of Washington/PKS. Please direct any questions you may have regarding this notice in writing to Contract Specialist Martha Warren (Ctr).</p>
<p>The point of contact for this procurement is Martha Warren, Contract Specialist, (Ctr) at martha.warren.ctr@afncr.af.mil.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD) was established in November 1977 to provide medical care for critically ill patients throughout the Clinical Center who have potentially reversible medical problems. Critical care medicine may be defined as the observation, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients with overt or potential failure of vital functions.</p>
<p>The Department is currently composed of the following sections:</p>
<p>&bull; Clinical Medical Services<br />&bull; Critical Care Therapy and Respiratory Care<br />&bull; Research Section<br />&bull; AIDS Section<br />&bull; Administrative Services</p>
<p>The mission of the Department is to (a) provide superb care for Clinical Center patients who may benefit from critical care services, (b) improve both understanding and management of the critical disease processes, c) train health care professionals to understand, provide, and improve critical care services.</p>
<p>The activities of the Department have been directed principally towards:</p>
<p>&bull; Organizing, developing and maintaining a medical facility capable of providing a full spectrum of superb critical care and specialized outpatient services to the Clinical Center 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintaining a consultative service to assist in the management and care of critically ill patients throughout the Clinical Center.</p>
<p>&bull; Managing emergency services such as the "code blue" cardiac arrest team.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintaining an educational and training program in critical care for therapists, nursing and physician staffs.</p>
<p>&bull; Providing national leadership in directing the standards and goals of critical care clinical practice, training, and research.</p>
<p>CCMD Mission</p>
<p>To provide high quality and cost effective clinical service that meets the needs of CC patients and NIH Institutes, to facilitate the research goals of NIH Institutes and investigators, and to conduct high quality research and training in Critical Care Medicine.</p>
<p><br />2. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this SOW is to secure the services of adult airway training for the CCMD Clinical Fellows and Senior Staff. The Clinical Fellows and Senior Staff are unable to receive this training from the Clinical Center's (CC) Anesthesia Department due to the low volume of intubations performed in their operating room and narrow spectrum of pathology. The primary purpose is to assure the CCMD Clinical Fellows and Attendings are properly trained and competent to place airways in adult CC patients on an elective and emergent basis. The Clinical Center's Anesthesia department is not in-house 24/7 and the responsibility for airway emergencies falls to the CCMD Clinical Fellows and Attending at night, weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>If patients have airway emergencies and an airway cannot be established within 1-5 minutes, depending on the scenario, death or permanent disability will result. The hospital has an ethical imperative to provide qualified staff to handle this expected emergency, and CCMD has been designated as the responsible entity. Moreover, the liability entailed in having suboptimal training is enormous, as is the political liability for the organization if an adverse outcome occurs due to poor staff training.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to solicit a quote and enter into a contract with Life Technologies, Inc. herein referred to as Contractor for Ion Proton Semiconductor Sequencing System which is the only source for this item. The anticipated award date is on or about June 25, 2012. The Bacterial Foodborne Pathogen and Mycology Unit at NCAUR has a need for a Ion Proton Semiconductor Sequencing System. After Market research and Publishing of Sources Sought it is determined that there is only one source available for the type equipment. The existing research uses optimized protocols to process DNA Samples on this particular type of sequencing platforms. The research unit currently has a smaller less productive version of this instrument. Acquisition of a differing type of DNA sequencing platform would result in additional costs to the unit and research delays while samples are optimized to another platform.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this action is 334516. ARS requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following website: http://www.ccr.govl CCR.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responsible sources received within five days of this posting. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona-fide capability to fulfill the requirement. If no written responses are received after the publication of this notice the purchase will be awarded without further notice. Please email Contract Specialist, Mark O. Volk with responses or questions regarding this requirement at Mark.Volk@ars.usda.gov.<br /><br />JOFOC (Attached) Life Technologies, 850 Lincoln Center Drive, Foster City, CA 94582</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Pacific West Area, under the authority of FAR 13.0 intends to negotiate on a sole source (Allegheny Singer Research Institute) basis for a service where ARS provides the genomic DNA of each of 20 bacterial DNA samples and the source will do the actual genome sequencing using the PacBio technology. The product ARS will get back is the genome sequence data for each of the 20 bacterial genomes. The PacBio technology is fundamentally different from all preceding methods as it utilizes a zero mode waveguide (ZMW) for imaging of the DNA polymerase as it adds each base in real time. No other method employs an actual DNA polymerase for sequencing. The advantages of this approach are based upon the fact that two types of DNA sequence can be obtained from the system. The first type of data is termed long-read data and is produced by taking advantage of the natural processivity of the DNA polymerase. This type of sequencing routinely produces single reads that are 3-5 kilobases (Kb) in length, with some reads in excess of 10 Kb. These data are used for building long scaffolds such that the number of contigs produced for a given genome are greatly reduced (2-3x) compared to even 454 Lifesciences' based sequencing, thereby providing a much more finished product without having to do any additional gap filling. The individual error rate for these long reads is relatively high. Therefore, the long-read data are combined with a second type of Pacbio sequencing, termed circular consensus sequencing (CCS). The CCS reads are much shorter than the long-reads, but because each base is read multiple times as the polymerase travels around the circle, they are also much more accurate. This is because the errors made by the Pacbio system are truly random, thus as the number of reads/base goes up the error rate goes down for all bases including homopolymer tracts. In essence then, the CCS reads are used to error-correct the long-reads which produces long accurate reads in the final analysis. For bacterial genome samples, the data generated using PacBio long read/CCS generates genome sequence data with fewer gaps relative to older generation sequencing platforms. This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. ARS believes that Allegheny Singer Research Institute is the only source that can provide the required services. Interested Firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the above stated requirement and submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 4:00 PM 06/27/2012 (Pacific Time) will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Proposal must be sent in writing referencing AG-32SD-S-12-0037 to the attention of Vinay B. Kaul via fax 510-559-6023, or emailed to vinay.kaul@ars.usda.gov.

The contract was competitively awarded to Crew Training International, Inc. to provide Contract Aircrew Training and Courseware Development to prepare aircrews to fly MQ-1/9 in support of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) combat missions. Guidance in the 2012 Defense Priorities and Choices document states, &ldquo;to fund enough trained personnel, infrastructure and platforms to sustain 65 USAF MQ-1/9 CAPs, with a surge capability to 85 CAPS.&rdquo; In order to meet this requirement, the AF has increased MQ-1/9 Formal Training Units (FTU) from one location at Creech AFB, NV to a total of four locations to include: Holloman AFB, NM; March ANGB, CA; and Hancock ANGB, NY. Over the four years of the current contract&rsquo;s performance, annual aircrew training requirements have grown from a student Program Flying Training (PFT) rate of approximately120 aircrew to an FY13 PFT of 450 aircrews, a 275% increase. The exercise of Option Year 4 will increase the contract value by approximately $26M and will permit the continuation of performance of the current contract while the requirement is recompeted. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611512, Flight Training. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS and no solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirement on 1 Oct 2012 may give written notification to the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source

<ARCHDATE>07052012
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:NMLC-Resarch@med.navy.mil">NMLC Research</a>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to Oak Hill Genetics for an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract that provides for the delivery of healthy male and female Yorkshire swine for a period of 36-months.  The animals (swine) shall be healthy, disease free and at the required weight in 100% of the ordered quantity in each delivery, or entire shipment shall be replaced.  The animal facility requires United States Department of Agriculture approved Class A animal breeder license. The requirement shall have an environment, care and handling of animals as developed by the current supplier to avoid the skewing of data in ongoing research efforts.
  

Currently, Naval Medical Research Unit  San Antonio (NAMRU-SA), is using the government purchase card to buy animals (swine) from Oak Hills Genetics, Inc.   NAMRU-SA has been using Oak Hills Genetics for past animal (swine) purchases in research that focuses on the protection, resuscitation and stabilization of combat casualties at Echelon 1 and 2 points of care in the combat theater.  In the upcoming months, the number of animals necessary for purchase will increase to a level that exceeds the authority to purchase under the Government purchase card program.  

It is critical for NAMRU-SA future scientific research efforts to have healthy, disease free animals from one vender; this will ensure the scientific data generated is consistent, which is critical when testing different vender devices under that same research environment.
  

Due to Oak Hill Genetics early involvement providing animals in this ongoing research effort; they must continue to provide this supply until commencement as to avoid the injection of inconsistency in study results.  In addition, it is imperative that a comparison of previous data collected in ongoing research, to potentially new data be created, collected, and reviewed under the same controls to ensure an apples-to-apples analysis is been  performed.  This is critical to the integrity of the entire study and can only be accomplished through the use of the same supplier.  In addition, Oak Hill Genetics has an established history of delivering 100% healthy lots.  Loss of one or two animals due to diseases will cause a major disruption on data collection and data analysis.
  

Further, the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which provides regulatory oversight in federally funded projects requiring animal use, requires proof that the research team is working to reduce the number of animals used in the protocols as the study progresses.  This can only be accomplished by using the current vendor, as this supplier eliminates the need to acquire additional animals through duplication of previous study efforts.     

The estimated value of this contract is $450,000.00. The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a base period of 12-months, followed by two 12-month option periods for a total of 36-months.  Previous to purchases from Oak Hill Genetics with the Government purchase card, market research was conducted by NAMRU-SA, it found that other animal venders could have been used in the past, but prior to use, the animals became sick and had to be euthanized.
  

If future requirements exist that do not involve the same research efforts, the government will solicit through full and open competition to remove barriers.

All capability statements received by 10:00AM Eastern Time on July 5, 2012, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), Yuma, Arizona, 85364, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis as provided under FAR 6.302-3; Industrial mobilization; engineering, development, or research capability; or expert services with Graver Water Systems, 675 Central Avenue Suite 3, New Providence, NJ 07974. The requirement is for removal and replacement of an entire Reactivator Assembly inside an existing 32' diameter by 22' high concrete tank located in the Pilot System 1 (PS1) Desalination Plant.  The work is located about 4 miles west of Yuma, Arizona, in Yuma County, at the Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Desalting Complex. The principal features of work to be performed under this solicitation/specification consists of:  1) Predesign Inspection Trip to the Site; 2) Design and Fabrication of a complete Reactivator Assembly equivalent to the existing Reactivator designed and installed by Graver Water in 1984; 3) Removal of existing Reactivator assembly; 4) Installation of new Reactivator Assembly; 5) Performance Test. Graver Water System's unique qualification is that they supplied the very large Reactivators, 185' in diameter, in the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP). They have the proprietary knowledge necessary to ensure the function of the smaller Reactivator, which this contract is for, is identical to the behavior of the larger Reactivators across all operating ranges and conditions, e.g. pH, salinity, TDS, lime loading, bicarbonate removal, etc.  
The PS1 is a 1/100th scale model of the YDP, functionally identical to the larger plant.  Congress required the PS1 be built in conjunction with the YDP so that new technologies could be tested and proved in a scale model before implementation in the larger production plant. Implementation of new water treatment technologies in the YDP is a very costly affair and potentially disruptive to the Water Treaty with Mexico. If the scale model, PS1, which is used in the proving of these new technologies, is in any way different than the full scale model, the scale model will be flawed.  Implementing a new treatment process in the YDP based on a flawed model could result in a very costly and disruptive mistake.  Additionally, all the testing that was performed in the pilot plant would have been wasted effort and time. 
The NAICS Code for this action is 237110 Water & Sewer Line & Related Structures Construction with a Small Business Size Standard of $33.5 million.
This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 15 Negotiation procedures on a Firm Fixed Price Basis.  Anticipated award date is August 1, 2012.   
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency by June 22, 2012.
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made available for public inspection as required by FAR 6.305. 
Questions and capability statements may be submitted to Jacqueline Carrera, Contract Specialist, YAO-3100, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ 85364, Facsimile (928) 343-8568, or via email at jcarrera@usbr.gov.

<p><br />INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, CBP requires the services of skilled and knowledgeable individuals (i.e., contractors) on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 calendar days or less.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Note:</strong> This is an annual notice, for Intermittent Contractors (Subject Matter Experts), announcing CBP's process and giving interested individuals and firms an opportunity to apply (see process below). There are no known immediate requirements but new requirements for these services may arise at any time. This notice will remain open and the opportunity for individuals/firms to apply will continue until this notice is modified to the contrary or canceled. The previous announcement/notice on this subject published at www.fbo.gov 10/7/2011 (#CBP-IC-2011-1) is canceled and superseded by this notice.</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT EXAMPLES: The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of an order/contract.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While minor elements of performance under an order/contract may be performed in the United States (such as but not limited to meeting with program officials in Washington, DC or in other domestic locales, telephonic and/or email correspondence, etc.), primary performance of assignments is outside of the United States.<br /><br />1) Training: The IC may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter.

In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.</p>
<p>2) Course Development: The IC may be required to develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors, as required. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.</p>
<p>3) Assessments: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries, as required. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction, assessment of aviation equipment assets or of aviation programs, intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare summaries, analyses, recommendations, trip reports, and/or other written work product(s).</p>
<p>4) Technical Assistance: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.</p>
<p>5) Augmentation of a Team: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member.

<p>CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Both individuals and organizations are welcome to apply. Applications are to be submitted on an individual basis (one for each proposed IC applicant/person). Interested parties are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR available at FedBizOpps (accompanies this Notice). Beginning with the date of this notice, all applicants must submit the most recent revision of the questionnaire (currently Rev 8-07) in order to be considered.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf. A copy of the 6/2006 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.</p>
<p>Resume packages (i.e., resume &amp; completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only.</p>
<p>INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS/FIRMS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO:</p>
<p>CBPIC@cbp.dhs.gov</p>
<p>DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. A representative of the designated receiving office (above) will acknowledge receipt of applications via email within 5 business days of receipt. If no acknowledgement is received within 5 business days after transmitting, applicants are encouraged to follow up by sending an email inquiry to the email address above to ensure receipt of their applications. If for some reason, the applicant still does not receive a response, the applicant is encouraged to follow up with the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Applicants who applied under a previous notice/announcement are encouraged to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.</p>
<p>METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which IC candidates are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. CBP will select the most highly qualified and available candidate for each given requirement.</p>
<p>Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above.</p>
<p>ICs are required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage when traveling to foreign locations. The order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). In situations where an IC currently has emergency evacuation insurance coverage in place which will extend through the period of proposed performance, new coverage need not be obtained. In such cases, the IC must present written proof of coverage to the officer making the inquiry as to availability before an order will be placed.</p>
<p>REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered and have "ACTIVE" status in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&amp;B number. Applicants must include their D&amp;B/DUNs # on the questionnaire (see above).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Applicants must follow up this process aggressively to ensure that ACTIVE status is attained. Registration data is valid for one year and must be updated at time of expiration in order for status to remain ACTIVE.</p>
<p>ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP officer will contact the applicant and inquire as to availability for an assignment. If the selected applicant is available and all requirements are satisfied, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html).The order/contract will be in the form of an unpriced purchase order awarded in accordance with FAR 13.302-2. The order document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, other applicable information, fixed hourly rates established in this notice, and a price ceiling. The Contracting Officer will submit the completed order/contract document to the selected IC for review, concurrence, and acceptance. The order will become a legal binding contract once the Contracting Officer receives written acceptance from the IC. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides necessary additional funding and authorization for continued performance within specified limits.</p>
<p>ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING AND PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by payment terms incorporated into FAR clause 52.213-4. ICs shall be paid for services ordered and performed in accordance with the order, not to exceed the order ceiling. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) later in Calendar Year 2012, for Technical Support Services for the US Navys Dry Deck Shelters (DDS). The DDS, when installed on a Host Submarine, provides the capability to support various Special Operating Forces (SOF) missions.  The DDS Technical Support Services Contract will primarily include the following efforts:


1.  To develop DDS Field Changes (FCs), designs, kit ups and installations as tasked. 


2.  Execute Regular Overhaul (ROH) to 3 DDS.  DDS ROHs are 90 Days in duration.  DDS-02P occurs in FY13, DDS-05S occurs in FY-16 and DDS-03P occurs in FY17.  This includes pre-ROH planning efforts.


3.  Execute DDS Restricted Availabilities (RAVs) on an average of 3 DDS per FY.
  DDS RAVs are 60 Days in duration.  This includes pre-RAV planning efforts.  Technical Availabilities (TAVs) will be assigned by Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) on an as needed basis.


4.  Execute DDS Initial Fit-Ups (IFUs) or DDS Crossfits as tasked.  These efforts are 70 days in duration, including pierside, unmanned and manned post production work testing.


5.  Execute DDS Emergent Inspection and Repair as tasked by WARCOM and/or NSWG-3.  This could involve travel to forward sites, outside CONUS.


6.  Maintain the DDS Rotatable Pool and associated Government Furnished Property (GFP), along with equipment and/or tooling which is unique to the DDS Program and which is not normally stocked by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or Naval Supply System (NAVSUP).


7.
  Provide DDS Engineering/Technical Services.  This is Waterfront Engineering/Technical Support for ROHs, RAVs, TAVs and Emergent Inspections and Repair taskings.


In support of this DDS Technical Support Services Solicitation effort, the Government will hold an Industry Day on USS Florida (SSGN 728) with DDS-03P and DDS-05S installed, at the Trident Refit Facility (TRF), Kings Bay, GA on 16 Feb 2012.  In addition to making one of these two DDS and their interface with the Host Submarines (HOSUB) Battle Management Center (BMC) available for review by any potential bidders, Naval Special Warfare Group  Three Detachment Little Creek, VA (NSWG-3 Det LC) personnel will provide all attendees an overview of DDS operations and NAVSEA will provide an overview of the planned scope of the DDS Technical Support Services Contract.
 Attendees will be afforded the opportunity to ask questions about DDS operations or the planned DDS Program Technical Services Support efforts during the Industry Day. The Government may not respond to any specific questions or comments regarding the effort in response to this special notice until that time.


All interested parties shall submit their intent to participate to Stephen Walsh, NAVSEA PMS399A2, stephen.t.walsh@navy.mil, Debra Mackall, NASVEA 02642, debra.mackall@navy.mil and Scott Henderson, NASVEA 02642H, scott.s.henderson@navy.mil, the Government POCs for this effort, before 2 Feb 2012. The agenda for the Industry Day will be promulgated by 8 Feb 2012 to all parties expressing interest.


Parties are requested to forward security clearance information (visit requests) for all attendees to CWO3 Charles Senter via JPAS (SMO Code N611076, Ref: DDS Industry Day).
  For parties not having access to JPAS, security clearance information shall be submitted via OPNAV Form 5521/27, which shall be faxed to (912)573-2172.  THE CLEARANCE REQUESTS MUST REQUEST ACCESS TO ZONE 3 (SSGN 728), ZONE 7 (WATERFRONT) AND ZONE 12 (BASIN AREA). FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN DENIAL OF ACCESS TO THE FULL SCOPE OF THE INDUSTRY DAY AGENDA.  The CSS-16 POC is CWO3 Charles Senter.  The NSSC POCs are ETC Gunther C. Helms, FTC David W. Williamson and FTC William C. Green.


Due to space constraints, each organization shall limit attendance to three representatives.  For security or facility questions call (912)573-0866. TRF KB requires 7 working days to process clearance requests, so these requests shall be submitted NLT 8 Feb 2012.


The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this notice.
 This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.

The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.
Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. 
The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 
The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.
Price proposals shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1. Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc); 2. Indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  3.

Offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor, if applicable. The offeror has public access at http://www.dol.gov/ to locate the prevailing wage rates for their area.  
The Government reserves the right to make award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in the proposal. Omissions of response may be considered non-responsive and may not be evaluated. If exchanges are necessary, the Government will conduct exchanges consistent with FAR 15.306, Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals.

SECTION M. PART B. BASIS OF AWARD
The Government will evaluate each offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness. The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.
Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. 
The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 
The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.
Price proposals shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1.	Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc); 2.	Indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  3.	Inclusive of any Federal, State, and Local taxes, in accordance with FAR 52.212-4 (k) Taxes, FAR 52.229-01, FAR 52.229-04 and FAR 52.229-10.  
Offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor, if applicable. The offeror has public access at http://www.dol.gov/ to locate the prevailing wage rates for their area.  
The Government reserves the right to make award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in the proposal. Omissions of response may be considered non-responsive and may not be evaluated. If exchanges are necessary, the Government will conduct exchanges consistent with FAR 15.306, Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals. 
An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract or purchase order from the Federal Government pursuant to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008).

The evaluation factors other than price are as follows in ascending order of importance: (a) Past Performance; (b) Knowledge and Experience; and (c) Technical Capability.

The offeror has public access to locate the prevailing wage rates for all areas at the following website: http://www.dol.gov/.  
BASIS OF AWARD:
The Government will make an award based upon best value. Evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. The evaluation factors other than price are as follows in ascending order of importance: (a) Past Performance; (b) Knowledge and Experience; and (c) Technical Capability. Best overall value to the Government will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit with differences in price. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior quality. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior technical merit.
The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in the proposal.

The offeror has public access to locate the prevailing wage rates for all areas at the following website: http://www.dol.gov/.

The evaluation factors other than price are as follows in ascending order of importance: (a) Past Performance; (b) Knowledge and Experience; and (c) Technical Capability. Best overall value to the Government will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit with differences in price.

The technical approach shall include, but is not be limited to the following: (a) Description of the processes the offeror routinely uses to provide speech and language therapy services, and (b) Description of the conditions and challenges which can affect achieving the Bureau of Indian Affair's goals and objectives.
PRICE FACTOR:
The Government will evaluate each offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness. The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. The price detail shall include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.
Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. 
The Government will review: (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and (3) whether an award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 
The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; as priced according to the following CLIN's (form 1449):
CLIN 1: Base Period, Contract Award to August 1, 2013 $_______________ CLIN 2: Option Period One, July 31, 2013 to August 1, 2014 $_______________ CLIN 3: Option Period Two, July 31, 2014 to August 1, 2015 $_______________ CLIN 4: Option Period Three, July 31, 2015 to August 1, 2016 $_______________ CLIN 5: Option Period Four, July 31, 2016 to August 1, 2017 $_______________ 
Total Price: $___________________
Price proposals shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1.	The price per hour; or price per day; or price per service unit/student. 2.	Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, etc); 3.	Indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  4.	Inclusive of any Federal, State, and Local taxes, in accordance with FAR 52.212-4, and FAR 52.229-04.  
If applicable, offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor. The offeror has public access to locate the prevailing wage rates for all areas at the following website: http://www.dol.gov/.  
BASIS OF AWARD:
The Government will make an award based upon best value. Evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. The evaluation factors other than price are as follows in ascending order of importance: (a) Past Performance; (b) Knowledge and Experience; and (c) Technical Capability. Best overall value to the Government will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit with differences in price. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior quality. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior technical merit.
The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in the proposal. Omissions of response may be considered non-responsive and may not be evaluated. If exchanges are necessary, the Government will conduct exchanges consistent with FAR 15.306, Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals. 
The Contractor shall have a favorable background/screening determination issued by the Bureau of Indian Education Security Office.
An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract or purchase order from the Federal Government pursuant to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008).

Is it reinforced concrete? Are there any available access points for us to put our wiring through on the ceiling or through the wall?  If not, are you wanting us to drill a hole through the vault? Also, how far would the cameras be from the monitors (wire distance).
Answer: There are some existing access points where other wires/cables already run (via conduit/piping) into the vaults. Could possibly use those same access points. If those points are full, might need to drill. One vault is concrete and steel. The other vault is steel plate.  The vendor who installed the last batch of cameras did not seem to have too much trouble getting the wires into the vaults.
The Distance from the cameras to the monitors would be approx 30 feet. <BR> <BR>

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to a six (6) months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Solicitation 3QSA-JB-100001-B, Refresh #6, is being issued to update current laws and regulations.

Special Item Numbers (SIN) 711-4 Blueprint Filing Cabinets, 711-5 Card Files, 711-6 Form Files, 711-12 System Type Tables and Accessories, 711-14 - Vertical Surface Attachment Panels and Accessories, 711-20 Display and Communication Boards, Wall Stations, Lecterns, and Accessories, 711-92 - Remanufactured Furniture, 71-202 Wall Units, 71-203 Loft Groups, 71-304 Lecterns, 71-305 Library Furniture, 71-306 Mail Sorting and Distribution Furniture, 71-308 Cafeteria and Food Service Furniture, 71-312 Hazardous Materials Storage, 71-317 Chair, Convalescent, and 71-321 Correctional Institution Furniture are 100% small business set-aside.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provided instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 3QSA-JB-100001-B (include the dashes).

NOTE:  ALL OFFERS AND MODIFICATION REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS AN EOFFER/EMOD (http://eoffer.gsa.gov/).  PAPER OR HARD COPY OFFERS/MODIFICATION REQUESTS ARE NO LONGER BEING ACCEPTED AND WILL BE REJECTED.

Contracting questions should be directed to email address schedule71@gsa.gov or 703-605-9978.  If you already have a GSA contact, please contact your assigned Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer directly.

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous. Resultant contracts will be for five (5) years, with three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty (20) years if performance is satisfactory. The options are not guaranteed. Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! Program. None of these options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! Website. All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage! website. All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<p>1. DESCRIPTION OF WORK:<br />The Government requires a comprehensive analytical tool, TDA Solution software, to assist investigators and analysts in analyzing and presenting findings of voluminous amounts of unstructured and structured evidentiary material used in investigations conducted by FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI). As described below, the TDA solution must be capable to extract entities and identify relationships with full integration of a visualization tool to present such findings. Where indicated, the TDA Solution must utilize "out of the box" functionality to accomplish tasks. Due to the sensitivity of the evidentiary material, open source plug-ins or software cannot be utilized.</p>
<p>2. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:<br />Text and Data Extraction and Classification:<br />a. The TDA Solution must be able to process various Optical Character Recognition or searchable file formats such as but not limited to PDFs, Text Files, XML, Microsoft Office formats, and various email formats.

<p>b. The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" functionality to extract and classify text and data by entities.</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must be capable of accepting custom libraries or dictionaries as designated by FDA-OCI. Once these libraries and dictionaries are incorporated, the TDA Solution must be able to extract and classify the data. This includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceuticals, food products and additives, and medical devices.</p>
<p>Text/Data Parsing:<br />The TDA Solution must be able to parse fields containing structured data and extract and classify data by entity of the parsed fields on at least five forms designation by FDA-OCI. The data extraction from this process will be combined with extractions from unstructured data.</p>
<p>Relationship Identification:<br />The TDA Solution must be capable to use "out of the box" functionality to identify relationships between entities. This includes "out of the box" functionality to identify and tag financial relationships between entities. <br /><br />Sentiment of Written Communication:<br />The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" capability to determine the sentiment of written statements in unstructured text. The sentiment analysis includes the following:</p>
<p>&bull;Sentiment, characteristics of the entities of the sentiment, attributes<br />&bull;Sentiment, problem expressed by the sentiment, major, minor<br />&bull;Sentiment, requests and questions associated with the sentiment, new, existing, contact<br />&bull;Sentiment, strong positive, week positive, neutral, weak negative, strong negative</p>
<p>Data Cleansing and Disambiguation:<br />The TDA Solution must include the "out of the box" functionality to determine judgments regarding disambiguation of different but similar description of entities. This includes determining that variations of a name or an address are actually one person and address, respectively. Further, the TDA Solution must be capable to standardize this data and combine into single or reduced entity identification.</p>
<p>Search and Viewer:<br />The TDA Solution must include "out of the box" functionality to search, discover, and analyze by various methods and techniques.</p>
<p>Once entities are extracted and relationships identified, the TDA Solution must be capable of pointing to the source image containing the entity or relationship. This includes a viewer that will show the results of an entity or relationship search in PDF and Text File formats. The viewer will highlight the specific location of the entity or relationship in the PDF and Text File.</p>
<p>Visualization Tool:<br />The TDA Solution must include a fully integrated visualization tool with the text and data extraction and relationship identification as described above. The vendor must present documentation to demonstrate that the tool is integrated with these attributes as part of the award. Development and integration of a visualization tool with text and data extraction and relationship identification during configuration, testing and deployment of the TDA Solution is not permitted. The visualization tool must allow for the automated extraction of identified entities and relationships into the visualization tool. This includes icons or labels to identify entities and relationships. This must also include the "out of the box" identification and labeling of financial transactions between entities. The visualization tool must allow the end user to search by entities and to crate visualization reports or graphical representations of the search results. The above described viewer will be fully integrated with the visualization tool, as it will allow the end user view the source images based on the search criteria. The visualization tool must be capable of allowing the end user to filter results in order to focus on key investigative findings. The visualization tool must also be able to demonstrate results using link analysis, graphical, statistical, and geographical charts or tables.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>CULTURAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT SECTION 106 COMPLIANCE FOR HAWAIIAN MONK SEAL RECOVERY ACTIONS PEIS.</p>
<p><br />1. Background</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO), Protected Resources Division (PRD) is dedicated to protecting and recovering endangered and threatened species of sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans as mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Through management, conservation and recovery efforts, and public outreach and education, PRD strives to ensure the recovery and survival of the protected marine species of the Pacific Islands Region for future generations.<br /><br />Currently, recovery of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal is a high priority for NMFS. The future of Hawaiian monk seals appears dire at present, with a current population of less than 1,200 that is declining at a rate of about 4% per year. Low survival of juvenile seals is the principal cause for population decline in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where threats include food limitation, entanglement in marine debris, and shark predation on seal pups. In the main Hawaiian Islands, juvenile survival is currently not a concern, yet seals face other threats related to human disturbance, potential infectious disease outbreaks, fishery impacts, and recently, apparent intentional deaths caused by humans.<br /><br />Despite the challenges to Hawaiian monk seal recovery mentioned above, a growing number of Native Hawaiians leaders, cultural practitioners and local community members have begun to support conservation of Hawaiian monk seals as an indigenous Hawaiian species. NMFS' work to date with some of these community members has included participating in meetings and consultations with practitioners and community leaders on various islands to discuss community concerns and questions regarding NMFS monk seal recovery activities, and supporting community leaders from neighbor islands to travel to Oahu to participate in meetings and outreach activities related to monk seal recovery. Through the project described in this statement of work, PRD seeks to continue this productive collaboration with Native Hawaiian organizations (NHO's), practitioners, and community leaders regarding Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions.</p>
<p>NMFS is developing a Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Actions Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (DPEIS) that details several newly-developed and proposed recovery actions that may have the potential to affect historic properties or sites of religious or cultural significance in the Hawaiian archipelago. These properties or sites may include fish ponds and associated structures, fishing shrines, and fishing ko&lsquo;as, among others. In addition to potential impacts to properties or sites, other cultural resources and traditional practices may also be affected by the actions proposed in the PEIS. This project is focused on identifying Native Hawaiians' concerns regarding potential impacts of NMFS' Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions on historic properties of religious and cultural significance to Native Hawaiians, as well as on their cultural resources and traditional practices.<br />The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the effects of their actions on the human environment. This assessment must consider whether the proposed actions may significantly affect historic and cultural resources. The Code of Federal Regulations in 40 CFR 1508.8(b) describes what is to be included when assessing the effects of federal actions: "Effects includes ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative." Furthermore, the regulations state that "Significantly as used in NEPA requires considerations of both context and intensity" (40 CFR 1508.27), and that the following factors (among others) should be considered in evaluating intensity:<br />&bull; Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(3)). <br />&bull; The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(8)).<br />Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 U.S.C. Section 470f) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties, specifically properties that are listed and/or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Furthermore, Section 101(d)(6)(B) of the Act requires that federal agencies must consult with any NHO that attaches religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by the agency's undertakings. The project associated with this statement of work will assist NMFS in meeting NMFS' obligations under Section 106 of the NHPA by consulting with Native Hawaiians and other relevant parties (e.g., non-Hawaiian fishpond owners) to ensure the impacts of Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions on historic properties, cultural resources, and traditional practices are thoroughly identified, understood, assessed, and mitigated to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>2. Scope and Objectives</p>
<p>The work requires an individual or organization with proven talent, expertise, and capability to provide a thorough assessment of the impacts of implementing recovery actions detailed in the Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Actions PEIS on Native Hawaiian cultural resources, historic properties, and traditional practices. The work also requires an individual or organization with proven expertise in the NHPA Section 106 compliance process, capable of working directly with NMFS, NHO's, the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and other appropriate parties to identify historic properties that meet the criteria for placement on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>The objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist NMFS in complying with NHPA Section 106, including the consultation requirements with NHO's and other eligible parties (e.g., Non-Hawaiian fishpond owners) by:<br />o Identifying and contacting those organizations and parties.<br />o Working with the NHO's and other parties to identify historic properties of religious and cultural significance that may be affected by the actions detailed in the PEIS, determine whether these properties are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.<br />o Identify any potential adverse effects that may occur to these identified historic properties.<br />o Develop acceptable measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the identified potential adverse effects.<br />o Develop a Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Programmatic Agreement (PA) outlining how potential adverse effects will be addressed.<br />o Coordinate communication and consultation with the Hawaii SHPD and the ACHP at appropriate junctures in the compliance process.<br />&bull; Revise the current Cultural Impact Assessment (CIA) in the PEIS by thoroughly assessing and describing in detail the impacts of the proposed actions described in the PEIS on Native Hawaiian cultural resources, historic properties, and traditional practices in accordance with NEPA.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, PRD requires a Contractor who is widely recognized as having expertise in Native Hawaiian cultural resources and traditional practices, and who can effectively facilitate communications among and between Native Hawaiian organizations and individuals, other engaged parties, and NMFS staff. The scope of work includes clearly understanding, accurately documenting, and effectively communicating concerns and priorities of NMFS and Native Hawaiians regarding endangered Hawaiian monk seal recovery; planning, facilitating, and documenting meetings and individual consultations to identify historic properties of religious and cultural significance, cultural resources, and traditional practices that may be affected by Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions; and working with Native Hawaiians to identify measures that may avoid, minimize, or mitigate these potential impacts. The results and products delivered via this contract will be used by NMFS to assess and mitigate the impacts of Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions on Native Hawaiian cultural resources, historic properties, and traditional practices; and to meet the agency's obligations under NHPA section 106 and NEPA.</p>
<p>Regarding the scope and scale of this project, the recovery actions presented in the PEIS are programmatic in nature, meaning, in part, that the exact times and locations at which some of the actions will be implemented will vary depending on conditions in the field that may change over time.</p>
<p>The approach adopted by the Contractor in implementing this project will need to reflect the programmatic nature of the proposed actions in the PEIS discussed above. The Contractor shall be expected to develop and implement an approach and process that represents a reasonable and good faith effort, while doing so in a timely manner and at a cost and level of effort that is proportional to the overall cost and level of effort of implementing the actions presented in the PEIS.</p>
<p>3. Tasks</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1. Prepare and submit a project implementation plan</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare and submit for NMFS review and acceptance a written project implementation plan describing the overall approach and specific steps the Contractor shall take to successfully complete the project, including completion of Tasks 2 - 5 below. The plan will describe the approach to be adopted by the Contractor in identifying and mitigating potential adverse effects as discussed above in Section 2. The plan will include, sections describing the overall project approach, objectives, milestones, timeline(s), and draft outlines for the revised PEIS cultural impact assessment section (Task 3) and the NHPA Section 196 compliance report (Task 4). The plan will be subject to PRD review and approval prior to plan implementation by the Contractor.</p>
<p>Task 2. Conduct consultations with NHO's and Hawaiian individuals, other eligible parties, and NMFS staff.</p>
<p>Per the project implementation plan prepared and submitted in Task 1., the Contractor shall plan, convene, and facilitate meetings among Native Hawaiians and other eligible parties (e.g., non-Hawaiian fishpond owners) and between these parties and NMFS staff engaged in planning Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions. Meeting participants shall include NHO's, community leaders, and cultural practitioners, identified by the Contractor and reviewed by PRD, who have extensive experience with, knowledge of, and/or strong cultural ties to Hawai&lsquo;i's cultural resources, traditional and/or religious practices, and/or marine resources.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall hold at least one meeting during the performance period between the consulting parties and NMFS PRD staff on each of the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. The objectives of these meetings are to 1) identify historic properties, cultural resources, and religious and/or traditional practices that may be affected by the actions proposed in the PEIS; 2) identify potential adverse effects that may occur to these properties, resources, and/or practices; and 3) develop acceptable mitigation measures to avoid, offset, or minimize the potential adverse effects to the identified properties, resources, and/or practices.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall also:<br />&bull; Prepare and submit for PRD review and acceptance written plans and discussion topics for each meeting at least one week prior to each meeting;<br />&bull; Provide for PRD review and acceptance written reports within four weeks after each meeting summarizing the results of the meetings, including information pertinent to Tasks 3 and 4 below; and,<br />&bull; Disburse and administer expenditures associated with the meetings, including all expenditures associated with pre and post meeting communications, meeting venues and supplies, cultural protocols, and travel for participants who are not NMFS staff or contractors.</p>

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>National Marine Sanctuaries were authorized by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. Through this act, the Secretary of Commerce can designate an area with significant cultural or biological resources as a Marine Sanctuary and provide these areas and their resources with special protection. Marine Sanctuaries are administered by the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The goal of the National Marine Sanctuary System is to protect and manage these marine resources through research, education, conservation and stewardship. The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS), one of 13 national marine sanctuaries seeks non-personal services to perform the tasks and duties of resource protection.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Q: Malpractice insurance was not a requisite for the previous PDHRA contract and did not appear anywhere in the PWS. Medical personnel are covered under the military/Air Force malpractice so I am wondering if this requirement is accurate.</p>
<p>A: Medical personnel are covered under military/Air Force malpractice. Please see revised PWS where this requirement has been removed.</p>
<p>Q: The quantity for the amount of hours for the base year and option year is listed at 2008 hours the base is closed for 10 observed holidays a year which equals 80 hours. There are only 2080 hours in a year so 2008 does not include all holidays. Also previous PDHRA contract and all contracts that I have seen have 1880 as the quantity for hours ( 10 holidays x 8 hours= 80hrs), ( 3 wks unpaid leave= 120hrs), 2080 hrs - 200hrs = 1880 hrs/year.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI is for informational planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a promise of a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations.
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement.

Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining information about various IR-variable inks with potential application as machine-readable features on future generations of U. S. currency. An IR-variable ink is defined as an ink wherein its respective absorption/reflection spectrum in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum contains spectral features - in contrast to one having a relatively flat spectral response - but is not limited to any particular visual color. Proposed IR-variable inks should be novel but may be based on commercially available materials. The inks may have other characteristics not related to its NIR spectral response such as magnetic properties, fluorescence, etc. In fact, any additional effects will be considered a plus for any given ink. An effective IR-variable ink should be:</p>
<p>A. one with an absorption/reflection spectrum in the NIR that is not flat<br />B. useful for printing methods used in security printing, e.g., intaglio, offset, letterpress, screen and others <br />C. readable by a discriminating standalone detection system<br />D. resistant to simulation or duplication, both in terms of material and spectral response</p>
<p>The responses are limited to 10 pages in Microsoft windows compatible software. Responses to contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. the name of the ink and its visual color<br />2. its respective absorption/reflection spectrum ranging from, at minimum, 400 - 1700 nm<br />3. a description of the measurement methodology for #2<br />4. any further information about the characteristics of the ink and other additives which may be used with the ink<br />5. a brief summary of the security of the ink relative to simulation and duplication and why, and<br />6. any number of responses of ink examples may be submitted <br />7. Company name, point of contact, web site, email, and telephone number<br />8. Business size classification<br />9. DUNS number</p>
<p>No actual ink materials or chemicals are requested at this time. The submitted responses will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature. Future assessments may include compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, health and safety and other processing requirements.</p>
<p><br />The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted.</p>
<p>All response to this RFI shall be directed to Kathleen Reidy, Contract Specialist, via windows compatible email attachments to Kathleen.Reidy@bep.gov or via hard copy to</p>

Please monitor this website for the complete solicitation, then submit a offer if you meet the requirements. </span></p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><br />In 2012, to increase examiner production hours, OCC determined that it needed to reduce the effort by examiners to assess and score the written communications skills test (WCST) and ensure that any candidate that does not pass the written test, or any of the up-front assessment tools, do not move further in the assessment process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To do so, it was determined that using "computer technology" to automate the scoring the WCST would ensure unbiased consistent results and not require the use of examiners for assessments - in effect obtaining better results using fewer key resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The WCST will be administered separately by OCC's testing administrator at their sites and is preceded by OCC's knowledge test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two campaigns may be run each year and OCC estimates that upward of 2,000 assessments may be required for each campaign.</span></p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>The OCC is seeking an experience and qualified vendor (s) to&nbsp;automate the assessment scoring of the existing WCST and implement and test the automated assessment scoring technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><strong>&nbsp; <br /><br /></strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />The OCC plans to issue a solicitation and subsequent award with a base year and four one-year option periods.</span></p>

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to gain knowledge of potentially interested and qualified sources. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Information should focus on the capability to provide the technical support services defined below. Standard company brochures are not desired.<br />The United States Air Force seeks to procure contractor support to provide IT services to support approximately 200 users. The software used by the United States Air Force is significantly more sophisticated than typical office automation: including specialized operations research models, mathematical optimization, and other general tools associated with operations research. The computational heart of the organization is located in a SCIF with specialized analytic architectures that combine UNIX (Solaris, IRIX, and/or LINUX) with Windows in stand-alone networks. These architectures are selectively combined and modified in some instances to run on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) with AF Enterprise office automation applications. The architecture is further abstracted into another subset that runs on the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), which, while centrally managed under a separate contract by another organization, will require first-tier Client Support Technician (CST) troubleshooting and remediation support from this contract.<br />A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is available below. To evaluate the potential number of vendors capable of adequately performing under the United States Air Force PWS, a thorough review of capability statements will be conducted. Interested parties who believe they have the ability to provide the required services are invited to supply a capabilities statement of no more than twenty (20) pages. Capability statements must include: <br />1. Complete Business Name, including DUNS Number <br />2. Contact Information (Respondent's name and title, address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail) <br />3. Business Size and Classification (small, small-disadvantaged, SBA Certified 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled, veteran-owned etc). <br />Capability statements must address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to the key task areas detailed in the draft PWS.<br />The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods. The Government intends to issue the solicitation in May 2012 after a pre-solicitation notice is published as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2. The procurement strategy will be determined in part by the responses to this notice. <br />All interested parties believing they can provide the required services as defined in the United States Air Force PWS are invited to submit the above documentation; however, it is anticipated that this requirement will be open only to SDVSOB&nbsp;. Responses should be e-mailed to Contract Specialist via the e-mail link below.
<p>ALL INFORMATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN 2:00 PM EDT WEDNESDAY, MARCH 23, 2012.

<DESC>Performance-Based Seismic Design (PBSD)<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT IS A STANDARD FORM (SP) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. <br /><br />This is a request a submission of a Standard Form 330 in accordance with the FAR Subpart 36.6. This announcement constitutes a notice of intent to contract Architect and Engineer Services. Submission to this notice of intent is not considered a proposal. <br /><br />Solicitation Number: HSFE60-12-R-0037<br />Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Services. <br />NAICS Code: 541330
<p>1. Background information<br />Performance-Based Seismic Design (PBSD) is a concept that permits the design and construction of buildings with a realistic and reliable understanding of the risk of life, occupancy and economic loss that may occur as a result of future earthquakes or other significant loading events. PBSD is based on an evaluation of a building's design to determine the probability of experiencing different types of losses, considering the range of potential earthquake events that may affect the facility. The desired performance level for a structure, along with a specified level of seismic shaking, are defined at the initiation of the structure's design process. The decision-maker then selects one or more of these performance levels, and an input ground motion event or hazard level for which this performance is to be achieved. The designer would then utilize a PBSD assessment procedure that is intended to allow for the determination as to whether these various performance levels are met or exceeded for the selected design hazard. Following the PBSD process, the building design would then be adjusted until the performance assessments indicate a risk of loss that is deemed acceptable by the building owner or regulator.<br /><br />The PBSD process may be used by the owner or their design team to:<br />&bull; Design individual critical facilities that are more loss-resistant than typical buildings designed using prescriptive criteria;<br />&bull; Design individual critical facilities with a higher confidence that they will actually be able to perform as intended after, or even during, a design event;<br />&bull; Design individual facilities that are capable of meeting the performance intent of the prescriptive criteria, but at lower construction cost than would be possible using the prescriptive criteria;<br />&bull; Investigate the performance of typical structures designed using the prescriptive provisions of the building code and develop judgments as to the adequacy of this performance; or<br />&bull; Formulate possible improvements to the prescriptive provisions contained in the building code so that more consistent and reliable performance is attained by buildings using these provisions</p>
<p>FEMA contracted with the Applied Technology Council (ATC) to initiate the Phase 1: Development of a Seismic Performance Assessment Methodology. Phase 1, which will be completed in Fiscal Year 2012, will result in the publication of Guidelines for Performance Assessment (FEMA P-58-1). These Performance Assessment Guidelines could be used directly to evaluate the performance of new and existing structures, by applying standard methods of structural analysis, coupled with structural reliability/loss estimation methods.</p>
<p>The project plan of action was originally developed by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) and published by FEMA in April 2000 as Action Plan for Performance-Based Seismic Design (FEMA-349). The FEMA-349 plan extended over an implementation period of ten years and required funding in amounts ranging from $20 to $27 million (1998 dollars). The FEMA-349 Action Plan for Performance-Based Seismic Design defined six products essential to the creation and implementation of comprehensive, acceptable Performance-Based Seismic Design Guidelines:<br /><br />Phase 1:<br />i. A Program Management Plan that incorporates a broadly based oversight group (the Steering Committee) to shepherd and promote the development of the Guidelines (over an extended period of time, say up to 10 years), and an education and implementation strategy to facilitate the use of the Guidelines. <br />ii. Structural Performance Products that quantify performance levels, specify how to evaluate a building's performance capability for a specified level of seismic hazard and with a defined reliability or level of confidence, and provide guidance on how to design a structure to meet a given performance level for a specified level of seismic hazard (with defined reliability).<br />iii. Nonstructural Performance Products that provide engineers with the capability to evaluate and design nonstructural components, such as partitions, piping, HVAC equipment (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), with the goal of ensuring that such components will meet a specified level of performance for a specified level of seismic hazard (with defined reliability). <br />iv. Risk Management Products that provide methodologies for calculating the benefits of designing to various performance objectives and to make rational economic choices about the levels of performance desired, the levels of confidence desired, and the comparative costs to reach those levels.<br /><br />Phase 2:<br />v. Performance-Based Seismic Design Guidelines that provide methodology and criteria for design professionals, material suppliers, and equipment manufacturers to implement performance-based design.<br />vi. A Stakeholders Guide that explains performance-based seismic design to non-technical audiences, including building owners, managers, and lending institutions. <br /><br /><br />2. Scope of Work<br />Please refer to the DRAFT Statement of Work attached to this notice.</p>
<p>3. Location<br />The primary place of performance will either be the Contractor's facilities or at another location involving the least cost to the specific Task Order. It is anticipated that most of the work will be performed on the west coast, where most of the country's earthquake expertise resides, with very few visits to FEMA required.</p>
<p>4. Contract Information<br />FEMA will utilize the procedures in FAR Subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services, to conduct this acquisition. <br /><br />The resulting contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), with five (5) ordering periods covering a total of 60 months from the date of award. (A twelve (12) month Base Period and 4 twelve (12) month option periods). The minimum value of this contract will be $50,000. <br /><br />Firms will be evaluated, rated and ranked, by the A-E Evaluation Board. A maximum of five (5) most qualified firms will be invited to partake in discussions with the Evaluation Board and will again be rated. A most preferred firm will be selected.<br /><br />The most preferred firm shall be invited to submit a Technical and a Business Proposal in response to a Request for Proposal.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED WITH THIS NOTICE.<br /><br /><br />5.

<p>Project Services:<br />The support services required are listed below :</p>
<p>1. Administration &amp; Management<br />2. Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Obstetrics<br />3. Prenatal Clinic/Prenatal Diagnostic Center Neonatology and Developmental Follow-Up, Fetal and Neonatal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study fetal and neonatal anatomy and function<br />4. Informatics (including Data Collection, Database Management, Perinatal Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Computational Biology)<br />5. Placental and Perinatal Pathology<br />6. Laboratory Support (parturition, biomarker discovery and validation, microbiology, reproductive immunology, perinatal neurobiology, management of a repository of biological samples)<br />7. Molecular Evolution of Reproduction (focused on placentation and parturition)</p>
<p>Project Mandatory Qualifications:<br />Offerors must meet all the Mandatory Qualification Criteria set forth below at the time of initial proposal submission in order for their proposal(s) to be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>1. Availability to required patient population. <br />The goal of the PRB/PPRO is to study pregnancy complications leading to the excessive rate of infant morbidity and mortality. The frequency of individual pregnancy complications is low, ranging from 1 to 6% of births (i.e., preterm delivery &lt;32 weeks, severe preeclampsia, congenital anomalies, severe small for gestational age). Consequently, access to a large obstetric population is required to efficiently recruit patients during pregnancy, obtain adequate neonatal outcome and infant follow-up information on a scientifically valid number of patients within a defined period of time. Therefore, offerors must provide evidence that they have an obstetrical population delivering a minimum of 4,500 deliveries at a "single site".</p>
<p>A "single site" is defined as one hospital with one labor and delivery suite, and not a "system", "consortium" or "group" of affiliated hospitals. This requirement is paramount to maintain efficacy of this federally funded program. Since a patient can deliver any time during a 24 hour period, it is more cost-efficient to house the program at a single site. This will avoid the need to replicate and maintain a research infrastructure (space, equipment, faculty, nursing staff and laboratory personnel) in more than one hospital. This approach will also simplify the management of the research operation.</p>
<p>Institutions with two labor and delivery suites located in different hospitals under the same name do not meet the requirement of a "single site" if neither of the units has a minimum of 4,500 deliveries per year. The conditions of stability of the patient population and access to patients defined elsewhere must be met at the time of the submission of the offer, negotiations and contract administration.</p>
<p>NICHD wishes to avoid housing this Branch in an institution with a rapidly shifting patient population away from the site that will house the Branch. Buildings that house Branch personnel or Contract personnel in support of the Branch or to which Branch and Contract personnel will need to go to accomplish their goals, shall be located within a mile of the building which houses the labor delivery unit and the Administrative Offices of the Branch.</p>
<p>2. Approved residency programs in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics and Pathology. <br />The execution of clinical research in obstetrics and perinatology is a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week effort as labor and delivery of complicated pregnancies can rarely be scheduled. Residency programs in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics and Pathology assure around the clock staffing of basic services required to conduct clinical research. The existence of approved programs in these disciplines is also an indicator of the commitment of the institutions to a training mission, which is also an important goal of the Branch.</p>
<p>3. Board approved fellowships in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Neonatology, Reproductive Endocrinology, Human Genetics, and Pediatric Cardiology. <br />An important goal of the PRB/PPRO is to train sub-specialists in disciplines related to perinatal medicine. This training must qualify Fellows for sub-specialty certification by the appropriate Division of the American Boards. The existence of already approved fellowship programs in these areas will obviate the need for a new application and will expedite accomplishment of the Branch's training goal. It is expected that existing programs will be expanded or modified to accommodate the needs of the Branch. If expansion is not possible, then it is required that priority will be given to clinical Fellows appointed by the PRB/PPRO. In order to justify expansion of the program and obtain Board approval, institutions must have an adequate case load and training opportunities. The presence of approved fellowship programs in Maternal Fetal Medicine, Human Genetics, Neonatalogy, Reproductive Endocrinology and Pediatric Cardiology is generally considered evidence that an academic culture fostering training and research exists at the hosting institution. Training and research programs in Reproductive Endocrinology and Human Genetics are important because the PRB/PPRO is interested in studying complications of the first trimester of pregnancy, genetic diagnosis, fetal dysmorphology, prenatal diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases including anatomic anomalies and inborn errors of metabolism. The Branch will also focus on improving the prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease and fetal cardiovascular dysfunction, which may underlie the increased risk of growth-restricted fetuses for coronary artery disease, stroke and hypertension in adult life.</p>
<p><strong>It is anticipated that one-cost reimbursement-term, incrementally funded, type of contract will be awarded, for a period of performance of 10 years, beginning on or about November 1, 2012. The RFP will be posted on or about June 27, 2012 on the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the synopsis is to revise the anticipated release of the solicitation to July 2012 and to correct the total anticipated quantity. The sunopsis is re-stated below:

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the production of up to 1,000,000 Battlefield Dosimeters.  The current Navy Battlefield Dosimeter is the IM-270/PD. The IM-270/PD is a battery-powered, self- indicating device.  The shelf life of the IM-270/PD is nearing its end, due to the battery life. For this reason and in support of the next Battlefield Dosimeter, BUMED, through the Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC), has requested NAVSEA 04RN to commence the procurement of a Battlefield Dosimetry system that would meet the requirements for a Battlefield Dosimeter and also function as a dosimeter for Operations Other than War (OOTW).
  The intended period of performance is from the date of award through four (4) years thereafter.  The detailed requirements will be provided in the solicitation to be issued in July 2012.

Requisite amendments forthcoming.  Update 2: Bidders' questions submisstion window extended from 23 May 2012 to 11 June 2012 at 1700.  Please submit in accordance with orginal submission guidance prescribed below.  Update 1: See Amendment 0001 & Related Attachments - 06/01/2012  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) on behalf of the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office (PMW 205) has issued Request for Proposal (RFP) number N00039-12-R-0009 for the procurement of the Next Generation Enterprise Network's Transport and Enterprise Services requirements. The Department of the Navy (DON) operates one of the largest intranets in the world, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI).  NMCI provides end-to-end secure Information Technology (IT) services to more than 400,000 seats and 800,000 users, across 2,500+ USN and USMC locations that vary from major bases to single user locations.   NMCI has been operated under the programmatic and operational oversight of the DON until the end of the contract period of performance, September 30, 2010.  On October 1, 2010, the DON transitioned to the NMCI Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC), for the continued delivery of NMCI services to the DON, through April 30, 2014 (if all options are exercised).  The DON intends to transition IT services from CoSC to the follow-on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract(s). The primary goals of NGEN are to: 1) operate the NMCI network while maintaining delivery of NMCI network and computing services; 2) support the NMCI network and associated computing services from requirement identification to service disposal; 3) ensure continued security of the network and proactive enhancement of information assurance (IA) capabilities to meet evolving and emerging threats; 4) provide Government Command and Control (C2) to ensure flexible and responsive operation and defense of the network; 5) leverage DoD enterprise security services provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to meet user requirements as technically and fiscally feasible and approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA); and 6) maintain continuity of service during transition from NMCI CoSC to follow-on NGEN contract(s) or Government operation. The Government anticipates firm fixed price, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for the Transport and Enterprise Services requirements.  Award will be made to the offeror or combination of offerors that results in the lowest total combined price to the Government for the transition to, and operation and maintenance of the Next Generation Enterprise Network. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with four one-year options.  This is a full and open competition. With the exception of attachments J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J-43, this RFP has been released with all supporting attachments.  Hardcopies of documents will not be provided. Do to the proprietary nature of J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J- 43 these attachments have been posted to the NGEN MITRE Technical Data site located at: https://partners.mitre.org/sites/NEN_TXS_RFP_GOV_TECH_DOC/NGEN_Technical_ DATA/default.aspx MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), is providing a secure server to host the NGEN applicable documents and technical data.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration: <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities.<br /><br />The final FY12 SOF Experimentation focus area will be conducted on 31 Jul-10 Aug 2012 with the theme being Mobility and Vehicle Protection at Camp Roberts, CA.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation focus areas for FY13 tri-annual TNT events are as follows:<br />- 30 Oct - 8 Nov 2012: Urban Operations at Camp Atterbury / Muscatatuck UTC, IN<br />- 26 Feb - 7 Mar 2013: Digital Soldier at Avon Park, FL<br />- 18-27 Jun 2013: Signature Reduction at Camp Roberts, CA</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 75 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts TNT experimentation events in cooperation with NPS at Camp Atterbury / Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Camp Roberts, CA; and at Avon Park, FL. These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. TNT identifies potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater for the purpose of TNT. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 31 Jul-10 Aug 2012, at Camp Roberts, CA. The venue will explore emerging technology solutions for: Mobility and Vehicle Protection. Technology will need to be capable of supporting a SOF unit to provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF small units' vehicle mobility and/or protection. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL-3) or greater. Any and all solutions must provide all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. Mobility and vehicle protection systems may include enhancements to armor, survivability, mobility or C4ISR solutions for new vehicles or existing Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV): Individual - All Terrain Vehicle (ATV); Light - Light Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV); Medium - Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV); Commercial - Non-Standard Commercial Vehicles (NSCV); and Heavy - MRAP RG-31, RG-33, RG 33 AUV and M-ATV. USSOCOM's interest remains all types of vehicular armor, including opaque, flat transparent, curved transparent, and armor for all platforms (ground, rotary wing, fixed wing, and maritime). Flat and curved transparent armor that is lightweight and thin continues to be a high priority. Advanced technologies supporting mobility solutions for amphibious vehicles, silent, hybrid or increased efficiency propulsion are also of interest.</p>
<p>3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation nominations.</p>
<p>4. Respondents interested in live fire experiments shall conduct and submit a safety risk assessment. The risk assessment shall address the likelihood and severity of any inherent risks as well as risk mitigation measures required to bring the resultant risk to a low level. The risk assessment shall be submitted as an attachment to the experiment nomination. Reference MIL-STD-882D for instructions and information regarding risk assessments. Also, respondents are responsible for ammunition shipments to include an Interim Hazard Classification and coordination for receipt and storage at Camp Roberts.</p>
<p>5. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATIONS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATION SUBMITTALS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED WITHIN A 30 DAY SUBMISSION PERIOD DEFINED AS 75-45 DAYS PRIOR TO EACH SPECIFIED TNT EVENT. For the August TNT at Camp Roberts, CA, all submissions must be received no later than&nbsp;22 June 2012. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for FY13 TNT events. Vehicles currently in consideration for the Ground Mobility Vehicle 1.1 Solicitation will not be considered for this experimentation event.</p>
<p>C. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br />Technology Experimentation nominations shall be submitted electronically via USSOCOM webpage: http://1.usa.gov/TNTExpNom. Multiple nominations addressing different technology experiments may be submitted by each respondent. Submissions will be reviewed by USSOCOM personnel, support contractors, or NPS Faculty, Staff, or students. Each technology experiment nomination must address only one experiment.<br />Select respondents will be invited to participate in USSOCOM experiments. USSOCOM shall provide venues, supporting infrastructure, and assessment (operational and technical, based on availability of resources and written request) personnel at no cost to invited respondent(s). Respondent's travel costs and technology experiments will be at the respondent's expense. The TNT venue will only supply basic venue infrastructure including frequency allocation and portable power. Invited respondents should prepare to be self-sufficient during experimentation and not dependent on venue resources for success.<br />D. BASIS FOR SELECTION TO PARTICIPATE:<br />Selection of respondents to participate will be based on the extent to which the technology represents a particular class or level of capability that can be provided to Special Operations Forces. <br />Other considerations include:<br />- Technical maturity<br />- Relevance of or adaptability to military operations/missions<br />- Relevance to current operational needs<br />- Relevant to Event Focus Area<br />E. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: All efforts shall be made to protect proprietary information that is clearly marked in writing. Lessons learned by USSOCOM from these experiments may be broadly disseminated but only within the Government. If selected for participation in TNT experimentation, vendors may be requested to provide additional information that will be used in preparation for the experiments.<br />F. USE OF INFORMATION: The purpose of this notice is to gain information leading to Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities and to assist in accelerating the delivery of these capabilities to the warrior. All proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish future capability and requirements.</p>
<p>G. SPECIAL NOTICE: Respondent's attention is directed to the fact that Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) or contractor consultant/advisors to the Government will review and provide support during evaluation of submittals. When appropriate, non-Government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with procurement Integrity Laws and shall sign non-disclosure and rules of conduct/conflict of interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submission in response to this RFI constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government support contractors.</p>
