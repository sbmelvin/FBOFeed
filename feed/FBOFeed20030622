12. Reference page M-0, Section M.2 entitled “Evaluation Criteria:” Delete this section in its entirety and replace it with the following: 

“M.2 Evaluation Criteria: Technical and cost factors will be evaluated as described herein.
 (a) The criteria below are presented by major category, with relative order of importance, so that offerors will know which areas require emphasis in the preparation of proposals. The criteria below reflect the requirements of this particular solicitation. Offerors should note that these criteria: (1) serve as the standard against which all proposals will be evaluated, and (2) serve to identify the significant matters which offerors should address in their proposals.

(b) Technical Evaluation Criteria: The technical proposal will be scored by a technical evaluation committee using the criteria shown below. 

 (1) Personnel Qualification and Experience (35 Points) a. Technical experience and abilities of proposed team members relative to the scope of work. b. Balance between qualified expatriate and Bosnian senior program staff.  
(2) Past Performance (20 Points) a. Past performance evaluation will focus on such qualities as specific experience in media development work, demonstrated knowledge of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the region, quality of personnel and workmanship standards; b. Quality of prior professional relationships with media counterparts and members of the donor and international communities: c. Quality of home office managerial oversight and quality of home office/field office relationships: d. Demonstrated ability to indigenize programs. 
(3) Proposed Approach to Activity (45 Points) a. Extent to which the proposed approach is consistent with and supports the program aims outlined by the scope of work. b. Degree to which the program is indigenized. c. Quality of management plan, including grants management.

(c)  The Government intends to make an award to at least one responsible and responsive offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Technical, cost and other factors will be evaluated relative to each other, as described herein.  Although cost is not being specifically scored, the award selection will be made on a best value (technical or non-cost versus cost tradeoff) basis, where all non-cost factors will be significantly more important than cost.

 (d) The cost proposal will be analyzed as part of the proposal evaluation process. The cost proposal will be reviewed to determine if the overall costs proposed are realistic for the work to be performed.  Proposed costs may be adjusted, for the purposes of evaluation, based on the results of the cost analysis and its assessment of reasonableness, realism, completeness, and credibility. 

 (e) Prospective offerors are forewarned that a proposal with the lowest estimated cost may not be selected if award to a higher priced proposal affords the Government a greater overall benefit.  Proposals will be rated and ranked on the evaluation factors set forth above.  Estimated cost and price shall receive significantly less consideration than overall technical ability; however, estimated cost is an important factor. 
  
(f) The estimated cost to the Government increases in importance as competing proposals approach equivalence in technical merit and may become the deciding factor where technical proposals are approximately equivalent in merit.”

13.  As stated in Section H.4, Page H-1, the currently authorized AID Geographic Code for the procurement of goods and services is 000 (U.S.) and 168 (Bosnia and Herzegovina). If required, USAID will consider authorizing additional geographic code areas in accordance with its associated waiver and approval process.

14. All references to a “performance based contract” are hereby deleted.  As stated in Sections B.2 and L.3, this is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract. Also delete any references to “the cooperative agreement contractor.”

15. As a point of clarification, all annexes to the solicitation can be found at the Federal Business Opportunities web page together with the original solicitation document, as amended.

16. As a point of clarification, FAR clause 52.219-9 (Small Business Subcontracting Plan) will be contained in the resulting contract. Offerors should familiarize themselves with the requirements of this provision.

All other solicitation terms and conditions remain unchanged.
