<DESC><strong>Acquisition of Print Books for National Library Service for the Blind and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Physically Handicapped, Library of Congress, 2013-2018</strong><br /><br />The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress, intends to establish Blanket Purchase Agreements for a 5-year term with qualified entities for the acquisition of commercially published print books-predominantly adult and juvenile trade hardcover editions of popular fiction and nonfiction-to be used for the production of braille and protected digital audiobooks to be made available to eligible blind, visually impaired, and physically disabled patrons of the free national library service. Under a special exemption of the U.S. copyright law, NLS annually selects, purchases, and produces (using federal funds) approximately 2,000 unabridged audiobooks and 500 braille books. The NLS Union Catalog provides access to more than 200,000 titles in alternate formats, most of them produced by NLS and its affiliated network libraries. Anticipated reader demand determines the number of copies produced for any title. Once a title has been created, proprietary digital cartridges are mass produced under contract and distributed to 111 regional and subregional libraries across the United States. NLS also makes more than 50,000 audio and electronic braille publications available for download on its protected website, BARD. Vendors will provide print books in multiple copies (2 or 4) to NLS on an as-needed basis during the period of performance. Typically, 60-70 orders are placed annually. Books are selected by professional staff of the NLS Collection Development Section and assigned for production in audio and braille formats to contractors.
<p>NLS intends to establish multiple agreements with separate organizations for the acquisition of hard-to-find and out-of-print titles. The approximate date of release of the RFP is March 5th, 2013, and the approximate date of award is May 2013.</p>
<p>Offerors will also be asked to submit technical and cost proposals in response to the following requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong><br />1. Must be able to supply requested books in a consistent and timely manner. <br /><br />2. Must use common carrier (e.g., UPS, FedEx) rather than the U.S. Postal Service (NLS cannot dependably receive USPS mail).<br /><br />3. Must have a reliable customer service capability and provide live personal response to queries and problems.<br /><br />4. Must offer an extensive inventory of current in-print trade books published in the United States and/or an extensive inventory of out-of-print and hard-to-find trade books published in the United States. NLS must acquire both current and out-of-print titles as well as books in Spanish published in the U.S. <br /><br />5. Must offer reasonable prices for used and OP books and substantial discounts on most in-print titles (40-45%). <br /><br />6. Must perform at an extremely high level of reliability with speedy responses to requests for assistance or clarification.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement Components and Incumbents:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Component/Contract	Incumbents</strong><br /><br />(1)	Supply current in-print trade books: a) Baker &amp; Taylor b) Ingram Library Services</p>
<p>(2)	 Supply hard-to-find/out-of-print books: Alibris&nbsp;</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Deep Canyon Culvert removal project consists of removing a 72" CMP from Canyon Creek. The roadwidth ranges from 24 feet to 35 feet wide with large fills. The road shall be decommissionned by recontouring as described in worklist. All fill material in draw will be removed and stream channel restored to natural grade and dimensions. This will require hauling excessive material away to approved waste sites. The waste sites require some preparatory work with post haul shaping and cleaning. All disturbed areas will be seeded on recontoured roadbed and waste sites. In addition, native forbs and shrubs will be transplanted from areas adjacent to the recontroured roadbed. Grade control structures will be constructed in newly reconstructed stream channel.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for Balloon Flight Program Operations services.  These services include operating and maintaining the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF), and providing engineering services to support the NASA Balloon Program. CSBF is a Government-owned facility located in Palestine, Texas, with a permanent balloon staging facility at Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The Contractor will also be required to provide operational balloon flight support including launching, tracking, and recovering scientific balloons and payloads, and to provide engineering services for operational support, quality control, and balloon research and development.  Contract services will be performed at multiple locations including at the CSBF, at Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) located at Wallops Island VA, and at the Contractor's facility. To allow the short term continuation of the existing Balloon Flight Program Operations contract (from April 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, with up to seven one-month options through January 31, 2015) until a follow-on competitive procurement is completed, NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from the current incumbent, Regents of New Mexico State University, Physical Science Laboratory, on a sole source basis.  Conducting a competitive procurement for the continuation of these services would seriously impact current ongoing balloon flight program activities and the efficiency of the follow-on competition.  For those offerors that are interested in participating in the follow-on competition for these services, we currently anticipate the release of a draft RFP in the March time frame. Authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only one responsible source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A Request for Proposal is not available. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
<p>The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) has historically utilized the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' services for their hospital accreditations. IHS OIT has significant time and money invested into the development of data marts and transmission standards to support use of the JCAHO for hospital accreditation services. The JCAHO transmission standards are (as are all accreditation vendors) a proprietary design; consequently, any alternative application would require significant re-development and cost to the government in order to transition. Based on this, IHS intends to pursue this sole source acquisition. However, any vendor believing that they can provide the product/service listed above may submit a written email response to Michelle Kouis (Contract Specialist) at michelle.kouis@ihs.gov no later than February 22, 2014 (5 pm Eastern).</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION:<br /><br /></span></strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />This is a pre-solicitation / notice of intent synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive award&nbsp;to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975&nbsp;
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>The following Reagents for this Requirement</strong>:</p>
<p>1. TruSeq Custom Oligo Set, Catalog Number: FC-121-0200, Units: 1, 152 Samples.<br />2. Shipping and Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>:<br /><br />Delivery will be within 6-8 weeks of receiving approved purchase order.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</span></strong></p>
<p>While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. When an investigator wishes to study only selected genes or genomic regions it is more cost-effective and efficient to perform targeted sequencing. The goal is to discover as many variants linked to fanco anemia as possible. The investigator has a collection of many hundreds of samples, so the system must be compatible with large sample numbers. TruSeq Custom Enrichment is an in-solution capture assay for targeting and enriching user-selected human genomic regions of ~500 kb - 25 Mb of cumulative DNA per sample for fully-customized re-sequencing. The assay is ideal for targeting specific genomic content, such as variant validation, examination of specific genes in pathways, or as a follow-up to GWAS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY</span></strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</span></strong></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-65 (January 29, 2013).</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a sole source on competitive basis for TruSeq Custom Oligo Set to Illumina, Inc. is based upon the responses to the sources sought synopsis published in the FedBizOpps on [HHS-NIH-NHLBI-CSB-2013-0086-DLM, February 5, 2013, TruSeq Custom Oligo Set]. Any information received as a result of this pre-solicitation / notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurements. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. If you have any questions, please submit to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent Naval Air Station, Patuxent River MD, 20670, intends to conduct a competition in accordance with FAR 6.102(b) to procure AIM-9M Rocket Motors, Mk 36 Mod 11 and Mk 36 Mod 13, (NSN 1337-01-145-1963 and NSN 1337-01-484-7681), under a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The contract will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and will contain a 12-month base period and (4) 12-month options. The minimum/maximum quantities for the contract are 320/4,000. Delivery will be required to begin within 18 months from the date of contract award.
<p>The rocket motors are approximately 71 inches long, 5 inches in diameter, and consist of a reduced smoke propellant cast into a steel tube, three hanger attachment lugs, igniter, mechanical arming handle, and nozzle. The process of building the Mk 36 Rocket Motor includes casting a solid propellant inside the motor case. Performance of this contract requires the capability to process, store, and test large quantities of high explosives, and have a proper facility with established safety procedures conforming to the requirements of Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Operating Procedures Document "OP-5, Volume 1, Ammunition And Explosives Safety Ashore". The contract will also require radiographic (X-ray) inspection of ordnance items, and demilitarization capability. In addition, the contract will require compliance with the requirements of the DoD Contractors' Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives, DoD 4145.26-M.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort will require compliance with the Technical Data Package (TDP) requirements, including a First Article Test (FAT), a Lot Acceptance Test (LAT), and production acceptance tests and inspections. The TDP for the Mk 36 Rocket Motor is classified CONFIDENTIAL. Due to the classified nature of the TDP, all offerors will be required to comply with all applicable Defense Security Service provisions of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M), including obtaining Facility Security Clearance to the CONFIDENTIAL level. The TDP will be made available only after the draft Solicitation is released. In order to receive the TDP, potential offerors must have a Facility Security Clearance to receive and store classified information up to CONFIDENTIAL. This clearance must be in place before the formal Solicitation is released, in order to receive the TDP in time to prepare a proposal. The USG will not sponsor any potential offeror in their attempt to obtain this clearance. For additional information on obtaining security clearances, please refer to National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) DoD 5220.22-M, Chapter 2-Security Clearances, Section 1. Facility Clearances.</p>
<p>The NAVAIR Designated Disclosure Authority has determined that the TDP exceeds the "Offshore Procurement" provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) 22 C.F.R Chapter 1, Subchapter M, Section 124.13. Numerous other US regulations and DoD policies support this determination as well. As a result of this determination, the TDP will not be released to non-U.S. companies.</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to award one contract to the offeror who provides the best overall value. There is no commitment by NAVAIR to issue a solicitation, make an award, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for this effort.</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to host a pre-solicitation conference in the September 2013 timeframe, after release of the draft solicitation. When the date, time and location of the conference is determined, that information will be posted in an amendment to this announcement. NAVAIR intends to release the draft solicitation, including Sections L &amp; M, in the September 2013 timeframe, followed by a formal solicitation in the January 2014 timeframe. NAVAIR hopes to award the contract on or about 25 March 2015. If these timeframes change significantly, an amendment to this announcement will be posted. The draft and formal solicitations will be posted to the NAVAIR homepage at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm and to the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov/. When the formal solicitation is released, all potential sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement may be submitted IN WRITING only to Ms. Nicki LaBriola at Nickiann.Labriola@navy.mil, with a copy to Mr. Gregory S. Lee at gregory.lee@navy.mil. Telephone responses WILL NOT be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a sole-source, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract modification to Honeywell International Inc., Defense and Space Electronics Systems for the Lot 38 full rate production and support of the Advanced Multi-Purpose Displays (AMPD) Performance Specification and the AMPD Interface Control Documents. These AMPDs will support the forward fit into F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft, as well as spares to support sustainment efforts and potential Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirements. The production support element of this procurement will include, but is not limited to, engineering investigations, engineering change proposals, integration and testing, spare repair parts, hardware repairs, software maintenance, engineering and technical support, integrated logistics support, configuration management, and obsolescence management to support production. The contract modification will provide for the procurement of an estimated yearly maximum of one hundred and ninety-six (196) 5X5 displays including spares and forty (40) 8X10 displays including spares. <br /><br />This acquisition is being pursued on a sole-source basis under statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The Government does not possess adequate data and/or the rights to competitively award this requirement. The technical data along with an understanding of the internal functional requirements of the 8X10 AMPD is necessary to retrofit the display without negatively impacting the overall 8X10 performance. For these reasons, only Honeywell support is capable of fulfilling the agency's requirements. The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 334511. <br /><br />While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability to respond to this requirement and may submit information that shall be considered by the Naval Air Systems Command. Inquiries may be directed to Elizabeth Pickering via e-mail at elizabeth.pickering@navy.mil. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Honeywell's Small Business Liaison Officer, Leona Herrera, Honeywell Aerospace, Albuquerque, New Mexico, at 505-828-5183.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY<br />LABORATORY AND FIELD SUPPLIES <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</strong></p>
<p>===========================================================<br /><strong><br />Disclaimer<br /></strong><br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Invitation for Quote (IFQ), or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. Responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract of any nature. The Government will not award a contract based on this RFI. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Responding parties should not anticipate Government feedback on their respective submissions. The Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. All information solicited and received in this RFI will be treated as information only. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.<br />==========================================================<br /><strong><br />PURPOSE<br /></strong><br /><strong>RFI:</strong> This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of gathering data on small businesses with the ability to provide the products and services needed to support EPA's Laboratory and Field Supplies requirements. The overall objective is to get feedback from industry for our initiative to establish an EPA-enterprise approach to sourcing laboratory and field supplies. This approach will include establishing a web-based ordering portal available across all EPA labs and data reporting available at the EPA level. Of particular importance is the supply market's capability to (1) maintain an ordering portal with EPA-specific pricing and (2) meet EPA supplies needs through GSA contracts and/or open market.<br /><br /><strong>Industry Day:</strong> Related to the RFI, a virtual Laboratory and Field Supplies Industry Day was announced on FedBizOpp.Gov on February 11, 2013. Industry Day will be held on February 26, 2013 at 1:00 p.m. See the FedBizOpps Special Notice, "Lab Supplies Industry Day" for details. Interested contractors are encouraged to attend the virtual Industry Day.<br /><strong><br />BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />In response to the OMB's strategic sourcing initiative, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted a spend analysis of its Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 acquisition data and concluded that the "laboratory supplies" commodity area represents an excellent opportunity for strategic sourcing. The EPA spends approximately $7 million annually via purchase card in this commodity area.<br /><br />The agency's key laboratory organizations are the Office of Research and Development, the Programs, and the Regions. There are approximately 40 agency laboratory units across the continental US that serve these organizations. There are a wide variety of mission specific and generic supplies that are routinely acquired.<br /><br />The EPA intends to award one or more single or multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) as a small business set aside. Depending on the results of market research, the BPA(s) may be established with GSA contract holders or non-GSA contractors (open market).<br /><br /><strong>Description of Information Requested<br /></strong><br />The Government requests that you read through this RFI, as well as the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) and its three attachments, and fill in the requested information in the four spreadsheets in the Price Quote Workbook: (1) Contractor Information, (2) Categories, (3) Category Manufacturers, and (4) Specific Products, and the spreadsheet in the Online Ordering Features Workbook.<br /><br />Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Government technical experts drawn from staff within EPA and/or by selected support contractor personnel.

<p>UNIVERSAL SERVICE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPANY (USAC) SEEKS COMMENT ON GOALS AND FEATURES TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE POTENTIAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEMS SUPPORTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES PROGRAM OF THE FEDERAL UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND</p>
<p>Comment Date: March 22, 2013</p>
<p>Reply Comment Date: April 12, 2013</p>
<p>By this notice, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) is seeking comments from interested parties concerning USAC's plans for modernization of information technology (IT) systems supporting the operations of the federal Universal Service Schools and Libraries Support Mechanism (the SLSM, also known as the E-rate Program). This notice does not encompass or seek comments on recommendations for changes to Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) policy or regulations.</p>
<p>USAC is a not-for-profit Delaware corporation. The FCC appointed USAC as the permanent administrator of the Universal Service Support Mechanisms - High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and E-rate (collectively referred to as programs or support mechanisms) - as set forth in Title 47, Part 54, Section 701 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The E-rate Program makes discounts available to eligible schools and libraries for telecommunication services, Internet access, and internal connections. E-rate is intended to provide eligible schools and libraries access to affordable telecommunications and information services.</p>
<p>The current systems supporting the E-rate Program have reached the end of their lifecycle and require extensive modernization to achieve satisfactory reliability and performance goals, provide an improved beneficiary and service provider experience, and have flexibility and scalability to meet future program requirements. USAC is considering make and/or buy solutions to modernize these systems.</p>
<p>USAC seeks comments from E-rate program stakeholders, including IT providers, on goals for the E-rate program IT modernization (SLITM) project and on features to be implemented. These comments will be used to shape USAC's current vision of the characteristics of future E-rate Program operations and the SLITM solution. See the Full Notice for further details at www.usac.org/sl/tools/SLITM/default.aspx.</p>
<p>USAC also seeks comments from E-rate program stakeholders, including IT providers, on a draft statement of work (SOW) and its attachments if USAC issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the SLITM project. These comments will be used to refine the SOW to enhance the achievement of a successful project implementation. The draft SOW is available www.usac.org/sl/tools/SLITM/default.aspx.</p>
<strong>
<p>Request for Comment:</p>
<p>Also visit this web location for information regarding the SL program and the current program operations. Please note that USAC will post all comments we receive, without change, including any personal information you provide. Anyone can find and read the electronic form of all comments received, including the name of the individual sending the comment (or signing the comment for an association, business, labor union, etc.).</p>
</strong>Interested parties may file comments or reply comments electronically on or before the dates indicated above<strong>. </strong>All information submitted including names and addresses will be publicly available via the web at www.usac.org/sl/tools/SLITM/comments.aspx within two business days from submittal. <br /><br /><strong>

<DESC>PURCHASE AND INSTALL PREFABRICATED COMMUNICATIONS SHELTER ON VOLLMER PEAK, CA
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates a microwave communication facility on Vollmer Peak in Contra Costa County, CA.  The USGS uses the site for seismic data collection and distribution as part of the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN).  Currently, the USGS occupies a building built by the U.S. Army sometime before 1940, which is falling into disrepair and is not seismically safe.  The USGS has determined that the cost to repair the current building will be higher than the cost to erect a new building.  Additionally, a new building would also allow the USGS to continue to monitor earthquakes during the construction period with the least amount of downtime.  
The general scope of this project is to purchase and install a 12 x 24, prefabricated communications shelter on a new foundation next to the existing building.  The communications shelter comes as a complete unit:  generator, electrical panels and wiring, coaxial cable attachments, grounding, and more are all included with the building.  The building and all of its components will comply with Department of Interior (DOI) Directive 2009-008, Motorola R-56 standards, and all local, state, and NFPA standards and codes.  All new, modern, and safe electrical systems will be installed, from the main line feeding the building to the backup power systems, lighting, and breaker panels.  The existing communications tower will remain in place; however a new coaxial cable bridge will be required to support the cables between the new building and the tower.   All new site grounding will be installed to bring the site into safety and operational requirements.   New remote monitoring systems will be installed to alert USGS personnel of any adverse conditions at the site.  The existing site fencing will be removed and a new protective fence (chain link) will be installed to contain the new shelter.  An appropriate slab will be poured and a 500 gallon propane tank (to be provided by the USGS) will be installed and connected (through a trench) to the new shelter.  Electrical service to the existing building will be disconnected and the area around the site will be cleared of trees that are starting to become a fire hazard at the site.  Demolition of the existing building is not included in this project, but may happen later as part of a different acquisition.  Communications equipment will be moved from the old shelter into the new shelter, and some relocation and associated rewiring of existing antennas will be required to maintain current functionality.  Full details will be provided in the forthcoming Statement of Work (SOW).
The period of performance will be on the order of 120 days from the notice to proceed (negotiable at the proposal phase,) performance and payment bonds will be required, and the estimated magnitude of this project is between $250K and $500K.  The USGS preliminarily estimates that approximately 60% of the cost of this effort will be for construction activities (preparing the site for the prefabricated shelter and erecting/installing it), 35% of the cost of this effort will be for the purchase of supplies/equipment (25% representing the shelter and 10% representing other supplies/equipment), and 5% of the cost of this effort will be for nonconstruction services.  The Davis-Bacon Act will apply to the construction activities (all construction trades), but neither the Davis-Bacon Act nor the Service Contract Act will apply to the nonconstruction services, which are expected to be professional in nature.  
Contractors must be state of California licensed contractors in good standing, either licensing classification A (General Engineering Contractor) or B (General Building Contractor), at the time proposals are due to be considered for award, and must comply with all applicable California Contractors State License Board requirements, such as but not limited to subcontracting only with licensed specialty-trade (licensing classification C) subcontractors for covered construction work.  The successful contractor will be responsible for obtaining all necessary building permits from Contra Costa County.
The USGS contemplates award of a firm-fixed price contract.  The request for proposals (RFP), including a detailed SOW and contractor evaluation criteria, will be available on or after 11 March 2013.  A site visit opportunity will be provided at a date and time to be determined by the USGS.  Interested parties may contact the Contracting Officer identified below by email to be added to the interest list.
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, 2012) code is 237130, entitled power and communication line and related structures construction.   The associated small business size standard is $33.5M in average (three year moving average) annual revenue.  The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) is Y1BG, for construction of electronic and communications facilities.  This immediate acquisition is set-aside for participation by small business concerns and there is no incumbent contractor.  
Please direct all inquiries to the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, at jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>A. Research Areas of Interest SOF medical personnel place a premium on medical equipment that is small, lightweight, ruggedized, and designed for operation in extreme environments. The equipment must be easy to use, require minimum maintenance, and have low power consumption. Drugs and biologics should not require refrigeration or other special handling. All materiel and related techniques must be simple and effective. Research projects may apply existing scientific and technical knowledge for which concept and/or patient care efficacy have already been demonstrated to meet SOF requirements. 1. Damage Control Resuscitation SOF medical personnel require capabilities for far-forward medical care to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with major battlefield wounds and injuries. The primary emphasis is to research, apply and/or develop medical techniques and materiel (medical devices, drugs, and biologics) for early intervention in life-threatening battle injuries when MEDEVAC is not possible. The four project areas under  quote mark Damage Control Resuscitation quote mark  to which SOF will give highest consideration are: a. Global Treatment Strategies. The proposed project must research, apply and/or develop effective treatment strategies that address the following elements: hypotensive resuscitation, optimal fluid(s), uncomplicated shock, non-compressible hemorrhaging and traumatic brain injuries. These strategies must be optimized for patients in austere, far-forward areas who must be treated for extended periods (days, not hours). b. Vital Signs Monitoring. The proposed project must research, apply and/or develop novel concepts for miniaturized and ruggedized vital signs monitors (temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, capnography, and pulse oximetry) that capture data for later retrieval. Concepts should include an open architecture to allow for easier integration with other systems and applications. c. Analgesia. The proposed project must research, apply and/or develop novel analgesia that provide broad toxicity spectrum, easy administration in <br> the field, tolerance of extreme environments, and effectiveness at the point of injury for a prolonged period of field care (days, not hours) and does not sensitize the patient to topical analgesia. Maximum analgesia with minimal sedation is preferred. d. Far Forward Blood. The proposed project must research novel strategies to increase the ease, efficacy, and safety of blood transfusion (i.e. person to person, pre-hospital blood banking) forward of normal logistics support; e.g., evaluating blood for type/cross matching and for the presence of pathogens. 2. Environment-Specific Medicine SOF personnel must often operate for extended periods of time in environments that expose them to extremes in altitude, temperature, humidity, wind, etc. In addition, the environment may be compromised due to chemical, biological, and radiological contamination. The primary emphasis of this research area is to research, apply and develop techniques and materiel (medical devices, drugs, and biologics) to ensure sustained human performance and effectiveness while operating in harsh environmental conditions and/or wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. The three project areas under  quote mark Environment-Specific Medicine quote mark  to which SOF will give highest consideration are: a. Optimal Acclimatization Strategy. The proposed project must research, apply and/or develop novel approaches that provide rapid and sustainable human acclimatization for extremes in temperature, altitude and time change (circadian acclimatization). b. High Altitude Pulmonary Edema/High Altitude Cerebral Edema. The <br> proposed project must research, apply and/or develop novel treatment approaches, either pharmaceutical interventions or alternative treatments, for high altitude pulmonary edema and /or high altitude cerebral edema. c. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) Rapid Diagnostics. The proposed project must research and apply and/or develop novel approaches that will diagnose human exposure to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosives in near real time. 3. Force Protection a. SOF personnel must be protected from extreme environments. The specific sub-area of interest under  quote mark Force Health Protection quote mark  is rapid field diagnostics for infectious diseases, toxic industrial compounds, and/or toxic industrial materials. 4. Canine Medicine SOF personnel rely on the capabilities of their canines. The primary emphasis of this research area is to explore alternatives and/or new approaches to sustain and enhance SOF canine performance in combat. SOF medical personnel place a premium on canine-specific approaches that are effective in extreme environments and do not require significant logistical support (i.e. maximize use of current SOF medic materiel). The six project areas under  quote mark Canine Medicine quote mark  to which SOF will give highest consideration are: a. Environmental Extremes. Research to develop novel approaches/treatment concepts for SOF canines that address optimal acclimatization strategies, saltwater toxicity, and/or exposure to hot and cold extremes. Proposals may address pharmaceutical interventions and alternative treatments for High Altitude Pulmonary Edema/High Altitude Cerebral Edema. b. Sensory Optimization and <br> Protection. Research to develop novel approaches/treatments for SOF canines that ensures optimum olfactory and visual performance during combat operations. Research to develop novel approaches/treatment for SOF canines that ensures optimum visual and hearing protection during combat operations. c. Optimal Nutrition and Hydration. Research to develop optimal nutrition and hydration strategies for canines throughout the spectrum of warfare in diverse environments to ensure sustained performance. d. Optimal Anesthesia Protocol. Research to develop optimal anesthesia protocols for the routine and emergency field treatment of canines in diverse environments utilizing available SOF medic analgesic. e. Optimal Trauma Resuscitation Strategy. Research to develop novel approaches/treatments to support optimal trauma resuscitation strategies for canines in diverse environments, especially blast injuries. f. Pre and Post Trauma Training / Behavioral Issues. Research to develop novel approaches/treatment for SOF canines to maintain and restore performance in canines that present behavior and/or post-trauma issues. <br>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.
<p>Background: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources for an Asthma Cohort Support Contract. The proposed research study aims to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma control during pregnancy as well as add knowledge of the basic immunology as it relates to pregnancy. Asthma is a common chronic disease and some women experience exacerbation and worsening of their asthma during pregnancy while others improve. <br />This study is an observational cohort study to evaluate predictors of asthma control variability during pregnancy, including accounting for changes in lung function and markers of inflammation associated with pregnancy in non-asthmatics. Specifically, the study will:</p>
<p>1. Assess whether allergy/atopy status predicts asthma control variability during pregnancy;<br />2. Evaluate whether allergy/atopy status is associated with additional decrements in lung function and increased inflammation in pregnancy among women with asthma after considering the functional role of allergy/atopy among non-asthmatics;<br />3. Evaluate the impact of genetic and immune cell markers (Treg and Foxp3 levels) on asthma control variability during pregnancy; and<br />4. Evaluate changes in lung function and inflammation in all women associated with exposure to poor ambient air quality (traffic, commuting, ambient measures) and low intake of dietary antioxidants.</p>
<p>Responses: Capability statements in response to this announcement should be no longer than 15 pages inclusive of all material.

<a href="mailto:steve.tompkins@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Western New York Healthcare System, VISN 2 Network Contracting Office, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement in accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5 with RGI Informatics, LLC, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This procurement is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) of healthcare analytics software and system with associated supplies and services for all facilities located within VISN 2.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price contract for a VISN-wide Term License and shall include all labor, material, tools, equipment, training, software/software license, and all associated hardware required to furnish and install the healthcare analytics software.  The contractor shall also provide five years of support for the system, which shall include periodic updates to the software, hosting / infrastructure, and professional services (data warehouse maintenance, server & database administration, analytics support, basic user support, and data standardization support).  In conjunction with the healthcare analytics software provided under this contract, VISN 2 intends to install an Anesthesia Record Keeper (ARK) and / or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Clinical Information System (CIS). 

 Executive Summary. VISN 2 is implementing the Department of Veterans Affairs CIS (ICU/ARK) and Analytics program. This program establishes technology infrastructure for the capture, storage and analysis of clinical data during the most critical and data intensive portions of a patient's hospital stay with the goals of improving patient safety and clinical outcomes, conserving heath care resources, and supporting research.  The upcoming solicitation will be for the requirements for the analytics component from the perspective of the intended clinical users.   The data available from electronic medical records contain a wealth of detailed information that is useful for clinical care, traditional and clinical effectiveness research, and the administration of health care - medical analytics must provide the tools needed to access and examine the data. Medical analytics in the critical care areas (intensive care units, the operating and recovery rooms, as well as the emergency department) has great value.  Patients in these areas have the most complex diseases and therapies, variable clinical courses, and morbidity and mortality of all hospital locations. Specialized CIS medical record systems capture and store the vast amount of data recorded on patients while undergoing anesthesia and surgery or while in the intensive care unit.  Together these systems capture and store thousands of records of clinical data for every patient. 

 The Challenge of Medical Analytics. Unprocessed healthcare data are difficult to use and resident in a diversity of database architectures.  Analyzing that data has proven difficult in part because most medical analytics systems developed as an outgrowth of business analytics not biomedical research.  Unfortunately business analytics information technology is not well suited for the analysis of healthcare data.  The most basic business transaction is the buying and selling of goods and services.  The semantics of business transactions are straightforward and generally accepted.  The behavior of each type of business data, and its relationship to other data can readily be defined and incorporated in an analytic model as "business rules" or metadata.  Before data can be used in business analytics or by business analytic systems, it must be well defined and its properties included in an analytic model.  These requirements severely limit the application of business analytics systems to healthcare. Clinical transactions and its associated data are fundamentally different than business transactions.  The semantics of healthcare data are not well defined or generally accepted for a broad range of healthcare data types and clinical business rules have, for the most part, yet to be developed.  The types and sources of healthcare data are both diverse and dissimilar.  The healthcare community has adopted only very limited standardized nomenclature to name data, or structure field entries.  Even within a unified organization like the Department of Veterans Affairs, there are major differences from hospital to hospital in the name and use of many of the VA's electronic medical record fields.  As a result, medical analytics requires a new generation of analytics technology that can accept and store healthcare data without first requiring semantic modeling or the pre-programming of clinical business rules. Medical analytics has additional requirements not addressed by most business analytics solutions. It must include the ability to analyze and find patterns across millions of rows of physiologic or genomic data and determine temporal relationships among all the diverse data sets. It must provide a true "ad hoc" and iterative query environment with rapid query response times despite billions of records.  Furthermore, the architecture of many business intelligence, statistical or graphical visualization software tools requires that the data to be analyzed undergo 'pre-analyses' and be removed from the analytics system computer to the user's computer.  This distribution of patient specific data is a threat to patient confidentiality and privacy. 

VISN 2 REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL ANALYTICS. Within any ICU/ARK Analytics system procured for VISN 2, the need for the medical Analytics component is to implement functionality for:
a.	integrated critical care data among the VistA systems of the VISN and the CIS (or ICU CIS and ARK),
b.	compliance with national standards for critical care data,
c.	clinical and managerial use of the data through specialized, critical-care-data-aware analytics,  
d.	providing reports and export of critical care data that is compliant with national data standards.
The needed functionality supports and extends the meaningful use of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meaningful Use refers to a requirement of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology not just the use EHRs, but to use the records to meet health care goals. 

In the critical care setting, medical analytics must allow physicians and other clinicians to leverage the value of data generated by clinical information systems and medical devices to:

a.  Determine and implement best practice (comparative effectiveness), 
b.  Reduce medical errors,
c.  Add value to traditional research initiatives, and
d.  Improve the quality the care. 

  Medical Analytics can play a critical role in improving the quality and reducing the cost of health care. The desired outcome will enable healthcare professionals to directly access clinical data stores, which will improve patient care, reduce medical errors, and enable a broad range of research capabilities. The software and hardware shall be compatible with all existing computer programs/operating systems currently installed and shall allow for future upgrades to the existing systems in VISN 2.  These shall include but not be limited to the Electronic Medical Records (EMR), VISTA/CPRS, Most Current Microsoft Windows Products, Microsoft Office Products, Internet Explorer, VA Windows Based programs, Citrix, and VA antivirus software.  All software to be provided under any resulting contract shall be Section 508 compliant. Application will not interfere with VA approved programs including but not limited to VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), VHA Barcode Medication Administration System (BCMA), Internet browser, and so forth. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 1: An analytic solution must be capable of extracting value from clinical data stores, (including but not limited to CIS (ICU and ARK), VISTA, and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), specifically addressing issues relating to clinical quality; medical errors; healthcare costs; and comparisons of costs, practice patterns, and outcomes in addition to clinical and comparative effectiveness research endeavors. The healthcare analytics shall accept extract data from VISTA to include (but not limited to) data regarding inpatient and outpatient medications, Patient Treatment File (PTF) data, orders, allergies, code status (including Crisis Notes, Warning Notes, Allergies and Directives (CWAD)), problem lists, vital signs, laboratory results, bed movement, the VISTA Surgery Package (including NSQIP elements), and from a CIS.  Types of data include all clinical and administrative data-and specifically very granular data-recording physiologic and other clinical measurements as frequently as every 30 seconds.  The granularity of the analytic tables shall reflect and directly relate to the clinical unit of inquiry and source system extract capabilities. The solution must accept data from any clinical system that is Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) compliant or able to export or "print" to flat files.  The analytic solution shall be capable of including data from diverse sources, and specifically shall be able to integrate VISTA, ICU, and Operating Room (OR) clinical systems data, regardless of vendor or model. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 1a: The analytic solution shall be capable, at a minimum, of processing updates on a daily basis from the CIS, ARK, VISTA, and NSQIP data sources.  The supporting data stores shall store data at the most detailed level captured by the CIS and still support high performance query response times. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 2: Analytics data shall span not only the entire critical care or surgical visit and include data from numerous sources as defined herein but also relevant historic healthcare data for each patient (prior hospitalizations, ICU encounters, operations, diagnoses, etc.).  The analytic database must be capable of including data from diverse sources and must specifically be able to: 

a.  Integrate CIS/ARK and VISTA data, 
b.  Accept data from any system that can export data, regardless of underlying software or hardware platform, and 
c.  Store and integrate data from all major ICU and OR clinical information system vendors. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 3: The analysis of detailed physiologic and assessment data offers an unprecedented opportunity to advance the quality of patient care. Analytics design shall specifically allow for the storage and analysis of all very granular data captured by the CIS or ARK rather than a sample or summary of the data.  Physiologic data, including but not limited to, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, shall be captured by the CIS at least once a minute.  The analytic database must provide access to (store and retrieve) physiologic data at the most detailed level available from the monitoring device or source clinical information system including digitized waveform.  At a minimum, it must store thirty second data from the OR and sixty second data from the ICU and provide for the future addition and analysis of genomic data. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 4:  Permit clinical users who understand the data but do not have programming skills to directly analyze clinical data from ICU/ARK systems and VISTA.  New queries or algorithms can be deployed without first requiring support from information technology experts.  To use the analytics, a clinical user need understand only the meaning of the data (e.g. what is a heart rate); it does not require specialized data analysis or programming skills. The analytic application or environment shall be both open and enabling.  It shall allow the user (e.g., clinician with no special technical system training) to:

a.  Investigate the contents of fields through simple statistics, sorting, bounding, and filtering; 
b.  Create new tables and new queries; and 
c.  Access analytic tables; including the ability to modify and add data elements, create new analytic tables, and author / program new queries.
 
The analytic solution, including the capability of writing new questions, shall ensure high performance query response times (typically seconds up to few minutes), even in the face of large databases and long tables. The analytic solution shall allow the user to create new analytic events and stratifications of populations from all suitable elements in the analytic solution and to join any number of elements or events using the full range of Boolean operators. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 5: Accept user-generated concepts on the fly.  The analytics system must enable users to ask clinical questions of data without knowing the question in advance (true "ad hoc" queries).  The analytic solution must allow the clinical user to create new analytic events (business rules) and stratifications of populations from all suitable elements in the analytic database but also to define data properties, define the relationship between data elements, and join any number of elements or events using the full range of Boolean operators.  The response time for these questions shall be rapid (within seconds up to few minutes). 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 6: The analytics system must include the ability to analyze and find patterns across billions of rows of physiologic or genomic data and determine temporal relationships.  The solution must be able to work across rows and to provide for sequential analysis of data (time series) for all time-stamped elements or events. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 7:  The analytics system must support an iterative query environment, allowing the clinical user to iteratively formulate, test, and refine questions and accelerate the knowledge discovery process.  The response time for the majority of these queries must on the average be rapid (within seconds up to few minutes). 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 8:  The analytics system must be a ready to use and a fully functioning commercially available system with demonstrated use in a complex clinical setting including EMR, ICU, and ARK data operations. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 9:  The analytics system shall easily support "standard" queries or reports as well as easily and rapidly develop new queries. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 10:  The analytics system shall have the capacity of developing/combing queries from individual VA facilities or from other VISNs, as well as a rollup of national data. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 11:  The analytics system shall eliminate the costly and time consuming steps that most analytic systems and business intelligence software require before data can be used. 
a.  Data shall be easily and readily available for analysis. 
b.  Data shall not require standardized nomenclature or field use. 
c.  The analytics does not require semantic modeling, the modeling of relationships or the pre-programming of clinical business rules. 

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 12:  VA Policies on Confidentiality shall be strictly adhered. The analytics must provide for the security of the data and protect the privacy of the patients with no data residing on the workstation.  The application shall meet standards set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), The Privacy Act of 1974, Enterprise Architecture standards, and VA Cyber-Security requirements.  

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 13:  The application shall be accessed through a web interface or equivalent technology with an extensive graphical user interface for sophisticated query generation including time series analyses and table joins.

<DESC>Y--Louisville District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at Fort Sheridan, IL.  <br> Solicitation Number: W912QR-13-PLA-SHERIDANARC <br>  <br> Description: The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> Construct an Army Reserve Center (ARC) which includes a training building (TRNG) that is approximately 75,000 sf, an Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS) that is approximately 6,000 sf, and associated site work. <br>  <br> The two story TRNG includes site demolition, slab-on-grade, brick veneer and insulated metal panels with concealed fasteners over insulated concrete form (icf) exterior walls, cast stone, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) roof, metal deck, structural steel frame, suspended acoustical and gypsum board ceilings, gypsum board and concrete masonry unit partitions, insulated glazing units with laminated glass in aluminum windows, hollow metal doors, aluminum storefront doors, wood interior doors, casework, interior finishes, interior and exterior lighting, elevator, exterior steel trellis, insulated overhead coiling door, HVAC and plumbing systems, communications, electric work, solar hot water system, automatic sprinklers and wet chemical suppression system, fire detection, fire pump, access control/security, site work and landscaping, sidewalks, POV parking, fire access drive, SKT pad, bioretention areas with native grasses, and utilities.  Formal LEED v3.0 silver GBCI certification is required. <br>  <br> The single story OMS includes site demolition, slab-on-grade, brick veneer over concrete masonry unit, insulated metal panels with concealed fasteners, transpired solar panel wall system, standing seam metal roof, metal deck, pre-engineered structural steel frame, 10-ton bridge crane, suspended tile and gypsum board ceilings, CMU and gypsum board partitions, insulated glazing units with laminated glass in aluminum windows, insulated exterior metal doors, interior finishes, interior and exterior lighting, insulated overhead sectional doors, HVAC and plumbing systems, communications, electrical work, automatic sprinklers, fire pump, fire detection, access control/security, site work and landscaping, sidewalks, asphalt hardstand and MEP lot, photovoltaic system, and utilities.  Formal LEED v3.0 silver GBCI certification is required.   <br>  <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Michael.D.Hutchens@usace.army.mil no later than by 1:00 PM EST on 1 March 2013.  <br>  <br>

The UAS PO Security Officers and Legal professionals will be present.  Details related to ongoing or possible future acquisition activities or plans within DoD or any of the Services will not be discussed. <br>  <br> 5.

The Government will provide a projector and power outlets.  Presenting company must provide a laptop if deemed appropriate for the presentation.  Government requests five hardcopies of the presentation, which will be closely held and protected at the conclusion of the brief.

<SUBJECT>Z--Notice of Contract Modification Issued by Olympic National Park for P12PC00598
<SOLNBR>P13PS00099
<CONTACT>
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302, 6.305 and 5.2, this special notice advertises the government's award of an urgent contract modification to Hutchinson Construction LLC (contractor selected for award no. P12PC00598 in response to solicitation no. P12PS00598) for continuation of work without interruption to incorporate change order items agreed by the parties via a Contracting Officer's Written Directive issued 12/28/12.
Comments and questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, at phaedra_fuller@nps.gov.  All comments must be received by March 20, 2013.  
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION  for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:  12/12/12		                               Requisition Number: R9500130030 Re:  Contract no. P12PC00598, Modification no. 2	
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost): This is a modification to an existing contract which has been underway since September 2012.  The project site is on a NatureBridge campus on the shore of Lake Crescent within Olympic National Park.  NatureBridge offers meeting/conference space as well as operates an education/youth outreach program for approx. 4,000 students per year. The work of this modification involves a redesign of the south entrance court for the Rosemary Inn because the design in the contract did not meet ADA/ABA Guidelines due to varied existing grades discovered during survey. Consequently, a ramp is now required to access the classroom building that was not in the original contract.  Recent heavy rains have demonstrated that there needs to be a redirection of some of the surface water to the drywell on the east because the drywell on the west is over capacity.  Other changes include small reduction in square footage of lawn restoration area, small reduction in flexible paving, addition of a downspout, and changes to crushed rock paths (small reduction in square footage in one area, and in another area delete a section and replace with sod and stepping stones).  Total modification price is $36,636.55, which will change the total contract price from $168,729.83 to $205,366.38.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below): ___Only one responsible source. _X_Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ___Other   _____________________________
Explain:  The existing contract is underway.  The urgency of this modification is because NatureBridge did not have any students lined up for January, but in February has a full schedule of students coming to the campus.  Construction of the south entry court blocks access to the only restroom available to the students.  By allowing the contractor to complete the concrete/ramp work during January, there was no issue with students not having access to a restroom on campus because there were no students scheduled in January.  It was simply not possible to push this work out into February or later, mainly because of the restroom access issue, but also because the NPS wanted to have the concrete and earth work completed before students were back on campus for safety. 
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
Market research was not done for this modification.  The redesign of the south entry court was designed by NPS landscape architect and historical architect/accessibility coordinator.  It is the design that best meets the ADA/ABA Guidelines, historic character preservation and the drainage problems. Utilizing the existing contractor was determined to be the most expeditious and cost effective way to meet NatureBridge,s time line.
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a. Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> 	HQ Army Materiel Command	 <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> 	Ft.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>

Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(f) Notice contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.<br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The following general requirements apply to these radioactive standards:
1. All standards must meet the requirements of ANSI N42.22 for traceability to an appropriate national standards laboratory, and each must be accompanied by a certificate of traceability that meets the requirements of ANSI N42.22.
2. Each standard must be accompanied by a certificate of calibration that lists the activity or emissions per second, and associated uncertainty, for each applicable radionuclide contained in, or ray emitted by, the standard.  The confidence level used for uncertainty reporting must also be stated.  For encapsulated filter standards, the thickness of the encapsulating material must also be stated on the calibration certificate.
3. Delivery must be FOB the NAREL in Montgomery, Alabama.  All charges for packaging, shipping, handling, and insurance must be included in the fixed price for the standard.  EPA will not separately pay shipping and handling charges.
4. Requested standards must be received within eight weeks after a purchase order is issued by EPA.
5. Each mixed gamma standard is to contain the following radionuclides in quantities (at time of calibration) that will result in the following approximate gamma emission rates per 1.33 microCuries of total activity.  The total nominal activity of each standard is to be either approximately 0.67 or approximately 1.33 microCuries as specified for each standard.
(SEE ATTACHMENT)
6. The standards shall have a minimum remaining shelf life of 9 months at the time of shipment.
7. The radioactivity in each standard shall be uniformly distributed, either in a simulated soil or water matrix in containers provided by EPA, or on sample collection media provided by EPA; however, certification of uniformity is not required:

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>

For information concerning this solicitation contact Olivia White via email at the above email address.  <br>  <br> 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> The Technical Approach factor is the most important factor of the overall evaluation.  Within the Technical Approach factor all sub-factors are of equal importance.  The Technical Approach factor is more important than Past Performance, and significantly more important than Price. Past Performance is slightly more important than Price. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br>  <br> Factor 1: Technical <br> Sub-factor 1: Understanding the Requirements <br> Technical sub-factor 1 will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror proposes a solution that meets the requirements set out in the Performance Work Statement and proposes a technical approach to execute work to include listing of testing facilities, and equipment available for use during the project. <br>  <br> Sub-factor 2: Corporate Experience <br> Technical sub-factor 2 will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror indicates specialized experience in providing test and analysis services of the type required under this requirement. <br>  <br> Sub-factor 3: Individual Qualifications and Experience <br> Technical sub-factor 3 will be evaluated to the extent to which the qualifications of the key personnel reflect the knowledge and experience required to perform the testing and analysis services and the certification of key personnel provided, as well as experience performing index and performance tests of this type for geotextile fabrics. <br>  <br> Factor 2. Past Performance <br> The degree to which the offeror's past performance is similar to these requirements and objectives and the degree to which the offeror's past performance demonstrated quality results within projected schedule and cost parameters. <br>  <br> Factor 3. Price <br> Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness by price analysis. The total contract price will be considered as an independent element from the technical evaluation. Price will be evaluated to determine the Offeror's understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract. <br>  <br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br> (End of provision) <br>  <br> The following clauses apply to this acquisition: <br> 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration DEC 2012 <br> 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards AUG 2012 <br> 52.209-1 Qualification Requirements FEB 1995 <br> 52.209-2 Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations-Representation MAY 2011 <br> 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items FEB 2012 <br> 52.232-1 Payments APR 1984 <br> 52.232-2 Payments Under Fixed-Price Research And Development Contracts APR 1984 <br> 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim OCT 2004 <br> 52.243-1 Alt V Changes--Fixed-Price (Aug 1987) - Alternate V APR 1984 <br> 252.204-7003 Control Of Government Personnel Work Product APR 1992 <br> 252.232-7007 Limitation Of Government's Obligation MAY 2006 <br> 252.235-7011 Final Scientific or Technical Report NOV 2004 <br> 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR <br> EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (NOV 2012) <br> (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br> (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded to American Eurocopter Corporation on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.<br />It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.</p>

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 0007 to the Eglin AFB solicitation SPE600-12-R-0827 has been posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website and can be found at www.fbo.gov. The purpose of the amendment is to revise the cut-off date from February 19, 2013 at 4:00pm Eastern Standard Time to March 5, 2013 at 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time for the Receipt of Proposals. Please note: It is the responsibility of each offeror to review Amendment 0007 for all changes from the solicitation document.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well. DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.</p>
<p>UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING JCP: DLA Energy will no longer accommodate those vendors that have not received certification through JCP by providing information via DVD/CD with the submission of the DD2345, effective January 16, 2013. Please ensure DLA Energy is immediately made aware of any issues with receiving your certification.</p>
<p>Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages. <br /><br />Please include all Points of Contact in correspondence. Points of contact for this procurement can be reached at the following:</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p><br />SECTION C - DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />FOR<br />MILLING MACHINES AND TRAINING</p>
<p>C.1 INTRODUCTION <br />This requirement is for two vertical milling machines and associated training for the 22nd Maintenance Battalion, General Support Company, Support Plt, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The milling machines are required to repair the transmissions of Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAV).</p>
<p>C.2 BACKGROUND <br />The Support Platoon is responsible to repair the AAV transmissions. The machine shop can repair the transmissions, in most cases, with the proper machine tools and software. The vertical milling machine is required to perform the complex machining repairs on the AAV transmissions. Such repairs cannot be completed in a convenient fashion without the Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. For the individual Marine to write the code required to perform the manufacture/repair of several different types of repair parts would take weeks. The CAM software will increase productivity by allowing the Marine machinist to set up and program the milling machine within a day.</p>
<p>C.3 SCOPE OF WORK <br />The increased capability that the milling machine would bring will provide the Marine machinist in the Intermediate Maintenance Activity the tools needed to maintain the advanced vehicle and weapon platforms the Marine Corps is moving towards. As the technological advancements in weapons, armor and transportation assets continues to keep our fighting forces on the cutting edge, so too must our Machinists have the ability to program complex parts and maintain the tolerance required to produce, repair and fabricate the parts needed by the war fighters.</p>

<p><br />PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:<br />Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the <br />Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Submitted proposals must reflect Technical, Past Performance, and Price as described in Section M. It is solely the Contractor's responsibility to ensure proposals are received within the required timeframe.</p>
<p><br />SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p><br />M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror that possesses a relevant, satisfactory performance record. In accordance with FAR Part 12.206 Past Performance will be evaluated. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror when the offeror's past performance record demonstrates anything other than satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and select an offer based on the initial evaluation of proposals received in response to the solicitation. Therefore, offerors are cautioned that their initial proposals should contain their best terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, the evaluation criteria that will be used for/applied to all proposals received in response to this solicitation are: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency. All timely proposals will be evaluated and an award will be made without discussion with vendors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>M.1.1 FACTOR #1 - TECHNICAL. A mere statement that the vendor will meet the Government requirement is NOT sufficient. The proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror possesses the capability required to successfully perform the requirements of the solicitation. Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using non-cost/price factors. Technical capability will be evaluated on contract requirements listed in Sections B and C of this solicitation (See Section L for instructions to offerors ).</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated first on price. The lowest price offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability and satisfactory past performance. When an offer is determined to technically acceptable with satisfactory past performance, no further evaluations will be conducted and award will be made to that offeror.</p>
<p><br />M.1.2 FACTOR #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE. Offeror(s) shall submit information as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.2 in this solicitation. Information provided in the proposal shall include similar contracts with Federal, State, and local governments, as well as commercial businesses. Similar contracts are defined as those similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to this procurement.</p>
<p>M.1.2.1 Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the offeror's, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' demonstrated past performance in delivering quality services and in meeting schedule requirements on similar programs. The performance risk assessment will address the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the contract requirements based on relevant past performance. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. Problems not addressed by the offeror will be considered to still exist.</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated to the extent to which they demonstrate satisfactory performance on contracts or subcontracts currently ongoing or completed within the last three (3) years. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in evaluating the offeror's past performance. Past performance is an indicator of how current and/or previous customers assess contractor performance under a specific contract performed for them and address the full range of all functions required to make any contractual relationship work. Successful past performance indicates that a contractor understands and has the resources to successfully execute a contract; however, it does not necessarily mean a contractor has the resources and skills necessary to perform the specific work requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance will be based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The evaluation will include demonstrated past performance in quality of product or service, schedule, business relations, and customer satisfaction. The following table identifies the adjectival ratings and descriptions utilized in rating past performance history:</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION<br />Satisfactory Performance MET contractual requirements. <br />Unsatisfactory Performance DID NOT MEET contractual requirements.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance will receive a "neutral" rating, that will have neither a positive nor negative effect. If there is no record of relevant past performance, offerors must affirmatively state this.</p>
<p>M.1.3 FACTOR #3 - PRICE. Offerors shall submit price/proposal as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.3 in this solicitation. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>*ALL OFFERORS*</strong> Orginally, when&nbsp;the question came up about the requirement of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPP) we stated that it was not required for this contract. As of now, we DO require the SWPP, and the close date for this solicitation is being extended to Friday,&nbsp;22 February 2013, 3:00 PM CST to allow all offerors time to revise their total proposal amounts to include the cost of the SWPP. An updated copy of the original proposal IS NOT necessary. We simply need a document&nbsp;showing the original proposal amount, the SWPP&nbsp;price,&nbsp;and the new overall total. Feel free to submit this information via fax, email, or by postal service by the time and date above.<br /><br />Also, I have been out of the office for the past two weeks for a class. I am currently catching up on emails and voicemails, and I will reply to all messages as soon as possible. <br /><br />Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns that you may have.

<a href="mailto:parris.s.weidenbach.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>Product Manager Wideband Enterprise Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Systems (PM WESS), Fort Belvoir, VA, is seeking information from potential offerors for the contemplated acquisition of frequency converters and rack integration services.  <br>    <br>  Large and small businesses that are experienced in providing frequency converters and rack integration services are requested to respond to this RFI. Small business is defined by North American Industry Association Classification System (NAICS) 334220, (750 employees or less).   <br>    <br>  PM WESS will replace legacy AN/GSC-52A, AN/GSC-39 and AN/GSC-78 satellite earth terminals world-wide with the AN/GSC-52B Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (MET).  Several sites are equipped with satellite control equipment, including the Replacement Satellite Configuration Control Element (RSCCE), which interfaces to the legacy terminals at X-Band. The MET does not provide an X-Band interface, and the Government does not view modification of the RSCCE as practicable, so frequency converters are required to interface the RSCCE to the MET at L-Band.  The satellite control equipment will interface to the MET via the Replacement Radio Frequency Interconnecting Subsystem (RRFIS).  <br>    <br>  The Government tentatively plans to include the following equipment and services in a pending solicitation. The entire effort consists of two distinct tasks: provide up- and down-converters with the required frequency conversion, and integrate the converters into rack assemblies that can be deployed to fixed sites world-wide. Installation of the rack assemblies will be performed by others.  <br>    <br>  Task 1 consists of providing up- and down-converters with the required frequency conversions:  <br>    <br>  a.  Provide up-converters capable of translating a 1350 MHz carrier with 250 kHz bandwidth to 7600 MHz and a 1354.7059 MHz carrier with 250 kHz bandwidth to 7604.7059 MHz. (This converter translates the L-Band downlink from MET to the X-Band receive frequency of the RSCCE.) The converter may provide sufficient bandwidth to perform both conversions without tuning or the carrier frequency may be selectable.  <br>     <br>  b.  Provide down-converters capable of translating an 8000 MHz carrier with 50 MHz bandwidth to 1100 MHz and an 8370 MHz carrier with 50 MHz bandwidth to 1470 MHz. (This converter translates the X-Band transmit frequency of the RSCCE to the L-Band uplink of the MET.) The converter may provide sufficient bandwidth to perform both conversions without tuning or the carrier frequency may be selectable.  <br>    <br>  c.  Provide manuals for the up-and down-converters addressing operation, theory of operation, maintenance and installation in contractor format.  <br>    <br>  d.  Perform first-article and production testing of the converters.  <br>    <br>  The converters must exhibit low thermal noise, low phase noise, low spurious outputs and provide excellent stability, amplitude flatness and phase linearity. Detailed requirements will be provided if the contemplated solicitation is released. The converters must be remote controllable via either RS-485 or Ethernet. Up to 30 up-converters (TBR) and up to 30 down-converters (TBR) are contemplated to be required to populate up to six rack assemblies (four up- and four down-converters per rack plus spares).   <br>    <br>  Task 2 consists of integrating the converters into rack assemblies:  <br>    <br>  a.  Integrate four up- and four down-converters into each of six rack assemblies with three up- and three down-converters on-line and one each in hot standby. Automatic protection switching is preferred, but manual protection switching using patch panels is acceptable.  <br>    <br>  b.  Integrate additional hardware such as line amplifiers, attenuators and equalizers into the rack assemblies as required to meet the interface requirements of the RSCCE and the RRFIS.  Interface specifications for the RSCCE and RRFIS will be provided if the contemplated solicitation is released.  <br>    <br>  c.  Provide monitor and control (M&C) software, installable on a Government furnished Microsoft Windows  7 based personal computer. The M&C software shall at a minimum support configuration and status monitoring of the converters. It is desirable to provide M&C of all active components in the rack.  <br>    <br>  d.  Provide detail drawings, assembly drawings, schematics and parts lists for the integrated rack assembly and its components.  <br>    <br>  e.  Provide a manual for the integrated rack assembly addressing operation, theory of operation, maintenance and installation in contractor format.  <br>    <br>  f.  Perform a thermal analysis of the rack assembly.  <br>    <br>  g.  Perform first-article and production testing of the rack assemblies.  <br>    <br>  h.  Support on-site testing of the first-article.  <br>    <br>  The production and integration services contemplated will be performed at the Contractor's facilities. On-site testing of the first-article will be performed at the following Government facilities: Ft. Detrick, MD. Interested potential offerors may provide responses for any one or both of the tasks described above. Interested potential offerors are asked to provide the following specific information.  <br>    <br>  a.  Name, address, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code of your company.  <br>    <br>  b.  Point of Contact (Name address, phone number, and e-mail).  <br>    <br>  c.  Current capabilities your company offers which most closely match the capabilities specified above.  <br>    <br>  d.  Available brochures, photographs, illustration and technical descriptions that describe your company's current products and services that most closely match the required capabilities.  <br>    <br>  e.  An optional White Paper (no more than 20 pages in length) describing how your company's technical expertise could produce and deliver the required capability.  <br>    <br>  f.  An identification of your company's past and current customers to which your company provided similar services, including a customer/company name and point of contact, phone number, and address/e-mail where they can be contacted.  <br>    <br>  g.  Pricing structure for required supplies and services.  <br>    <br>  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed in any manner to create an obligation on the part of Government to enter into any agreement, nor to implement any of the actions contemplated herein, nor to serve as the basis for any claim whatsoever for reimbursement for any costs associated with the preparation of responses submitted to the RFI.  <br>    <br>  Please furnish the above requested information by 25 February 2013.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey and/or meetings.  Any cost associated with market survey submittals and meetings is solely at the interested vendor's expense. 

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined for the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP).  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

I. INTRODUCTION

This market survey is the second announcement regarding the FFSP. This market reseach is a continuation of the information gathering process initiated under Market Survey 11279, which was posted on the FAA's Contract Opportunities website on 10 November 2011. 

The FFSP Program Office is looking to conduct communications with industry for assistance in identifying any vendors possessing special knowledge and unique capabilities. 

These communications and/or meetings are being conducted prior to the formal start of the acquisition process and will not be subject to any evaluation.  This is not a down select of any kind and non-participation will not disqualify vendors from subsequent consideration. 

Information gathered during the previous market survey and theses communications and/or meetings may be used in the development of the acquisition and the future draft Statement of Objectives (SOO). Information provided may also be used to assist the FAA in determining the eventual composition of the infrastructure under which flight services may be provided.  

Any proprietary or confidential information provided during communications and/or meetings should be appropriately marked and identified. Information not identified as proprietary could potentially incorporate in the FFSP requirements.

II. PURPOSE

The purpose of this market survey is to offer interested vendors and industry groups the opportunity to participate in communications with representatives from the FFSP Program Office regarding innovative methods and approaches to provide future flight services, which encompasses a portfolio consisting of Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS), Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) and Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS).  FFSP will be a service-based program; therefore, the FAA is not interested in pursuing a system-based solution.

III. NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE

The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330, Engineering Services. 

IV. TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION

Current and anticipated Federal budget constraints demand that the FAA continually evolve more cost effective methodologies of providing Flight Services to the General Aviation Community and other existing or potential Flight Service users while maintaining or enhancing the level of safety that can be derived through utilization of those services.  

The FAA envisions that FFSP will not be specialist-centric. Rather, the FAA anticipates that FFSP will provide easier access and enhanced functionality for pilots. Flight services will be automated to a greater extent, allowing both pilots and specialists to access the same data/information. 

The table provided in "Attachment A: Current and Potential Delivery of Flight Services" compares the delivery of flight services today with that anticipated for flight service improvements.
	
Interested vendors should be prepared to discuss the following topics during the communications and/or meetings: 

1.	Commercial and industry best practices that can be utilized to enhance providing flight services. 

2.	Innovative methods that the FAA and Industry might utilize to provide flight services. This includes, but is not limited to: 

	Restructuring, reducing, modifying, and/or enhancing flight services while considering effects on safety.

	Easier access and enhanced automated functionality to provide flight service for pilots while considering effects on safety.

	Government Furnished Information (GFI), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and/or Government Furnished Property (GFP) that potential industry partners may find beneficial in providing more cost effective safety enhanced flight services (Wx Products, Traffic Flow Data, etc.) and reduced transition risk.

	Potential to leverage 'Cloud' computing (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS) in a new flight services model (Storage / new applications).

NOTE: Although areas of interest are identified above, respondents are not restricted or required to address these areas and should not consider the areas as constraints in the response.

3.	Transition requirements concerns.

4.	Potential integration of NextGen Programs into flight services.  

5.	Alternative acquisition approaches to provide flight services that could provide continuous improvements in terms of efficiency at a reduced cost to the FAA while still considering safety. 

6.	Opportunities to encourage and increase small business participation in the delivery of flight services.

V. FFSP DOCUMENTS PREVIOUSLY POSTED

Previously released FFSP documents have been posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities web site, at www.faa.gov/faaco under Market Survey Announcement #11279 dated 10 November 2011.

Although previous market survey documents include certain considerations and assumptions for FFSP, the FAA is open to all ideas for discussion.  For the purposes of these communications and/or meetings, respondents are not restricted to the information contained in the previous FFSP market survey documentation.

VI. SCHEDULING ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS

A website has been established for the purpose of scheduling one-on-one meetings industry representatives. Those planning to participate must register via the web site.  The web site address is: 

http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/ffs/

Upon receipt of registration, interested parties will be contacted by the FFSP Program Office to schedule meetings.	

One-on-one meetings are not mandatory.  Written submittals will also be accepted from any interested party wishing to submit information or comments. Vendors interested in providing written submittals should follow the above registration process and check the box for written submittals. The FFSP Program Office will contact these vendors upon receipt of registration to provide further instruction.

For vendors interested in providing a written response, responses must be provided in a common electronic readable format (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF), in Times New Roman 12 pt. font.  Company background shall be limited to one page. There is no limit on page responses.  

Questions regarding the scheduling process should be directed to Jane Christoff via email at jane.christoff@faa.gov.

VII. CONDUCT OF ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS

Meetings are open to all interested vendors and industry groups regardless of whether a response was provided to the previous Market Survey 11279.  

It is anticipated that meetings will be conducted within a 90 minute timeframe. If additional time is needed, interested vendors should provide notification on the registration. Up to five (5) representatives from each vendor may participate in the one-on-one meetings with the FFSP Team.  

At a minimum, vendors should provide a brief presentation, 30 minutes or less, to include the five (5) questions identified in Section IV of this market survey. 

Respondents should note that the Government may elect to electronically record and/or document each one-on-one meeting to ensure an accurate record of the meetings.

<DESC>This is a modification to the RFI titled, "Development of an On-Orbit Robotic Servicing Capability for Spacecraft" which was posted on November 3, 2011. You are hereby notified of the following: The Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is conducting a Servicing Payload Systems Requirements Review (SRR) on March 25-26, 2013.  The meeting will be held at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD 20771, from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm each day, and will be open to U.S. organizations interested in partnering with NASA on a potential geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) servicing mission, subject to the procedures described below.  This review will examine the functional and performance requirements defined for the servicing payload and will ensure that the requirements and selected concept satisfy the mission needs.	 This announcement serves as a notice only and is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  Neither the review nor this announcement constitutes a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  This notice does not constitute, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take further action on this matter.  Participation in the review is voluntary and is not required to propose to any future solicitation. NASA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to attend this review. Program Description:  The SSCO wishes to advance the state of robotic servicing technology to enable the routine servicing of satellites that were not designed with servicing in mind.  NASA encourages the creation of a domestic commercial capability that meets both future Government and non-government needs.	The strategy for achieving these objectives involves collaboration with private domestic entities that leverage the governments existing intellectual property, technological resources, and expertise.  To achieve these objectives NASA is exploring a Government-commercial partnership to demonstrate an on-orbit servicing capability for client satellites located in GEO.  Such a capability would potentially provide life extension servicing over a range of candidate client satellites.  Specific on-orbit servicing capabilities may include remote survey, relocation, refueling, repair, and component replacement.  Review Information:  The goal in having potential partners attend this review is to familiarize participants with the current servicing payload requirements for a servicing mission.  An SRR for the Servicing Mission would be conducted once a Partner is on-board. See http://ssco.gsfc.nasa.gov	 for additional technical background on SSCO servicing technologies.  See https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=b3a0b821a9325ffe5e9c0e372f14588c &_cview=0   for additional background information and the earlier releases of this RFI. It is the responsibility of any potential offerors/bidders to monitor FedBizOpps or the NASA Acquisition Internet Service websites for the release of additional information, solicitation, synopsis, or related documents.  Registration Information:  Interested parties must register in order to attend.  To register send an e-mail to both claudia.canales-1@nasa.gov and mary.reph@nasa.gov with the name, affiliation, e-mail address and phone number of proposed attendees.  The registration deadline is 5:00 pm EDT, March 8, 2013 .  Participants must register no later than this time/date.  Visitors will not be admitted without prior registration.  This invitation is intended for organizations who are able to fulfill all or most of the aspects of the partnership as a potential prime offeror.  Due to the content of the presentations and facility security requirements, only U.S. citizens may attend.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated future solicitation. Qualified organizations not able to attend but who are interested in this partnership should contact the GSFC SSCO by sending an e-mail to both claudia.canales-1@nasa.gov and mary.reph@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a non-competitive order for healthcare organization accreditation services (2013 base with two one year options for 2014 and 2015) to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A Request for Proposal is not available. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
<p>The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) has historically utilized the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' services for their hospital accreditations. IHS OIT has significant time and money invested into the development of data marts and transmission standards to support use of the JCAHO for hospital accreditation services. The JCAHO transmission standards are (as are all accreditation vendors) a proprietary design; consequently, any alternative application would require significant re-development and cost to the government in order to transition. Based on this, IHS intends to pursue this sole source acquisition. However, any vendor believing that they can provide the product/service listed above may submit a written email response to Michelle Kouis (Contract Specialist) at michelle.kouis@ihs.gov no later than February 22, 2013 (5 pm Eastern).</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

<DESC>DHS has a requirement on a sole source basis to extend Battelle Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00048 for up to 4 months (4) for critical research and development (R&amp;D) laboratory operations and associated technical support services. The proposed period of performance for this action is February 16, 2013 through April 15, 2013 with two (2) one month options.
<p>The current Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-000048 was awarded on June 1, 2012 for a period of 6 months as a sole source award under DHS LSJ No. 071-12 on an interim measure until such time as the award of a follow-on contract vehicle can be made through full and open competition. Since the expiration of this period of performance, the contract was extended IAW FAR Clause 52.217-8 (Option to Extend Services) beginning on December 1, 2012 through February 15, 2013 and was processed under DHS LSJ No. 005-13 and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate.</p>
<p>On November 23, 2012, OPO issued Request for Quotation HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 under GSA e-Buy. The Solicitation closed on December 21, 2013 and multiple proposals were received. RFQ HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 includes the research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) services that are presently covered under the interim bridge task order. The estimated milestone timeline for the award of new contract vehicles under the RFQ exceeds the period of performance available on the current task order and it is critical that TSL continue to maintain contract coverage while the RFQ proposal evaluations are underway. The estimated award timeline is March, 2013. For this proposed action, LSJ No. 051-13 has been coordinated and approved by the OPO Competition Advocate. See attached.</p>
<p>In accordance with the requirements of FAR 8.402(f) and competition requirements of FAR Part 6, an open market J&amp;A document has been prepared to cover the ODC portion of this action. See attached J&amp;A No. 052-13.</p>
