<DESC>This Sources Sought is for Infusion Pumps and Infrastructure to support them for a VISN-Wide IDIQ Contract for VISN 01 as shown in the attached specifications.  The intent of this Request for information is to put in place a Base plus 4 Option Year Contract for the Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with the attached statement of Work.

Statement of Work
Infusion Pumps   VISN1-WIDE
A.1 Instructions to Offerors
Veterans Integrated Support Network 1 (VISN 1) desires to offer its Medical Centers; including VA Boston Healthcare Network, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, VA Providence Healthcare System, VA Central Western Massachusetts, VA Manchester, VA White River Junction, VA Bedford and VA Maine, a quality product at competitive prices.   The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFQ) is to create a Blank Purchase Agreement (BPA) which will allow all VISN 1 Medical Centered to purchase a Smart Infusion Pump System or components at a firm fixed price as determined in this agreement.   The VISN 1 medical centers are in need of a system which can be used for all of their current drug delivery and monitoring needs; including but not limited to large volume drug delivery, syringe drug delivery, patient controlled analgesia drug delivery, and pulse oximetry (SPO2) monitoring.  The product and system requirements can be found in section A.2.  The facility profiles for the medical centers who will execute orders against this BPA can be found in section A.3.
The offeror shall include in their proposal the itemized cost schedule of all equipment, parts, software, software licensing fees, infrastructure (i.e.) servers and other network infrastructure devices), and services required to implement the proposed solution including on-going maintenance costs.
The offerors shall clearly identify any open market items (including pricing of such items) included in the proposal.
The Blanket Purchase Agreement will have a period of performance lasting five (5) years from date of award.  The first year will refer to the base year with each subsequent year being an option year.  The offeror must provide a supply of Infusion Pump System products for the life of the resulting BPA.  At no time during the period of performance of this BPA shall the prices exceed the agreed upon BPA prices.
This BPA does not obligate any funds, nor is the Government obligated to make any purchases under this BPA.
As the order resulting from this RFQ will exceed the maximum order threshold for Schedule 65IIA, SIN A-64, the VA requests a price reduction from FSS pricing, IAW FAR 8.405.1(d).
The offeror shall submit a concise narrative (ten pages or less) of how their offer meets the technical requirement of the solicitation.  The narrative shall contain all products which include all features listed as  Required  in Section A.2.  The offerors shall not include equipment not meeting all required features in their proposal.  Offerors shall indicate which features listed as  Optional  are included in the equipment offered.

The Offeror shall also provide a proposal including required items to implement a full installation of the offeror s system across all of the VISN 1 facilities listed in Section A.3.   The facility profiles are also listed in Section A.3.  Currently, bed count is offered as a tool to assist with the offerors VISN 1 implementation proposal.  
All quantity discounts shall be factored into the cost schedule for the full period of performance of this contract.  
Delivery Schedule: The timeline and plan for implementation at each VISN 1 medical center is to be determined by each medical center individually or by the VISN offices.  The Offeror shall assume that greater than fifty percent (50%) of the VISN will replace their inventory within the first two (2) years of the BPA.
Channel Capability: The offered equipment should be capable of up to four (4) channels to include but are not limited to large volume, syringe, PCA, and SPO2.
Software:  The system and each component shall have a Dose Error Reduction system (DERS) that detects and prevents most dose-related programming errors and programming of inappropriate or unreasonable infusion.
The system and each component should permit configuration of its drug library to a facility s current ordering and delivery practices (i.e., customization of drug names, concentrations, and dosing units); and should be able to specify entire drug names.
The system and each component should permit a facility to set total dose and time limits for delivering boluses and intermittent infusions and to associate clinical advisories with any of the drugs/solutions in its library.
The software should maintain a history log that stores all drug libraries and limit sets by the date they were enabled and identifies all staff who has signed off on each library.  The software should permit easy (e.g., spreadsheet), access-controlled review, editing, and batch programming of the facility s customized drug library and limit sets for each clinical location and application (i.e., for initial programming or for subsequent updates or configuration changes).  A facility should be able to upload existing drug libraries to the software.
Software upgrade should not be burdensome; pumps should incorporate design elements that facilitate software upgrades
Offerors must describe the server requirements needed by the entire VISN to implement a full roll out of their solution if the VISN were to replace the entire inventory in the first year of the BPA. This shall include all of the proposed software, including all security access needed, data sharing, communication protocols, and functionality that the VA has to provide in order for the proposed DERS system to fully function.  This information should be included in the completed VA form 6550 as provided as part of this solicitation.
Communication: The system should allow two-way wireless communication to transfer new drug libraries and software updates from a central server to the pumps, and to transfer events and alarm logs from the pumps to the server.  The availability of wired communication is desirable in the event of a problem with the wireless network.  Wireless communication should use existing technologies to allow hospitals to take advantage of existing infrastructure which are 802.11 a/b/g using both 2.4 gHz and 5 gHz.  All wireless technology shall be FIP 140-2 compliant.
Consumables:  The Offeror shall identify and describe all consumables which can be used by each component of the system and the cost for each item based on the profiles of the hospitals in Section A.3.  All applicable quantity discounts shall be applied.
Equipment Cleaning:  Offerors shall describe cleaning procedures and approved cleaning products for the offered equipment and state whether cleaning instructions are included in the product literature.  The chemical makeup of the cleaning product shall be clearly identified in the offer. 
Customer Support: Offerors shall describe the customer support program, including but not limited to in-house training for clinical users, biomedical support, and handling trouble calls.
Orientation/Training: Offerors shall describe the method of orientation and training of clinical users.  The government desires training for clinical users and biomedical equipment personnel.  Offerors should provide details on the vendor-provided training available and specify whether training is included with the equipment purchased or priced separately.  If multiple training options are available, offerors should describe each in their offer.
Past Performance: As part of their proposal, offerors shall provide past performance information on their three most recent contracts of similar size and scope.  Offerors shall complete RFQ attachment 1, Past Performance Reference Sheet and return along with their offer.  The Offeror shall provide a list of all recalls and alerts pertaining to their product line for the past three (3) years from the date of the solicitation.
Integration:  As part of their proposal, the Offerors shall provide a list of tested and verified Electronic Medical Record systems (i.e., Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), CliniComp, and VISTA) which their system has been tested and verified to communicate with. The level of communication should include but is not limited to drug delivery quantities, infusion rates, drug delivery times, and other patient care related data.

A.3 Security Clauses
GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.
5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor  owned equipment or software on VA s network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA- approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre- approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident 
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. §5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
Description of the event, including:
date of occurrence;
data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
 Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
Notification;
One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
Data breach analysis;
Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
