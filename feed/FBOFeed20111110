Due to recent world events it is imperative for security that incoming cargo conveyances are subjected to a high level of scrutiny. Therefore, CBP seeks to procure large-scale NII imaging systems, such as X-Ray and Gamma systems, for various POEs, located throughout the United States as designated by CBP.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support Activity, within the Department of Defense, is hereby generating the DRAFT solicitation to the Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) Japan Tailored Logistics Support Program. The purpose of this initiative is to establish the third generation program for the Japan Region for logistics support of military installations, federal agencies, and other authorized customers within the geographic area. It is anticipated to continue the Tailored Logistics Support Program under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for MRO materials. The contract term of this action is a two year base to include a 60 day "ramp-up" (if necessary) with two eighteen month unilateral option periods. Offer on the option portion is mandatory. A minimum of two and a maximum of four contracts are anticipated to the lowest price technically acceptable utilizing LPTA Source Selection procedures. All resulting orders will be competed with those awardees.
<p>Attachment ONE contains a "Core list" of frequently used items in the region and is as a representative sample of the items to be included in the basic solicitation. There may be minor modifications to the core list prior to issuing the final solicitation. For the final solicitation, initial pricing for the 500 core list items will serve as the ceiling price for the first six months of the base period. Items subject to more pricing volatility will be so identified and have the pricing fixed as a ceiling price for the first three months of the base period. Offerors will also have to submit pricing for the 500 core list items for each option period. Subsequently, pricing for the 500 core list items will serve as the ceiling price for the first six months of each option period, and items identified as subject to more pricing volatility will have the pricing fixed as a ceiling price for the first three months of each option period. At this time, DLA Troop Support MRO welcomes your comments to the draft solicitation. Written comments shall be received (via e-mail) and addressed to: meghan.michalski@dla.mil on or before July 12, 2011 and may be considered for inclusion in the final solicitation. DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL as NO evaluations will be conducted at this time. The government will not issue direct responses to vendor comments or questions. If submitting comments, make reference to the specific page and text of this draft RFP. Due to the anticipated level of interest, DLA Troop Support will not entertain individual requests for contractor visits or marketing calls.</p>

I. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is to determine if qualified vendors are interested in an upcoming interim contract opportunity for the Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS). 
This interim contract opportunity will provide a bridge between end of the two existing DUATS contracts and the implementation of a new program - the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP)
II. INTRODUCTION/ BACKGROUND
The FAA anticipates the implementation of a new program - the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP), which will combine the services currently provided by the Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS), DUATS, and Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) programs into a single contract vehicle. FFSP will be a service-based program. FFSP will replace the program previously known as the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS). The FAA expects a contract for FFSP will be awarded in 2014 and to have a fully operational flight service infrastructure in place in mid 2015. See attached table, Attachment D, Current Flight Service Functions to be replaced by FFSP.
The FAA requires current internet-based flight service functions provided under DUATS to continue until the functionality is provided under FFSP. The estimated period of performance for the interim contract opportunity is 18 months.
III. DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT FLIGHT SERVICE FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY DUATS
DUATS provides weather data, aeronautical information, and flight planning services pertinent to the pilot's route of flight.  Services are provided in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.10U. Current Flight Services provided by DUATS include:
	PRE-FLIGHT - Preflight pilot briefing includes the available weather and aeronautical data for the intended flight for flight planning purposes. The pilot is responsible for interpreting the data. 
	FLIGHT PLAN FILING - The completion and submission of the electronic flight plan to Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) or Flight Service facilities. Verify routing and provide additional information such as preferred routings.
IV. DELIVERY OF CURRENT FLIGHT SERVICE FUNCTIONS BY DUATS
DUATS is a weather information and flight plan processing service that allows pilots to conduct self briefings and obtain flight services without the aid of a Flight Service Specialist.  The FAA contracts for this service include two separate vendors, who each bill the FAA monthly based on the number of transactions with users.  
DUATS is internet based, with technical support available via telephone to resolve access issues; however, no operational expertise is offered.  Connectivity is provided via the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN)-II, which interfaces with the Weather Message Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) system for weather advisories and with air traffic operations for filing flight plans.  DUATS provides aviation weather in both textual alphanumeric and color graphical formats.  After obtaining an online briefing, aviators can then use DUATS to file, amend, and cancel domestic VFR and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plans.  
V. INCUMBENT CONTRACTORS
DUATS is currently provided by the following contract vehicles: 
a.	Contract DTFAWA-08-C-00119 with Computer Science Corporation (CSC) b.	 Contract DTFAWA-08-C-00121 with Data Transformation Corporation (DTC)

Contract instructors may also be required to provide support as subject matter experts in the development, revision, and maintenance of course materials, utilizing all applicable media.  
The FAA may also identify requirements for other instructional support personnel including but not limited to, instructional systems design specialists, course developers, technical writers, and graphic artists, web and eLearning developers.
The instructional system design specialist is responsible for organizing and conducting research, development, evaluation, revision, and maintenance of training materials for resident, field, and distance learning training courses, supporting the National Airspace System (NAS). Knowledge of major principles and theories in human learning and cognitive psychology is required in order to determine instructional objectives and task learning relationships, classify instructional objectives, and develop course content sequences.  Additionally, knowledge of principles, methodologies, and techniques of task analysis is required in order to ensure training outcomes are congruent with required knowledge, skills, and abilities.
Instructional development and revision of course materials and support media for resident, field and web/eLearning/distance learning courses would be performed by course developers, illustrators, and technical writers with applicable experience in the following areas: art and design, drafting, desktop publishing, computer animation, courseware development authoring languages, ability to proofread and edit material for reports, manuals, briefs, proposals, instructional books, catalogs, and training publications, or related specialty materials.

Past Performance and Experience - The FAA is looking for a contractor with a proven track record of excellence in the performance of contracts in an environment of a similar size and complexity.  The contractor is required to show three (3) years experience within the past five (5) years in instructional support and delivery.  Past and present contract performance information must demonstrate the contractor is capable to perform the proposed effort.  The contractor should demonstrate technical expertise and capability to perform the requirements listed.  
This announcement is not a Screening Information Request or a Request for Proposal of any kind.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or for any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA certified 8(a) firms and small business concerns.   The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional support services.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other small business competitive procurement procedures. Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter (if applicable).
The failure to obtain adequate 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.<br />2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.<br />3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):<br />a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz. <br />b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS. <br />c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.<br />d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).<br />The four subsystems described are as follows:<br />a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.<br />b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.<br />4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.<br />5. SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE<br />The following is an outline for a response to this RFI. Please provide the following per subsystem response. This outline will minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. <br />Section 1 Technological Capability <br />Identify technological capability related to the subsystem addressed. Identify open architecture, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, software and methodologies employed for signal and antenna pattern development. Identify target processors, operating systems and development environments. Identify any proprietary aspects. Identify interface standards used. Identify Built-In-Test (BIT) capability and calibration techniques.<br />Section 2 Technological Alternatives <br />Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. Future State Concepts - The government is entertaining the idea of pursuing potential SBIR grants and other similar vehicles for new and pertinent technologies. Please provide any information, future concepts, ideas, or plans for future development that may assist any of the four areas described above. <br />Section 3 Feasibility Assessment<br />Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.<br />Section 4 Cost and Schedule Estimates<br />Provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule estimates to include a confidence estimate. These assumptions are for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking this information for market research purposes. This is not a request for proposals. It is not the expectation of the government that the contractor will provide a complete cost proposal. Projected costs with tradeoffs possibilities are preferred. In addition, the government requests cost breakdowns showing the price differentiation between Unlimited, Government purpose, and Limited Use data rights.<br />Section 5 Corporate Expertise<br />Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership and other information you deem relevant.<br />In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach and any relevant lessons learned.

NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):<br />a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz. <br />b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS. <br />c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.<br />d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).<br />The four subsystems described are as follows:<br />a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.<br />b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.<br />4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.<br />5.

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.<br />2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.<br />3.

PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.<br />3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):<br />a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz. <br />b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS. <br />c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.<br />d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).<br />The four subsystems described are as follows:<br />a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.<br />b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.<br />4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.<br />5.

<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.<br />2.

This is the synopsis of the Naval Supply System Command Weapons System Support requirement for renewal of the H-60 FLIR Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract N00383-03-D-006A, which expires 30 October 2013, for the AN/AAS-44(V) Infrared Detecting Set and the addition of the AV/AAS-44(C) Infrared Detecting Set, used in support of the SH-60B/HH-60H and MH-60R/MH-60S respectively.  The scope of this effort will encompass the repair, modification, overhaul, and replacement of hardware, including manufacturing of new material, as well as storage, requisition processing, obsolescence management and availability/reliability improvement.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Southern Africa intends to issue a limited competition RFP to select a contractor to implement its Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Service Delivery and Technical Assistance Project. The contractor will provide technical assistance and services to support high quality, high volume Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) service delivery; and to provide technical assistance to provinces and districts to start up publically-funded high quality, high volume VMMC sites. The project objectives are as follows:
<p>Objective<br />USAID/Southern Africa's key strategic objective is to assist the South African Government to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS and to provide better health care for historically disadvantaged South Africans through the targeted provision of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). The Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Service Delivery and Technical Assistance Project, in line with the overall national HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan for South Africa, 2007-2011, have the following strategic objectives:<br />1. To provide high quality, high volume, high efficiency VMMC services in KwaZulu Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Free State provinces to males aged 15-49 through existing USAID-supported VMMC sites and one new site ; and<br />2. To provide technical assistance to provinces and districts to ensure successful start-up of well placed, high volume, high quality government VMMC sites that can be sustained through public funding.</p>
<p>Contract Type and Estimated Start Date<br />USAID/Southern Africa plans to award an 18-month, hybrid Firm Fixed Price (FFP Services) and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) term contract. Contract performance is expected to begin in April - May 2012.</p>
<p>Site Visits<br />Specific dates and times to visit sites will be organized and coordinated through PEPFAR and South African and US governments, and announced through the RFP posted to FedBizOpps. Site visits are only authorized during the scheduled and publicly-announced timeframe. Letters of support from South African government officials at any level are neither required nor desired for this RFP.</p>
<p>Competition<br />USAID/ Southern Africa will compete this award. However, only local organizations in South Africa will be eligible. This is based on the following authority: AIDAR 706.203-70 and 40 U.S.C. &sect;113; and Action Memorandum entitled "Expedited Acquisition and Assistance Procedures for Activities and Programs Related to the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of HIV/AIDS," approved February 14, 2008.</p>
<p>Programmatic and technical bases for less than full and open competitive procedures (i.e. competing among local organizations) for the implementation of VMMC services are as follows:</p>
<p>1) The South African Government, through the South Africa Health Strategy and the National Strategic Plan for HIV, strongly supports the utilization of local organizations and institutions to implement health programs. The Minister of Health has stated that South Africa has world class expertise in the HIV response, and has encouraged USAID and PEPFAR to support the continued development of local capacity in this regard.</p>
<p>2) Recognizing the important potential of VMMC to dramatically reduce the number of new HIV infections in the country, South African President Jacob Zuma and the National Department of Health (NDOH) prioritized the scale up of high volume safe VMMC for HIV prevention and set a goal of 4.3 million VMMCs of males ages 15-49 (80% coverage) over 5 years. In order to support the SAG to achieve these ambitious targets, VMMC services must be delivered through high-volume VMMC sites based on the Models for Optimizing the Volume and Efficiency (MOVE). The MOVE approach is essential for the catch-up phase of VMMC as it enables approximately 50 men per day to be circumcised by a small team of service providers. It is imperative that local organizations and South African clinics create and sustain mutually beneficial relationships in terms of training and adapting to evolving technologies in order to achieve the 5-year SAG target.</p>
<p>3) To rapidly respond to the South African Government priority to scale up VMMC, USAID reprogrammed funding and added VMMC to the scopes of work of qualified treatment partners - all of which were local South African Organizations, including the organization that created the MOVE model. USAID has placed a priority on building and reinforcing the capacity of local organizations in the HIV response. These partners have conducted over 60,000 circumcisions since the launch of the scale-up in June 2010. In addition, the USAID-supported local partners have provided the vast majority of training services in the MOVE approach. Thus, the local organizations are not only technically qualified to implement the USAID activity, but they are well-situated and well-poised to help the South African Government achieve its larger target.</p>
<p>4) In many parts of South Africa circumcision is an integral part of traditional culture and associated with the rites of passage. Introducing VMMC in these areas will require intimate knowledge and understanding of the local traditions and culture so that VMMC is seen as complementing the traditions and not replacing them. VMMC is important as the procedure involves the complete removal of the foreskin in a safe sterile environment, which is not always the case for the traditional circumcisions. In these areas the introduction of VMMC is a sensitive and potentially controversial service. Due to this potential for misconceptions, extra care must be placed on ensuring complete information to and sensitization of the traditional and community leaders. A local organization will be much better placed to work with traditional leaders in a sensitive manner and assure that VMMC can be introduced in a way that will be complementary to the local traditions.</p>
<p>Finally, limiting competition to local organizations is consistent with the USAID/ Southern Africa Mission Strategy and USAID's Procurement Reform. USAID/ Southern Africa has placed an emphasis on utilizing local organizations and South African expertise to implement health and development programs for several years. This strategy has been reinforced with the recent signature of the Partnership Framework, a document signed between the South African Government and the United States Government that outlines the contributions of USG agencies and SAG departments to the HIV response over the next five years. The document is based on the principle of country ownership and building local capacity for a sustainable HIV response. Consequently the Mission has placed highest priority on building the capacity of local organizations so that they will be able to continue to provide quality HIV services for South Africans and support the South African Government priorities over the long term. In addition, USAID/ Southern Africa is at the forefront of procurement reform, with its commitment to increasing the number of awards that are made to qualified local organizations.</p>
<p>Definition of Local Organization<br />A "Local Organization" means an entity, that at the time of the award and performance of the contract or subcontract, is one that:</p>
<p>1) is organized under the laws of the Republic of South Africa;<br />2) has its principal place of business in the Republic of South Africa; <br />3) is not less than 51 percent legally and beneficially owned by one or more resident citizens of the Republic of South Africa or is managed by a governing body, the majority of whom are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the Republic of South Africa; and <br />4) is not controlled by a foreign entity or by one or more individuals who are not resident citizens of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
<p>Limitation on Sub-Awards<br />No more than 10% of the total estimated value of the contract may be sub-awarded to organizations that do not meet the definition of local organization set forth above.</p>
<p>Pre-solicitation Conference<br />There will be a Pre-solicitation Conference, as per the attached invitation. Please follow the instructions for registration. Given concerns with space availability, only registered organizations will be guaranteed entrance.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), located on the Walter Reed National Military Medical Campus (WRNMMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Harlan Laboratories N.A., Inc. for laboratory animal feed and bedding.
<p>The awarded contract will be an option year order with a base period of six (6) months with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 17.204(e). This order is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures).</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The laboratory animals have been fed and housed on Harlan Laboratories products since their arrival at USUHS and AFRRI. The current animals have been acclimated to Harlan products and prior studies have generated data based on Harlan Products. Switching food and bedding would introduce subclinical physiological changes, causing variables that could negatively impact ongoing and future research. The types of research being conducted include molecular biology, neurobiology, neuropsychology and infectious disease. Harlan Laboratories currently provides specific animal feed and bedding (Teklad Global 20% Protein Primate Diet Jumbo, Teklad Rodent Diet and Teklad "Maple" Sani Chip Bedding), which have a predictable quality control and influence on the outcome of research. Changing vendors would add uncertain variability into experimental animal conditions which could have a detrimental effect on the course of research.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to Jody.Bester@usuhs.mil by 4:00 PM (EST) on December 11, 2011.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was created in 1989 "to enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of health care services and access to such services, through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions and in the organization, financing and delivery of health care services<br />CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Services). Consumers and other purchasers of health care are among AHRQ's primary constituents. One of the Agency's goals is to help these groups make informed choices about their health care purchasing decisions. Since October of 1995, the CAHPS Consortium-CAHPS grantees, the User Network contractor and AHRQ CAHPS staff-have developed and tested surveys that consumers can use to assess the quality of care they receive through their health plans, from providers and in hospitals, nursing homes, in-center hemodialysis facilities, and other settings. The CAHPS team has also conducted research and developed guidance for reporting these data to consumers, providers and other audiences. (Detailed information about CAHPS products and history can be found at www.cahps.ahrq.gov.)</p>
<p>SOPS (Surveys on Patient Safety Culture). In the landmark study "To Err is Human," the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 1999) called for the creation of a culture of safety as a major component in a program to reduce the risk of harm to patients from the process of care. The IOM and other organizations have stressed the need to measure the safety culture in health care organizations. Organizations with a positive safety culture are characterized by communications founded on mutual trust, by shared perceptions of importance of safety, and by confidence in the efficacy of preventive measures.</p>
<p>An organization's safety culture will determine the success or failure of any safety initiatives. Yet, at the beginning of the patient safety movement, there were no valid and reliable instruments through which to assess patient safety culture. In order to meet this need, AHRQ has funded the development and testing of Surveys for Patient Safety Culture for care delivered in hospitals, medical offices, nursing homes and pharmacies. AHRQ also funds databases that collect data for each of these surveys through voluntary contributions from users, analyzes these data, and prepares reports based on them.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to operate the CAHPS User Network and infrastructure. More specifically, this contractor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain of CAHPS and SOPS products.<br />&bull; Provide technical assistance to CAHPS and SOPS product users. <br />&bull; Promote the adoption and use of CAHPS products and SOPS surveys.<br />&bull; Develop new and maintain existing CAHPS and SOPS databases.<br />&bull; Conduct meetings and conferences.<br />&bull; Develop timelines and manage all aspects of the project work.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the development, testing, implementation and use of patient experience surveys, especially CAHPS; and development, testing, implementation and use of AHRQ Surveys of Patient Safety Culture. This includes knowledge of and experience working with all potential users of these products, as well as barriers to use of CAHPS and SOPS data in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Maintain the two existing CAHPS databases and the four SOPS databases. Both the CAHPS and SOPS databases have over a million records and will likely double in size in the next two years.</p>
<p>Develop at least three new databases. This includes developing instructions through which users can submit their data; cleaning the data; analyzing data and producing up to 10 chart books per year; maintaining security of the data and updating software on a regular basis to eliminate threats to security.</p>
<p>Provide technical assistance to users of CAHPS and SOPS survey products. The contract receives over 1000 requests for assistance each year. About 70% of the calls require less than 30 minutes for a response; about 20% require two days, including consultation with other project staff; the remaining 10% require 10 days. To develop accurate responses, a contractor must understand all survey administration activities such as sampling procedures; response biases; data analysis; reporting survey results to a variety of audiences, including consumers, researchers, QI professionals and the electronic and print media. The contractor must have the ability to explain all aspects of survey implementation in language that users can understand, including users who are unfamiliar with data collection procedures.</p>
<p>Collaborate in the development of materials that instruct users of CAHPS and SOPS products of their appropriate use. There are currently 20 different CAHPS Surveys, eight sets of supplemental items and four SOPS Surveys. Each survey set of supplemental items and all associated materials are available in Spanish. Each survey requires a mail and telephone version. Up to 10 new surveys may be developed over the next five years for which new administration materials will need to be developed (English and Spanish; mail and telephone versions as well). All existing surveys will be updated during this time frame. The contractor must also have experience in preparing this information for publication on the CAHPS website and in adapting materials to be 508 compliant.</p>
<p>Plan and execute meetings on issues related to patient safety and patient experience of care. This includes small meetings (12 to 15 participants; 8 per year) as well as large ones (500 or more participants; two of these in the five year contract period).</p>
<p>Develop and track the progress of up to 10 packages to OMB seeking approval for data collection.</p>
<p>Promote CAHPS and SOPS products. Products include surveys; user websites such as TalkingQuality.com; chart books based of CAHPS and SOPS data; electronic reports about all aspects of the project. This also includes working with staff from AHRQ's Office for Communication and Knowledge Transfer on dissemination plans; developing and updating an archive of CAHPS and SOPS presentations; developing up to 10 presentations per year for the grantees and AHRQ staff when necessary; developing and promoting up to 10 webinars and 20 podcast per year; research new means (through social media or other sources) of reaching potential users of CAHPS and SOPS products; identifying and developing responses to FAQs from users; identifying venues for promotion of CAHPS and SOPS products such as health quality-related professional meetings; attending such meetings and operating information booths with project-related materials; managing information booths in 20 locations per year.</p>
<p>Perform technical tasks such as literature reviews; collection of cognitive testing data; collection of focus group data; interviews with researchers, stakeholders and others on issues related to collection of CAHPS and SOPS data.</p>
<p>Manage all within-project communications. This includes developing and maintaining an intranet for team members; preparing quick turn-around notes for five or more weekly conference calls and occasional in-person meetings. The ability to develop and post these accurate call notes quickly and efficiently requires thorough understanding of: issues related to survey development; preparation of "report cards" based on patient experience data; and use of health quality data for quality improvement purposes in a number of settings (e.g., hospitals, doctor's offices, nursing homes and many others).</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance: 5 Years from Award date</p>
<p>Other important considerations</p>
<p>Additional capabilities that offerors must possess include:</p>
<p>Ability to adapt rapidly to changing needs and agendas. Sometimes an urgent and unanticipated need for a certain type of product (survey, quality improvement plan or reporting resource) asserts itself. In such cases, the offeror must be prepared to rearrange resources and the schedule to accommodate these changes.</p>
<p>Experience with and ability to manage large-scale collaborations among professionals who have different kinds of expertise and who work in various locations across the country.</p>
<p>Knowledge of and experience working with key organizations related to patient safety and patient experience surveys, including but not limited to: government organizations such as AHRQ, CMS and HRSA; accreditation and quality organizations such as NCQA, NQF, and JCAHP; consumer organizations such as AARP and the Disclosure Project; state Medicaid organizations; health care professional organizations (AMA, AHA, ANA, etc.); and others.</p>
<p>Also, potential offerors must show that they have all the capabilities in-house to perform the work described in this document, or that they have assembled a team which adds whatever expertise is necessary to perform the work.</p>
<p>Capability statement / information sought</p>

<SUBJECT>Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS)
<SOLNBR>RFI-WNS-JTCTRS
<RESPDATE>112211
<CONTACT>Thomas D. Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, Phone (937) 255-2666, Fax (937) 656-7538, Email Thomas.Sharkey@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Request for Information and Sources Sought<br />Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System</strong> <br /><br />This is a request for information, issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources with the capability to accomplish the effort described herein. The ASC/WNS (Simulators Division) will be competing the Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) with deliveries beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2013. Our primary interface with industry will be the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (https://www.fbo.gov/) site. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for industry comment in early calendar year (CY) 2012 and expect contract award in late 2012 or early 2013. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil.<br /><br />This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI, but is in need of information on potential sources for a system in support of the Combat Air Forces' (CAF), Special Operations Commands' (SOCOM), and Air Force Special Operations Commands' (AFSOC) Tactical Air Control Party and Combat Controllers in performance of Terminal Control, Terminal Guidance, Close Air Support and Joint Fires operations. The potential exists for the future contract to also provide systems to support the Marine Corp ANGLICO's, US Army Forward Observers / Joint Fires Observers and various units throughout SOCOM. This RFI is intended to help the government formulate the acquisition strategy and schedule. <br /><br />JTC TRS is an OSD derived program designed to fulfill an immediate need for realistic training and mission rehearsal for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC), Joint Fires Support, and Air Traffic Control in a simulated and controlled environment. The anticipated system(s) will be used to train basic procedures in the schoolhouse environment as well as mission rehearsal in large scale exercises. Mission rehearsal capabilities to practice, validate, and verify Joint Doctrine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are essential. This training capability provides direct support to Overseas Contingency and Combat Operations. Both manual real time control and automated simulation of airborne assets is required. Multiple configurations of the basic training system are anticipated which include a fixed version and a portable version suitable for forward deployment and/or ship board operations. The fixed-platform version will be configurable to suit student groups in a school house environment, team training and individual mission rehearsal. Instructor Operator Station(s), robust simulated threat environment, simulated natural environment, and Brief/Debrief Systems are all required subsystems. The military services are investing heavily in high fidelity, globally networked, combat mission simulations to provide training in virtual environments that approach live operations. All services are stressing interoperability as a basic requirement. By the time JTC TRS is expected to be fielded, many air-to-ground platforms will have simulators that are fully network interoperable. <br /><br />This requirement drives visual simulation requirements, geographically accurate visual databases, high fidelity representations of weapons systems that interact with JTACs, and high fidelity simulation of weapons effects. Each JTAC site will connect into the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON) as well as other service and joint networks. This will require the JTC TRS to comply with CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com/) and follow the guidelines of CJCSI 6212.01C. An associate contract agreement with the DMON network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of distributed mission integration.<br /><br />The JTC TRS acquisition strategy was planned to be "build-to-print" based on a Production Representative Article (PRA); however, the PRA does not meet all of the requirements of the Government Performance Specification (PSpec). The Government intends to set aside a period of the contract period of performance for the development and test of an engineering development model before a Milestone C production decision is made.<br /><br />Detailed performance requirements can be found in the attached notional PSpec. Please note that this attachment may be updated. The Government anticipates scheduling both industry days and engineering development model demonstration days prior to RFP release. The USAF has a requirement for at least 55 systems to be delivered beginning in FY13 through FY19. The Government anticipates a contractor logistics support concept for the CAF. All systems will be housed in Government facilities. Government-contracted instructor/operators will support assets acquired for SOCOM/AFSOC under a separate contract. <br /><br />In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:<br /><br />1. A description of your company, including address, CAGE Code, DUNS and Point of Contact information and your intentions for competing for this award.<br /><br />2. A description of your company's experience in developing and deploying high fidelity training devices and simulations for combat training, including a description of your experience in networking simulators and working with interoperability mechanisms such as Distributed Interactive Simulation and High Level Architecture protocols<br /><br />3. A description of your capability to develop, produce, test, and support a training system that meets the basic requirements described in the attached draft Government PSpec. Include information about your software development, manufacturing and production capabilities (including any ISO, CMMI or other certifications that you have achieved), as well as any subcontractor/teaming relationships that might pertain to this effort.<br /><br />4. Provide an estimate of the length of time that your company would require to either complete the PRA development or provide your own solution that would meet the requirements of the PSpec. Address any risks that you foresee in completing the limited development using the PRA versus proposing your own solution.<br /><br />5. A description of your company's capabilities and experiences in the worldwide deployment and support of complex training systems. Assuming a contract award in the 1st quarter of CY13, how soon could your company deliver an operational trainer to a CONUS/OCONUS location, and how many systems per year can your company deploy?<br /><br />6. A description of your company's experience integrating disparate simulation software and hardware into an immersive mission training system with emulated equipment.<br /><br />7. Identification of the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of this scope.<br /><br />8. Comments to the attached Government performance specification. The Government is especially interested in the technology challenges each offeror sees in the draft performance description, as well as any areas where the PSpec does not provide sufficient detail for any requirement that would allow a JTAC to complete a training activity or mission rehearsal. Your inputs will be evaluated to determine if changes are required to the performance spec.<br /><br />9. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy.<br /><br />10. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 541512, with a size standard of $23M. Indicate whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS 541512 and if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.).<br /><br />Technical questions may be directed to Kenneth Millard, Program Manager at 937-255-4786, email: kenneth.millard@wpafb.af.mil. Contractual questions may be directed to Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to: ASC/WNSK (Attn: Tom Sharkey) 2300 D Street, Bldg 32 Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7249 e-mail: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. FAX: (937) 656-7538.<br /><br />Responses are requested no later than close of business on 22 Nov 11. Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages, excluding comments to the draft Government PSpec. A point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations that might be needed with regard to the information provided. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NNA12EDM001LThis RFI is a market survey for information to be used for planning purposes only.  Thepurpose of this RFI is to obtain information from industry on potential systems,processes, and products that will achieve calcium compounds removal from concentratedurine to below solubility limitNASA intends to lease or procure Electrodialysis Metathesis System for water recoverysystem on board of International Space Station (ISS).  One of the objectives of this work plan is to evaluate the electro dialysis metathesis(EDM) process for the removal of calcium scale precursors from urine. Operation of theInternational Space Station (ISS) urine processor assembly (UPA) has demonstrated thatcalcium scale can be a limiting factor to achieving high water recovery ratios.  Theurine generated on ISS has a high potential for calcium scale formation due tomicrogravity initiated bone loss from astronauts and the use of sulfuric acid as apretreatment.  As a result, the ISS UPA has operated at reduced water recovery ratio inorder to prevent the precipitation of calcium scale.  Example of scale forming calciumsalts: calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate. The need to resupply water to ISS can beaddressed by mitigating this calcium scale problem and increasing the water recoveryratio of the UPA. This can be accomplished by removing the calcium and its ionicconjugates from solution. The EDM process may be developed as a method to remove calciumfrom solution and prevent its precipitation as calcium scale.  The development of thistechnology also allows for the development of a new generation of spacecraft wastewatertreatment systems which are designed specifically to deal with precipitated scale formingsolids.This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subjectto FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for PlanningPurposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it is not to be construedas a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government payfor the information submitted in response to this request.  This procurement is subjectto review or cancellation at any time.	The NAICS code planned for this procurement is 423490; the small business size standardis 500 employees. The schedule, method of solicitation, type of contract, set asidepotential, selection criteria, pricing structure, and other considerations to be usedwill depend on the NASAs analysis of the responses received from this RFI.NASA is presently familiar with the capabilities of Veolia zero discharge desalination(ZDD) systems and seeks this or equivalent equipment to fulfill this need.We request industry experts to provide any information, solutions, or product offeringthat will meet our requirements.  System Characteristics:The system may incorporate an electro dialysis cell consisting of multiple compartments.Following is an example of possible system configuration that NASA seeks. The electrodialysis-metathesis cell module may have a capacity of individually-placed ionexchange membranes: 3 cation exchange membranes and 2 anion exchange membranes. The cellmodule should have 2 electrodes: anode and cathode. The 2 cation exchange membranesshould be placed in a vicinity of electrodes. The assembly should allow easy membranereplacement with a possibility of replacement of electrodes to test various membranes andelectrodes. The room between membranes should have optimized spacers, also with apossibility of easy spacer replacement. The stack assembly should have seals that providepositive sealing. Each membrane compartment shall have inlet and outlet ports forprocessed liquids: two compartments for rinsing of electrodes, one compartment for feedstream, one compartment for replacement ions solution (for example, NaCl), twocompartments for processed liquids consisting exchanged ions. The total number ofcompartments in this example: 6. The compartments will consist spacers that facilitateliquid flow and separate ion exchange membranes.The proposed configuration may be a square or rectangular stack, tubular or other compactgeometry. The materials selection: the materials should be compatible with the product of highlyconcentrated salt solutions and acidic (pH2) conditions. The product stream is highlyconcentrated urine at about 80% of water removal level. Other streams would haveparameters as used in metathesis.The active cross section areas of electrodes and ion exchange membranes should providesystem capacity of approximately 5 L per hour. The anion and cation exchange membrane life span should be approximately the same underoperational conditions.Operational:No water splitting (gas release) should occur. No excessive temperatures are allowed(operation at ambient temperature; need for external cooling shall be avoided).Optimized  (minimal) power use is desirable.System should be able to handle particles in the processed liquids (design ofcompartments, spacers and ports).We are looking for all pertinent information including rough order of magnitude forpricing, product lead time for delivery, and any information believed to be helpful inour market research and in determining industry capabilities.  Desired lead time fordelivery is 60 days after award of any contract or order.Responses to this RFI must include the minimum following information:  Company name,address, contractual and technical points of contact, phone number, e-mail, and website(if applicable), number of years in business, and name of parent company if applicable. Also required is information about the vendors business size (i.e., large, small, smalldisadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran owned, etc.) ,whether the firm is under a GSA Schedule Contract for this product, and which industriesdoes the vendor identify itself with in the North American Industry Classification System(NAICS).  Detailed requirements for the acquisition have not been finalized, nor have the specificsfor the acquisition strategy been determined.  NASA intends to use the results of itsmarket research to aid in the making of these final decisions.	The objectives of thisRFI are: to provide industry with preliminary information regarding this potentialacquisition, solicit information about potential sources and ROM pricing estimates, toidentify the capabilities of small business and other business classifications to performthe work, to invite potential offerors to submit comments regarding the fulfillment ofthis requirement.Responses to this RFI are due by 4:30 PM Pacific Time on Tuesday, November 22, 2011. Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements, suggestions,schedule/ price ROM estimates, as well as any comments on the acquisition approach(email only) to: Elizabeth A. Baierl, Email:  elizabeth.a.baierl@nasa.gov.  Responses arelimited to twenty (20) pages in length, not including cover letter, cover page, and tableof contents.  Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Officesoftware applications.Following this initial feedback, NASA may conduct one-on-one meetings with potentialcontractors.  These meetings will allow for exchange of information and will provide anopportunity for potential offerors to provide feedback on the Governments requirementsand its acquisition approach.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Internet site for therelease of any future information about this acquisition. Potential offerors will beresponsible for downloading their own copy of any future documents.  Information will beposted on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browserapplication.

<DESC>The FAA Technical Training Office (AJL) has an immediate need to obtain software and associated technical support services to implement and execute a Learning Content Management System (LCMS) that will be deployed enterprise-wide in the FAA.  The LCMS will include functions to support the design, development, and evaluation of training for FAA ATCs and technicians today and in the future, as NextGen is implemented.  As our National Aviation System transforms to meet the demands of a new century of aviation, AJL has to ensure that our training workforce, ATCs, and technicians have the right tools and technology for training, to meet these demands.
This is an extremely important initiative to our organization and will serve as a benefit to the Agency.  The LCMS will become the foundation of a shared training development environment that provides productivity efficiencies and cost savings in the development and lifecycle management of training programs and supporting materials for the FAA.

<DESC>Small Clinical Trials to Test Feasibility and Specific Target Engagement of Novel Pharmacological Treatments in Mood and Anxiety Disorders (FAST-MA)
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to perform the project requirements stated below.</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the government plan their acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research. The Government will not entertain questions regarding this market research.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of three Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notices that were published for small clinical trials to test feasibility and specific target engagement of novel pharmacological treatments. Each SBSS notice is for treatments of a different group of disorders. If the interested small business has capability with more than one group of disorders, it is not necessary to provide more than one capability statement/response. It is recommended however, that the capabilities with the other group(s) of disorders be referenced within the capability statement submitted.</p>
<p>Background.</p>
<p>Mood and Anxiety disorders are among the most common and serious disorders treated by mental health practitioners. According to the 2005 National Comorbidity Survey-Replication study [Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Walters EE. Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of twelve-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Archives of General Psychiatry, 2005 Jun;62(6):617-27.], the prevalence estimate is that about 26% of the U.S. adult population is affected by mental disorders. About 9.5% of the populations ages 18 and older suffer from mood disorders. These include major depressive disorder; dysthymic disorder (a chronic, mild depression); and bipolar disorder (also called manic depression). Major depressive disorder is, by itself, the leading cause of disability among Americans age 15 - 44, according to the World Health Organization. For Anxiety Disorders, the prevalence was about 18% of U.S. adult population. There are a wide variety of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and special phobias. While there are many pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and combination treatment options available to clinicians, many patients with mood and anxiety disorders respond poorly to the currently available therapies.</p>
<p>Because of the substantial mortality and morbidity associated with inadequate treatment, serious mental illness is a major public health problem. The scope of this problem is vast both in terms of the numbers of affected individuals and the resultant societal and economic burden.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in basic science and in the understanding of complex illnesses offer promising new opportunities for researchers to pursue and offer new hope for those living with mental illnesses. Now is a critical time to take advantage of new breakthroughs and tools. But the paths for treatment discoveries are not clearly marked. Despite the tremendous advances in basic neuroscience and behavioral science that drive our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mental disorders, there is a dearth of new therapeutics in the discovery pipeline. [See From Discovery to Cure: Accelerating the development of new and personalized interventions for mental illnesses. Report of the National Advisory Mental Health Council's Workgroup (2010). http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/reports/fromdiscoverytocure.pdf]</p>
<p>The high cost of developing novel drugs, the high attrition rate of candidate therapeutics during development and clinical testing, and adverse effects contribute to the high rate of failure of new compounds in clinical trials. [Munos B. 2009. Lessons from 60 years of pharmaceutical innovation. Nature Reviews 8:959-968.] In 2009, the number of novel drugs approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all disease areas continued to remain low, with only 19 new molecular entities approved. [Hughes B. 2010. 2009 FDA drug approvals. Nature Reviews 9:89-92]</p>
<p>At this point, the success rates for Phase II projects are the lowest for any phase in the discovery pipeline. The success rates for Phase II projects have fallen from 28% (2006-2007) to 18% (2008-2009) [Arrrowsmith J. Phase II failures: 2008-2010. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 1 (2011)]. In contrast, the success rate for Phase III trials is much higher, around 50% [Arrrowsmith J. Phase III and submission failures: 2007-2010. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 87 (2011)]</p>
<p>Phase II clinical trials that are well designed and well conducted can provide the data required to determine whether to proceed with a drug candidate into Phase III trials. Paul et al have described the need for a new paradigm for drug development based on "fast fail", i.e., focusing on proof of concept prior to proceeding to expensive Phase 3 trials. [Paul, SM, Mytelka, DS, Dunwiddie, CT, et al, How to improve R&amp;D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 9, 203-214 (2010)]. This paradigm calls for small, deep trials, focused on proof of concept "experimental medicine" trials, to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy. Experimental medicine moves into human studies quickly with biomarkers, including imaging, to demonstrate biological effects. These types of small proof of concept trials could help de-risking a new compound or demonstrating a "fast fail" for a new target.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.</p>
<p>This initiative seeks to expeditiously test new compounds for mood and anxiety disorders, including depression, affective spectrum conditions, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorders, and other psychiatric conditions. The outcome of this initiative is also expected to lead to enhanced understanding of specific target engagement by such compounds and development of innovative treatment approaches for mood and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>The specific aims of this initiative are:</p>
<p>&bull; To expeditiously perform randomized clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy of such promising interventions in a well-characterized cohort of adult patients diagnosed with mood and anxiety disorders.<br />&bull; At a minimum, each clinical trial shall be an adequately controlled study in patients with mood and anxiety disorders.<br />&bull; Depending on pilot data available for interventions selected for testing, each trial may be a single-site or multisite study with a number of subjects adequate to address the primary hypotheses with a minimum power of 0.80. Sufficient patients should be enrolled in each study to establish proof of concept and/or inform a judgment whether the particular intervention warrants more extensive evaluation in larger clinical trials.<br />&bull; To establish a small group of clinical trials sites that will focus on identifying and testing promising pharmacological interventions for the treatment of Mood and Anxiety Disorders.<br />&bull; To further study and evaluate interventions that showed efficacy in a previous proof of concept (POC) clinical trial under the FAST-MA in larger clinical trials.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>NIMH anticipates that collaboration between multiple scientific investigators and organizations will be required. The specific experience, ability, and capabilities necessary to perform this work include (but are not limited to) the five (5) items below:</p>
<p>1) Experience in performing clinical trials of pharmacological interventions in mood and anxiety disorders specifically, including appropriate control groups;</p>
<p>2) Ability to recruit significant numbers of subjects with mood and anxiety disorders from multiple representative sites, and the ability to retain and follow up subjects in an ongoing clinical trial;</p>
<p>3) The capability to include appropriate measures to gauge target engagement and serve as biomarkers (e.g., imaging, EEG, ERP, pre-pulse inhibition, PET, clinical);</p>
<p>4) The capability to provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with mood and anxiety disorders;</p>
<p>5) Experience collaborating with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, advocates, and consumers) in mood and anxiety disorders research.</p>

<p>Background.</p>
<p>The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are more common in the pediatric population than are some better known disorders such as diabetes, spinal bifida, or Down syndrome [Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT, Cook Jr. EH, Dawson G, Gordon B, Gravel JS, Johnson CP, Kellen RJ, Levy SE, Minshew NJ, Prizant BM, Rapin I, Rogers SJ, Stone WL, Teplin S, Tuchman RF, Volkmar FR. The screening and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 1999; 29(2): 439-484.] A study of a U.S. metropolitan area estimated that 3.4 of every 1,000 children 3-10 years old had autism [Yeargin-Allsopp M, Rice C, Karapurkar T, Doernberg N, Boyle C, Murphy C. Prevalence of Autism in a US Metropolitan Area. The Journal of the American Medical Association. 2003 Jan 1;289(1):49-55]. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network (http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm.html) found that 1 in every 110 eight-year old children were diagnosable for an ASD. ASD range in severity, with autism being the most debilitating form while other disorders, such as Asperger syndrome, produce milder symptoms. There is currently no a pharmacological cure for ASDs, although many of the dysfunctional, coinciding behaviors may be treated pharmacologically, although there is no single best treatment package for all children with ASD.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in basic science and in the understanding of complex illnesses offer promising new opportunities for researchers to pursue and offer new hope for those living with mental illnesses. Now is a critical time to take advantage of new breakthroughs and tools. But the paths for treatment discoveries are not clearly marked.

<DESC>Small Clinical Trials to Test Feasibility and Specific Target Engagement of Novel Pharmacological Treatments in Psychotic Spectrum Disorders (FAST-PS)
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to perform the project requirements stated below.</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the government plan their acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research. The Government will not entertain questions regarding this market research.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of three Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notices that were published for small clinical trials to test feasibility and specific target engagement of novel pharmacological treatments. Each SBSS notice is for treatments of a different group of disorders. If the interested small business has capability with more than one group of disorders, it is not necessary to provide more than one capability statement/response. It is recommended however, that the capabilities with the other group(s) of disorders be referenced within the capability statement submitted.</p>
<p>Background.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling mental disorder characterized by deficits in thought processes, perceptions, and emotional responsiveness. According to the 2005 National Comorbidity Survey-Replication study [Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Walters EE. Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of twelve-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Archives of General Psychiatry, 2005 Jun;62(6):617-27.], the prevalence estimate is that about 26% of the U.S. adult population is affected by mental disorders. About 1.1% of the populations ages 18 and older suffer from schizophrenia. These include schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. While there are many pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and combination treatment options available to clinicians, many patients with psychotic spectrum disorders respond poorly to the currently available therapies.</p>
<p>Because of the substantial mortality and morbidity associated with inadequate treatment, serious mental illness is a major public health problem. The scope of this problem is vast both in terms of the numbers of affected individuals and the resultant societal and economic burden.</p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs in basic science and in the understanding of complex illnesses offer promising new opportunities for researchers to pursue and offer new hope for those living with mental illnesses. Now is a critical time to take advantage of new breakthroughs and tools. But the paths for treatment discoveries are not clearly marked. Despite the tremendous advances in basic neuroscience and behavioral science that drive our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mental disorders, there is a dearth of new therapeutics in the discovery pipeline. [See From Discovery to Cure: Accelerating the development of new and personalized interventions for mental illnesses. Report of the National Advisory Mental Health Council's Workgroup (2010). http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/reports/fromdiscoverytocure.PSf]</p>
<p>The high cost of developing novel drugs, the high attrition rate of candidate therapeutics during development and clinical testing, and adverse effects contribute to the high rate of failure of new compounds in clinical trials. [Munos B. 2009. Lessons from 60 years of pharmaceutical innovation. Nature Reviews 8:959-968.] In 2009, the number of novel drugs approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all disease areas continued to remain low, with only 19 new molecular entities approved. [Hughes B. 2010. 2009 FDA drug approvals. Nature Reviews 9:89-92]</p>
<p>At this point, the success rates for Phase II projects are the lowest for any phase in the discovery pipeline. The success rates for Phase II projects have fallen from 28% (2006-2007) to 18% (2008-2009) [Arrrowsmith J. Phase II failures: 2008-2010. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 1 (2011)]. In contrast, the success rate for Phase III trials is much higher, around 50% [Arrrowsmith J. Phase III and submission failures: 2007-2010. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 10, 87 (2011)]</p>
<p>Phase II clinical trials that are well designed and well conducted can provide the data required to determine whether to proceed with a drug candidate into Phase III trials. Paul et al have described the need for a new paradigm for drug development based on "fast fail", i.e., focusing on proof of concept prior to proceeding to expensive Phase 3 trials. [Paul, SM, Mytelka, DS, Dunwiddie, CT, et al, How to improve R&amp;D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 9, 203-214 (2010)]. This paradigm calls for small, deep trials, focused on proof of concept "experimental medicine" trials, to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy. Experimental medicine moves into human studies quickly with biomarkers, including imaging, to demonstrate biological effects. These types of small proof of concept trials could help de-risking a new compound or demonstrating a "fast fail" for a new target.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.</p>
<p>This initiative seeks to expeditiously test new compounds for psychotic spectrum disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The outcome of this initiative is also expected to lead to enhanced understanding of specific target engagement by such compounds and development of innovative treatment approaches for psychotic spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>The specific aims of this initiative are:</p>
<p>&bull; To expeditiously perform randomized clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy of such promising interventions in a well-characterized cohort of patients diagnosed with psychotic spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; At a minimum, each clinical trial shall be an adequately controlled study in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; Depending on pilot data available for interventions selected for testing, each trial may be a single-site or multisite study with a number of subjects adequate to address the primary hypotheses with a minimum power of 0.80. Sufficient patients should be enrolled in each study to establish proof of concept and/or inform a judgment whether the particular intervention warrants more extensive evaluation in larger clinical trials.<br />&bull; To establish a small group of clinical trials sites that will focus on identifying and testing promising pharmacological interventions for the treatment of psychotic spectrum disorders.<br />&bull; To further study and evaluate interventions that showed efficacy in a previous proof of concept (POC) clinical trial under the FAST-PS in larger clinical trials.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>NIMH anticipates that collaboration between multiple scientific investigators and organizations will be required. The specific experience, ability, and capabilities necessary to perform this work include (but are not limited to) the five (5) items below:</p>
<p>1) Experience in performing clinical trials of pharmacological interventions in psychotic spectrum disorders specifically, including appropriate control groups;</p>
<p>2) Ability to recruit significant numbers of subjects with psychotic spectrum disorders from multiple representative sites, and the ability to retain and follow up subjects in an ongoing clinical trial;</p>
<p>3) The capability to include appropriate measures to gauge target engagement and serve as biomarkers (e.g., imaging, EEG, ERP, pre-pulse inhibition, PET, clinical);</p>
<p>4) The capability to provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with psychotic spectrum disorders;</p>
<p>5) Experience collaborating with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, advocates, and consumers) in psychotic spectrum disorders research.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded research programs using rodents to model aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that may be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. A continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging.</p>
<p>In 2005, NIA awarded a nine year contract to develop and maintain a colony of genetically-defined aged Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats. Since contract initiation, the Contractor has acquired BN and F344 breeding stock, re-derived the stock and provided the NIA with documentation of the cesarean derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. The breeding and aging colonies have been developed and rats have been distributed to the research community as requested. Presently, the Contractor maintains a colony of approximately 22,000 rodents housed in two barriers.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to continue services that are currently being provided by the Harlan Laboratories under contract number HHSN260200500006C until the renewal contract colony is fully developed and all ages are available to the research community. Rats will be maintained and provided to the research community as requested until the animals are gone or the termination date of this contract is reached, whichever comes first. The analysis requested as part of this contract will assist the NIA in determining the appropriate level of animals to maintain. <br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The purposes of this acquisition are to provide an analysis of shipping patterns within contract number HHSN260200500006C and to continue the maintenance and distribution of a standing colony of aged, genetically defined BN and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats for use by investigators in studies of aging while the renewal contract colony is being developed. This colony must be maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where the animals are monitored and characterized for diseases status and markers of genetic purity. <br />The development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase takes approximately three (3) years. Animals are entered into the aging colony monthly so that there is a continuous supply available.</p>
<p>The NIA seeks to maintain the existing colony until the renewal contract colony has all ages available for the research community. In addition, the analysis of shipping patterns will assist the NIA in determining the appropriate level of animals to maintain.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Analyze shipping patterns and B) Maintain and distribute the standing colony of aged, genetically defined BN and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: A. Semiannual Progress Reports; B. Weekly Census Reports; C. Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports; D. Reports of the results of the semiannual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies; E. Postmortem Reports; and F. Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is three 12-month performance years from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2015.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 112990 ($0.75 million); and (2) The contractor must have a current supply of rodents in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For this reason, the existing colonly cannot be transferred.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT. <br />a. Capability Statement - Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with rodent care and development, as well as formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) provide any catalog/list prices for services described in this notice; (3) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code(s); and (4) any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the OPDIV's acquisition requirements.<br />b.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. <br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded research programs using rodents to model aging processes and age-related diseases of humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain animal models suitable for the study of biological and behavioral processes in aging. A continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging.
<p>In 2004, NIA awarded a nine year contract to develop and maintain a colony of genetically- defined calorically-restricted rat and mouse strains. Since contract initiation, the Contractor has acquired breeding stock for two inbred strains of mice and two inbred strains of rats, re-derived the stock and provided NIA with documentation of the cesarean derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. The breeding and aging colonies have been developed for one inbred mouse strain, one hybrid mouse strain, one inbred rat strain and one hybrid rat strain, and animals have been distributed to the research community as requested. Presently, the contractor maintains a colony of approximately 3,000 rodents housed in two barriers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to continue services that are currently being provided by the Charles River Laboratories under contract number HHSN260200400003C until the renewal contract colony is fully developed and all ages are available to the research community. Breeding in contract number HHSN260200400003C will cease when the renewal contract colony begins entering into the aging colony, but the aging colony in contract number HHSN260200400003C will be maintained and provided to the research community as requested until the animals are gone or the termination date of this contract is reached, whichever comes first. In addition, the analysis of shipping patterns will provide valuable information to the NIA for managing this resource and the cryopreservation of embryos from the rat strains will ensure a future source for stock for new contracts. This has become an imperative due to the difficulties encountered in obtaining stock for this contract.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this acquisition is to: A) cryopreserve embryos from the rat strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C; B) provide an analysis of shipping patterns within contract number HHSN260200400003C; and C) continue the maintenance and distribution of the standing colony of aged, genetically-defined calorically-restricted rat and mouse strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C for use by investigators in studies of aging, while the renewal contract colony is being developed. This colony must be maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where the animals are monitored and characterized for diseases status and markers of genetic purity. <br /><br />The development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase takes approximately three (3) years. Animals are entered into the aging colony monthly so that there is a continuous supply available.</p>
<p>The NIA seeks to maintain the existing colony until the renewal contract colony has all ages available for the research community. In addition, the analysis provided in B) above will assist the NIA in determining the proper level of caloric restricted animals to maintain. Cryopreservation of embryos provided in part A) above will ensure that there is a continuing source of stock for future contracts. <br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:&nbsp; The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Breeding Colony Development; B)Breeding Colony Maintenance; C) Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D) Feeding Protocol; E) Environmental Requirements; F) Colony Evaluation and Monitoring; and G) Shipment of Animals to Investigators.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: A. Semiannual Progress Reports; B. Weekly Census Reports; C. Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports; D. Reports of the results of the semiannual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies; E. Postmortem Reports; and F. Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is four 12-month performance years from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2016.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 122990 ($0.75 Million); and (2) The contractor must have a current supply of rodents in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For this reason, the existing colonly cannot be transferred.</p>

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

The Office of Human Resources and Administration (OHR&A), Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI), in accordance with the Executive Order 13548, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Management Directive (MD) 715, is seeking potential contractor sources to provide pre-screened candidates who have targeted disabilities and are eligible for VA employment opportunities.  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires Federal agencies to hire, promote, and retain qualified individuals with disabilities.

The targeted disabilities are:

"	Epilepsy
"	Intellectual disabilities
"	Psychiatric disorders
"	Dwarfism

The contractor would conduct specialized recruitment efforts requested by VA, and shall identify and maintain a list of candidates with targeted disabilities who are qualified for VA employment.

Currently, VA and members of the public can obtain information regarding the hiring of the disabled through: 
"	VA - VOCATIONAL  REHABILITATION  &  EMPLOYMENT  SERVICE      http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/vre/
"	DoL - Workforce Recruitment Program      http://www.dol.gov/odep/topics/WorkforceRecruitmentProgram.htm
"	ED - State Vocational Rehabilitation; each state has an office to support recruitment of people with disabilities     http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/vrpractices/busdev.html

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is conducting market research for the modernization of the John W. Keys III Pump Generating Plant (Keys PGP). The Keys PGP is one of the few large pump generation facilities in the western United States that has potential pump storage/wind integration capacity, but this will require much rehabilitation and improvement to the existing facility. The Keys PGP consists of six pumping units and six pump/generating (PG) units. The six pumping units (P1-P6) are each rated at 65,000 horsepower (hp).  PG units 7 and 8 are each rated at 67,500 hp in the pump mode and 50,000 kilowatts (kW) in the generating mode.  PG units 9 through 12 are each rated at 70,000 hp in the pump mode and 53,500 kW in the generating mode. Upgrades are planned for the governors, exciters, protective relays, and controls for all the units.
The intent of this notice is to announce the availability of the "John W. Keys III Pump-Generating Plant Modernization Project Market Research Questionnaire 1" to interested potential offerors.  Reclamation is conducting market research to determine the level of interest in the electric power industry in potential contract business arrangements for the planned upgrades.  Interested prime contractors and subcontractors are invited to complete the Questionnaire.  Participation is voluntary and respondents will not be compensated for their participation.  The identity of respondents will not be revealed outside the Contracting Officer's staff.  A contract will not result directly from this market research and there may be future market research or acquisition planning announcements made regarding the Keys PGP Modernization.   
Background information on the Keyes PGP Modernization, the planned activities, and the Questionnaire itself will be available on or about November 10, 2011, in Adobe Acrobat PDF at  http://www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/index.html. Completed Questionnaires will be accepted for a 45-day period beginning on the date the questionnaire is posted to the website. All responses must be accompanied by a completed Questionnaire.  Any responses not accompanied by a completed Questionnaire will not be considered.  The intent of Questionnaire No. 1 is to seek input on certain potential contracting arrangements for the upgrades to the governors, exciters, protective relays, and control equipment and to determine the level of interest among small businesses.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be sent to the PGPModernization@usbr.gov email address or mailed to the Contracting Officer's attention.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE:
<p>This notice announces a U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) Industry Day to be held on December 13, 2011 at the El Paso Service Processing Center located at: 8915 Montana Ave, El Paso, Texas 79925. The Industry Day will be held on the second floor of the building starting at 8:30 am and will last until approximately 12:00 pm.</p>
<p>All business sizes are welcome to participate; however, ICE is trying to determine small business interest. All information received in response to this notice will be used to determine the appropriateness of any small business set-aside for this requirement.</p>
<p>Requirement: Transportation</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a continuing need for transportation services to provide, operate, and manage the transportation of detainees in ICE custody for the El Paso Field Office Area of Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612.</p>
<p>Due to ICE requirements for flexibility in using Contractor personnel to conduct transportation as well as to support custody and escort operations, ICE has chosen to utilize the title of "Detention Officer" (DO) to refer to Contractor driver/armed guard personnel. This position reflects those responsibilities unrelated to transportation but which are required for the Contractor to effectively support the ICE mission.</p>
<p>DO duties include but are not limited to armed transportation services, escorting detainees to and from transport vehicles, monitoring detainees in custody, and conducting limited pat-downs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish these services including management staff, supervision, manpower, relief officers, uniforms, equipment and supplies (including transport vehicles, firearms, body restraints, non-lethal devices, body armor, cellular telephones and radios) to provide transportation services for the most part during the week days. Seven routes have been identified as several times daily five days a week. Staff shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day to ensure the routes in ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) El Paso are performed at the appropriate frequency. The Contractor shall assign at a minimum per vehicle, two person teams of armed DOs and provide a minimum of one (1) DO of the same gender of the detainee(s) being transported.</p>
<p>Contractor DOs shall not be tied to specific routes within the contract. DOs may be used to provide transportation and guard services as needed as consistent with the job description above. However, DOs will have to have specific locations as their home-base which will determine their prevailing wage determination.</p>
<p>The estimated number of detainees to be transported may vary day to day. It will be the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the detainees are transported in the most safe and economical manner.</p>
<p>An advanced list of routes and frequencies will be provided to those attending the Industry Day. If you are not able to attend, the routes and frequencies will be provided in the RFP. The current estimate is that there are 72 routes in the El Paso AOR listed as daily (21), week days (42) and as needed (9). Based on the estimated number of detainees per trip, it will be up to the Contractor to provide the appropriate transport vehicle (bus, van, and/or sedan).</p>
<p>Required Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>Business Permits and Licenses</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor is responsible to obtain all business permits and licenses prior to performance of the contract.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall (depending on the state's requirements) be licensed as a quality security company in accordance with the requirements of the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; Throughout the term of this contract, the Contractor shall maintain currency of ALL permits/business licenses and make them available for government inspection. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws and all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.<br />- Firearms Requirements<br />- Body Armor Requirements</p>
<p>Licensing of Employees<br />&bull; Before the commencement of services under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure each employee has the appropriate registration, commissions, permits and licenses as required by the District, Municipality, County and State in which the ICE work site(s) is/are located.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall verify all licenses and certifications. If applicable, Contractor staff shall posses a current license/registration for the state(s) in which they are performing.</p>
<p>Standards and Policies</p>
<p>ICE requires that the Contractor comply with all required Standards and Policies. These include but are not limited to:<br />&bull; American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Detention Facilities (most current edition) and the most recent copy of the supplement issued every two years. A copy is attainable through the following website: www.aca.org/bookstore/view.asp. <br />&bull; The DHS / ICE 2008 Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) - A copy is attainable through the following website: http://www.ice.gov/detention-standards/2008/. <br />&bull; All rules and regulations governing public buildings and grounds.</p>
<p>Personnel Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Background Investigations and Suitability Screenings will be conducted on all Contract Employees by the Office of Professional Responsibility and Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU).<br />&bull; The Contractor shall agree that each employee working on this contract will successfully pass the DHS Employment Eligibility Verification (E-Verify) program operated by USCIS to establish work authorization and U.S. Citizenship.<br />&bull; Employees must reside in the United States.</p>
<p>Training requirements will include but are not limited to the following:<br />&bull; General Training Requirements - Basic Transportation Subjects<br />&bull; Refresher Training<br />&bull; Critical Training Subjects - Basic First Aid and CPR Training<br />&bull; On the Job Training<br />&bull; Supervisory Training<br />&bull; Proficiency Testing<br />&bull; Certified Instructors<br />&bull; Training Documents</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUPERFUND CONTRACTS 2010 PHASE II - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED<br /><br /></strong>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather industry comments and/or suggestions on improving the Superfund Contracts 2010 Acquisition Strategy, Phase II. This request differs from EPA's February 16, 2010 RFI in that the information collected in 2010 was considered in the development of the initial Phase I of Contracts 2010. <br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br /><br />The Superfund Contracts 2010 acquisition strategy is being led by a cross-agency workgroup consisting of representatives from EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP), Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) and the EPA Regions. The overall mission of the workgroup is to develop an acquisition strategy and implementation plan for the Superfund program while executing the best procurement practices for all of the Superfund national classes of contracts. Phase II of Contracts 2010 Superfund Acquisition strategy also seeks to address government-wide contracting initiatives.<br /><br />The goals of the Contracts 2010 strategy are to: <br />(1) Balance national consistency with local flexibility; <br />(2) Ensure that there is appropriate competition in the contracting process; <br />(3) Increase participation of all socio-economic concerns in the Superfund contracting program; <br />(4) Implement Green procurements/policies and procedures; <br />(5) Identify and implement opportunities and initiatives for process and cost efficiencies; <br />(6) Identify the full range of vehicles or instruments available for obtaining services for the Superfund cleanup programs; and <br />(7) Mitigate high risk contracting practices.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong><br /><br />1. What can EPA do to encourage contractors to hire locally, both sub-contractors and employees, for requirements at Superfund locations?<br />2. What can EPA do to encourage contractors to provide more sub-contracting opportunities to socio-economic business concerns (i.e. Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) SB, Woman-Owned SB, Historically Underutilized SB, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB)? <br />3. What specific incentives or disincentives would be effective towards achieving sub-contracting goals to socio-economic business concerns?<br />4. What are the resource benefits and disadvantages of the current methods of Superfund contracting?<br />5. Are there any activities or reporting requirements currently being performed on Superfund contracts that may no longer be needed?<br />6. What are some of the barriers that your firm has encountered when proposing on or being awarded Superfund contracts?<br />7. What methods or approaches can you suggest that EPA take to meet the goals of the Contracts 2010 strategy?<br /><br /><strong>WHAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI<br /></strong><br />Responders to this RFI are asked to provide comments and/or suggestions on how the EPA can achieve the existing Contracts 2010 goals and to the questions posed above. Please limit your responses to five (5) single sided typed pages or less. Information should be as succinct as possible.<br /><br /><strong>FOLLOW-UP SESSIONS</strong><br /><br />As a result of the analysis of the responses to this RFI, the EPA may request individual contractors to meet with Agency representatives in Washington, DC or Regional Headquarters offices to further evaluate and discuss submittals, comments and/or suggestions to this RFI. This meeting is optional and is not required of any contractors that choose to submit a response to this RFI.<br /><br /><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br /><br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.209(c), responses to the RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The EPA will not award a contract based on this RFI. Responses will be treated as "Information Only" and will not be returned.<br /><br /><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION</strong><br /><br />Please submit your response to this RFI via e-mail to: Christopher Nolte at nolte.christopher@epa.gov and Jeanne Poovey at poovey.jeanne@epa.gov by close of business on Friday, December 2, 2011.<br /><br /><strong>E-MAIL SUBMISSIONS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY</span> PLEASE.<br /><br />NAICS: </strong>This RFI is not restricted to NAICS 541620. Vendors that operate under other NAICS codes which support Superfund clean up and enforcement are encouraged to respond.</p>

<DESC>The Louis Stokes VA Medical Center (LSVAMC), 10701 E. Blvd Cleveland, OH 44106, intends to procure for the Cardiology Department via sole source for (24) catheter kits dragon fly style.  The Cardiology Department believes that this requirement can only be provided by ST. Jude Medical.   The C7 Dragonfly catheter provides unprecedented magnification and detail in intravascular imaging. Using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), the C7 Dragonfly emits near-infrared light for a data sampling rate of 100 MB per second to produce real-time, ultra-high definition images. Combined with the ILUMIEN or C7-XR OCT intravascular imaging systems, the C7 Dragonfly offers a new standard for lesion assessment, classification and diagnosis.
  The catheter required must be capable of the following: 
A.	Non-occlusive flush action eliminates the need for occlusion balloon 
B.	Extreme Resolution imaging based on OCT technology 
C.	Low-profile mini rail tip for fast placement 
D.	Hydrophilic coating reduces drag 
E.	Dual marker bands for precise positioning 
F.	Compatible with standard 0.014" steerable guide wires 
G.	Imaging speed up to 25 mm per second 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334510 - Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing. Small Business size Standard is 500 Employees.  This announcement of the intent to sole source is NOT a request for proposals, quotes, or bids.  No formal solicitation document will be forthcoming.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit product information in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is entirely in the discretion of the Govt.  Inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be emailed to the POC at Kevin.Conwell@va.gov by November 17th, 2011 at 1PM EST.

The following addenda have been attached to this provision: NONE.  <br><br>(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this acquisition.  The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical, Past Performance and Price.  <br><br>The Technical element of the evaluation will be a determination as to whether the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications in the solicitation. In addition, the technical element of the evaluation will be based upon how much light sensitivity the offered camera provides, with more light sensitivity being more valuable to the Government's mission.  The Government reserves the right to select an offer that provides the best value with respect to light sensitivity versus price. The Technical element of the evaluation shall be based solely on information furnished by the vendor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the Government to determine whether the product meets the performance characteristics and specifications of the requirement.  If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to conform to the requirement of this solicitation, the offeror shall include a clear description of such proposed modifications and clearly mark any descriptive materials to show modifications.  Meeting all of the performance characteristics in the Salient Characteristics is significantly more important than the level of light sensitivity of the camera.<br><br>Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed product to industry or Government agencies.  Past performance will consider the ability of the offeror to meet technical specifications, delivery schedules (with warranty fulfillment and maintenance reputation included as applicable).  Offerors shall include three (3) records of sales from the previous 12 months.  Offerors shall identify a point of contact for each sale by providing a name and telephone number.  <br><br>Price will be evaluated based on the total proposed price, including options, (if any).<br><br>Technical (inclusive of light sensitivity) and past performance are of equal importance and when combined are significantly more important than price.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or by e-mail. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by an e-mail or facsimile of confirmation.

To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period.

<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NCND6021-11-01038DT.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 339950. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:<br />CLIN 0001 Provide design, fabrication and installation of 10 outdoor digital high pressure laminate (DHPL) interpretive signs measuring 36 inch wide by 24 inch tall and &frac12; inch thick for the Torch Oil/Platform Irene Oil Spill Natural Resources Trustee Council Rocky Intertidal Habitat Protection Program. The outdoor signs shall be installed at outdoor settings at entrances to rocky intertidal beaches in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. The remaining five signs and bases/mounting hardware are to be delivered to a location in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary<br />Rocky Intertidal Interpretive Signs and Graphic Panel Design and Fabrication</p>
<p>Contractor Responsibility<br />The contractor is responsible for design and fabrication of ten (10) outdoor interpretive signs. The signs will be 36" wide by 24" tall and &frac12; inch thick with rounded corners and fabricated from digital high pressure laminate (DHPL) material and shall have a 10 year warranty.</p>
<p>Five of the ten signs will be fully installed by June 30, 2012 in outdoor settings at entrances to rocky intertidal beaches in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties (approximate coordinates below). The remaining five signs and bases/mounting hardware are to be delivered to a location in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is leading the implementation of the Torch Oil/Platform Irene Oil Spill Natural Resources Trustee Council Rocky Intertidal Habitat Protection Program ("program"). The goals of the program are to provide local community outreach and education regarding the sensitivities of rocky intertidal habitats and to reduce the impacts from human disturbance on tide pools. Tide pools and other components of rocky intertidal shores represent a species-rich habitat which attracts a wide array of visitors and collectors. Human disturbance of tide pool areas is of concern and includes trampling of the resources, turnover of rocks, displacement of both living and non-living resources, and collecting of intertidal species or shells that can provide habitat. In addition to direct losses from trampling and collecting, secondary changes may result from changes in distribution, prey availability and competition. Under heavy use, patches of habitat become more frequently disturbed, allowing less time for recovery. <br />Program components include the design, fabrication and installation of interpretive signage and exhibit panels about rocky intertidal habitats. The interpretive signs will be located at various public locations such as overlooks, beaches and other popular ocean-view sites that are managed by federal, state or private partners. The interpretive signs will provide information to the public about natural history information about black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) and their adaptations to surviving in the rocky intertidal zone. They also will interpret the importance of protecting black abalone, current research underway to understand threats to their survival and ocean etiquette techniques to minimize impacts to remaining populations. The primary audience will be the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County communities and visitors to the area's beaches. <br />Objectives<br />The contractor will be responsible for working with staff from the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the Torch Oil Spill Rocky Intertidal Education Outreach Project Coordinator ("CINMS staff and Project Coordinator") to coordinate, design and fabricate interpretive signage, and to install signage in five (5) locations that are managed by a number of state, county and local partners.<br />The contractor will develop a systematic approach to rocky intertidal interpretive signage and use a list of common themes and messages. Each sign will have a common look and feel, yet it will need to be adaptable to the needs of the partners. Interactions with partners will be unified and baseline standards will be used.</p>
<p>Statement of Work<br />1. Development of a timeline for signage development, review, fabrication and installation. The contractor will deliver a timeline for the development, fabrication and installation of interpretive signs. Ten (10) signs are to be fabricated of which five (5) are to be installed and five (5) are to be delivered by June 30, 2012.</p>
<p>2. Development of sign content and design. The contractor shall work closely with CINMS staff and Project Coordinator to develop the sign content and overall design, utilizing provided text and photos. The contractor shall conduct regular meetings (in person and /or by phone &amp; email) between the project staff and any partners involved in this project as needed. The contractor shall be responsible for developing a design that incorporates the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries graphic standards and the standards required by the partners involved. The signs may differ by location depending on logos and standards of regional partners, but overall content (graphics/text) will remain the same. There will be an initial submittal of the text and photos by NOAA, a draft design returned to NOAA and then up to two cycles of review.<br /><br />3. Fabrication of signage. Ten (10) signs with the dimensions of 36" wide by 24" tall will be made from DHPL, &frac12; inch in thickness, with rounded edges. Eight (8) bases will be powder coated aluminum double leg low profile models with backing panel (KVO Slimline or similar). These bases will include 2 posts and a backing panel for each sign. Two (2) of the signs will be rail mounted and will require appropriate mounting hardware.</p>
<p>4. Exhibit installation/set-up. Subsequent to the fabrication of the signs, the contractor shall work with CINMS staff, Project Coordinator and partners to install five (5) signs. Three (3) of the signs are to be installed on double leg base mounts, with two (2) signs installed with rail mounts. The approximate locations include:</p>
<p>Location; # of Signs; Mount; Coordinates; County<br /><br />Coal Oil Point 1 double leg base bolted to panel 34 24' 26.00 N 119 52' 42.06 W Santa Barbara <br />Jalama Beach 1 double leg base bolted to panel 34 30' 40.06 N 120 30' 6.50 W Santa Barbara <br />Boathouse 1 double leg base bolted to panel 34 33' 17.06 N 120 36' 38.03 W Santa Barbara <br />Shell Beach 1 Rail mount 35 09' 55.03 N 120 41' 31.18 W San Luis Obispo<br />Shell Beach 1 Rail mount 35 10' 8.50" N 120 41' 46.35" W San Luis Obispo</p>
<p>5. Deliverables. All final graphics files for signs and graphics must be furnished to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary upon the completion of the project. Graphics files and the remaining five (5) signs with double leg base mounts are to be delivered to Laura Francis at a shipping address in Santa Barbara County, California.

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307." </span></p>

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. <br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded research programs using rodents to model aging processes and age-related diseases of humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain animal models suitable for the study of biological and behavioral processes in aging. A continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging.
<p>In 2004, NIA awarded a nine year contract to develop and maintain a colony of genetically- defined calorically-restricted rat and mouse strains. Since contract initiation, the Contractor has acquired breeding stock for two inbred strains of mice and two inbred strains of rats, re-derived the stock and provided NIA with documentation of the cesarean derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. The breeding and aging colonies have been developed for one inbred mouse strain, one hybrid mouse strain, one inbred rat strain and one hybrid rat strain, and animals have been distributed to the research community as requested. Presently, the contractor maintains a colony of approximately 3,000 rodents housed in two barriers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to continue services that are currently being provided by the Charles River Laboratories under contract number HHSN260200400003C until the renewal contract colony is fully developed and all ages are available to the research community. Breeding in contract number HHSN260200400003C will cease when the renewal contract colony begins entering into the aging colony, but the aging colony in contract number HHSN260200400003C will be maintained and provided to the research community as requested until the animals are gone or the termination date of this contract is reached, whichever comes first. In addition, the analysis of shipping patterns will provide valuable information to the NIA for managing this resource and the cryopreservation of embryos from the rat strains will ensure a future source for stock for new contracts. This has become an imperative due to the difficulties encountered in obtaining stock for this contract.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this acquisition is to: A) cryopreserve embryos from the rat strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C; B) provide an analysis of shipping patterns within contract number HHSN260200400003C; and C) continue the maintenance and distribution of the standing colony of aged, genetically-defined calorically-restricted rat and mouse strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C for use by investigators in studies of aging, while the renewal contract colony is being developed. This colony must be maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where the animals are monitored and characterized for diseases status and markers of genetic purity. <br /><br />The development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase takes approximately three (3) years. Animals are entered into the aging colony monthly so that there is a continuous supply available.</p>
<p>The NIA seeks to maintain the existing colony until the renewal contract colony has all ages available for the research community. In addition, the analysis provided in B) above will assist the NIA in determining the proper level of caloric restricted animals to maintain. Cryopreservation of embryos provided in part A) above will ensure that there is a continuing source of stock for future contracts. <br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:&nbsp; The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Breeding Colony Development; B)Breeding Colony Maintenance; C) Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D) Feeding Protocol; E) Environmental Requirements; F) Colony Evaluation and Monitoring; and G) Shipment of Animals to Investigators.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: A. Semiannual Progress Reports; B. Weekly Census Reports; C. Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports; D. Reports of the results of the semiannual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies; E. Postmortem Reports; and F. Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is four 12-month performance years from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2016.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 122990 ($0.75 Million); and (2) The contractor must have a current supply of rodents in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For this reason, the existing colonly cannot be transferred.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT. <br />a. Capability Statement - Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with rodent care and development, as well as formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) provide any catalog/list prices for services described in this notice; (3) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code(s); and (4) any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the OPDIV's acquisition requirements.<br /><br />b. Information Submission Instructions - Respondents should provide responses accordingly: (1) submit information both electronically and by mail. No telephone and facsimile responses will be accepted; (2) format capability statements using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF including attachments, resumes, charts, etc. Use single space, 12 font minimum and 8 &frac12; x 11 size paper; (3) organize material in such a manner that clearly identifies and address capability requirements and provide an executive summary; (4) capability statement should not exceed ten (10) single sided pages including references; (5) respondents must send two original copies via mail and one electronic copy via email; (6) RESPONSES SHOULD BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN <strong>NOVEMBER 25, 2011 at 2:00</strong> PM EDT; (7) include respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (8) send responses to this notice via email to dloeb@mail.nih.gov.

In addition, the analysis of shipping patterns will provide valuable information to the NIA for managing this resource and the cryopreservation of embryos from the rat strains will ensure a future source for stock for new contracts. This has become an imperative due to the difficulties encountered in obtaining stock for this contract.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this acquisition is to: A) cryopreserve embryos from the rat strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C; B) provide an analysis of shipping patterns within contract number HHSN260200400003C; and C) continue the maintenance and distribution of the standing colony of aged, genetically-defined calorically-restricted rat and mouse strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C for use by investigators in studies of aging, while the renewal contract colony is being developed. This colony must be maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where the animals are monitored and characterized for diseases status and markers of genetic purity. <br /><br />The development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase takes approximately three (3) years. Animals are entered into the aging colony monthly so that there is a continuous supply available.</p>
<p>The NIA seeks to maintain the existing colony until the renewal contract colony has all ages available for the research community. In addition, the analysis provided in B) above will assist the NIA in determining the proper level of caloric restricted animals to maintain. Cryopreservation of embryos provided in part A) above will ensure that there is a continuing source of stock for future contracts. <br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:&nbsp; The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Breeding Colony Development; B)Breeding Colony Maintenance; C) Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D) Feeding Protocol; E) Environmental Requirements; F) Colony Evaluation and Monitoring; and G) Shipment of Animals to Investigators.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: A. Semiannual Progress Reports; B. Weekly Census Reports; C. Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports; D. Reports of the results of the semiannual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies; E. Postmortem Reports; and F. Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is four 12-month performance years from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2016.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 112990 ($0.75 Million); and (2) The contractor must have a current supply of rodents in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For this reason, the existing colonly cannot be transferred.</p>

<DESC>For this Effort NAICS Code: 334515<br /><br />334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)<br /><br />1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.<br />2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.<br />3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):<br />a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz. <br />b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS. <br />c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.<br />d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).<br />The four subsystems described are as follows:<br />a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.<br />b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.<br />4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.<br />5. SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE<br />The following is an outline for a response to this RFI. Please provide the following per subsystem response. This outline will minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. <br />Section 1 Technological Capability <br />Identify technological capability related to the subsystem addressed. Identify open architecture, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, software and methodologies employed for signal and antenna pattern development.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development and qualification of a product to satisfy the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Weapon Capability (HAAWC) Air Launch Accessory requirements and ensure successful integration with the P-8A and MK 54 Torpedo.   

A draft RFP and related attachments will be issued electronically on or before 30 September 2011.  It is the Governments intent to review Industry comments/questions regarding the draft RFP prior to the release of any RFP.  

The draft RFP will include an electronic library for responder accessibility to unclassified HAAWC technical documentation.  

NAVSEA has established an Electronic Technical Information Center (E-TIC) to serve as the repository for unclassified technical information related to the HAAWC ALA procurement.
 Companies/individuals will be authorized access to this repository on a "need-to-know and appropriate security clearance" basis. In order to gain access to the unclassified E-TIC, prospective offerors must have a valid PKI Certificate either on their computer or with their CAC Card. Offeror's need to first fill out an Access Request at the following link https://www.aimtc.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/request.asp, and provide the information for the required fields (* - indicates required field). 

The following fields must be completed as follows: the 'branch' or 'code' supported is "PMS404", the 'Navy Sponsor POC' is "Walter Vanderbeek", the 'Navy Sponsor Code' is "PMS404", the 'justification for your need to know' is "Prospective Offeror for the HAAWC ALA Competition" and "HAAWC" is the area for which an Offeror has a 'need to know'.
 Then make sure to hit the SEND button at the bottom of the page. 

Offerors will receive an "AIMTC Request under consideration" notice, and then an AIMTC User Account Information email with login and password. This explains that if using a CAC card then offerors don't have to change password, if offerors are using a soft PKI Certification, passwords will need to be changed. Once an account has been established, prospective offerors can access the E-TIC via the Access by Tools menu and selecting AIMTC HAAWC.

A Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is provided as an attachment to this synopsis modification. In order to gain access to the unclassified E-TIC companies/individuals must complete the attached NDA and return as a PDF to Walter Vanderbeek at walter.vanderbeek@navy.mil and submit one PDF copy of the NDA to Graham Irby at graham.irby@navy.mil.
 

Assuming the associated forms and documentation required for access to the technical documentation is approved, companies/individuals will be granted access to the technical documentation upon receipt of the completed NDA. Information contained in the Navy's Electronic Technical Information Center (E-TIC) under the heading "HAAWC" is for the sole purpose of bidding on the HAAWC ALA Competition and no information therein shall be disclosed for any other purpose. Note that any updates to the documents in E-TIC will be announced via an automated system generated email sent to registered users of E-TIC. It is the interested parties' responsibility to gain access to E-TIC and regularly visit this site for updates.

Hard copy classified HAAWC technical documentation will be provided for those responders that are cleared to receive and store classified data up to the SECRET level.
  

For access to classified information, requests shall specifically include Respondents Name, Address and Zip Code, Cage Code and Cognizant Security Office (Name Address and Zip Code ) as well as the actual performance location including: Address and Zip Code, Cage Code and Cognizant Security Office, Address and Zip Code.  Classified documents will be forwarded only after Government review of the respondent's authorized security level and release of the draft RFP solicitation.  Access to classified information shall only be for the duration of the draft RFP including Government evaluation of the responses.

Access information and instructions are provided in anticipation of release of the draft RFP in order to expedite the distribution of the HAAWC technical documentation.
  As of the release of this pre-solicitation notice, the data library is populated with a single PLEASE READ file in order to verify access.  The data library will be populated with the HAAWC technical documentation upon release of the draft RFP.

All comments/questions regarding this pre-solicitation may be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Graham Irby, e-mail graham.irby@navy.mil (cc jodie.dajc@navy.mil).

Solicitation number HSCG38-12-Q-S00020 is issued as a Notice of Intent to Procure Items on a Sole Source basis. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The Coast Guard intends to issue a firm fixed price delivery order utilizing the terms and conditions of an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), for the overhaul of:
<p>1. Spindle Assembly Qty 1 Each <br />P/N: 70102-28100-054<br />Required Delivery: 120 days ARO and induction</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>1. This SOW provides for the following to like new condition of the Blue Spindle Assembly (NSN 1615-01-HS1-4256, P/N 70102-28100-054)&nbsp;for the Coast Guard's Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), MH-60 fleet. The spindle identified in the Description of Items or Services will be furnished to the contractor at the prices established at award for overhaul. The information contained in the scope of work is not intended to be all inclusive or to detract from procedures outlined in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specification except where noted herein. All repair actions shall be in accordance with the OEM commercial repair manuals and Federal Aviation Regulation Parts 43 and 145 or alternate standard approved in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Medium Response Recovery (MRR) Engineering Branch. Components furnished hereunder shall be returned by the contractor in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation in USCG aircraft. Certification and documentation requirements apply.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling repair manuals, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul the spindle assemblies for the Coast Guard fleet of MH-60 helicopters, as necessary to conform to the requirements of this SOW at the firm-fixed pricing established in the contract schedule. The contractor shall provide the data and documentation requirements specified as part of this SOW.</p>
<p>3. The work shall be in accordance with the OEM specifications except where noted herein. All Sikorsky ORI's that are applicable to the Naval Hawk production line shall be used in the performance of this contract. The contractor must have access to all needed maintenance, repair manuals and performance/test/acceptance criteria and data to ensure that equipment is overhauled/modified, calibrated and operating in accordance with the OEM's specifications.</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall also perform a visual and technical inspection in accordance with the current applicable Component Maintenance Manual and correct all additional deficiencies found. This shall include replacement of broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion.

Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas will be accomplished in accordance with the OEM specifications (or best commercial practices if not addressed by the OEM).</p>
<p>5. The Spindle Assemblies are flight critical. Serial numbers for these items are entered into the Coast Guard's Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) for tracking upon receipt at ALC. Upon receipt of the Spindle assemblies, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, MRR Supply Cell, in writing of the date of receipt, and shall confirm the serial number(s) of the item(s) received and the applicable task order number.

As a result, any part that is determined to be in serviceable condition, every effort shall be made to reuse that part from the component from which it was removed. Contractor is advised that in order to expedite deliveries, parts may be transferred to/from other USCG components but serial number integrity documentation is required under this contract. The contractor shall ensure that reused serviceable parts' serial numbers are documented as installed on the repaired component.</p>

<AWARDEE>Seaward Services, Inc., 1850 SE 17th Street, Suite 300
, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 US
<DESC>This contract provides for the operation and maintenance of the OSV BOLD, which is owned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Contractor provides qualified ship officers and crew, operational and technical support (ashore and afloat), equipment, tools, provisions and supplies, to operate, maintain and repair the vessel.
<p>This contract includes a six-month firm period (10 November 2011 through 9 May 2012; 182 days total). This contract is a bridge contract between the previous contract and the resulting contract from the follow-on solicitation (N00033-12-R-2501). The follow-on solicitation is in the acquisition planning stage, and it is anticipated that this procurement will be awarded in 6 to 12 months. Ship turnover will also take roughly 45 days. This bridge contract is necessary to provide enough time for the follow-on solicitation to be awarded.</p>
<p>This contract also includes FAR 52.217-8 (OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES), which will allow the Government to require continued performance for a period of up to six months (10 May 2012 through 9 November 2012; 184 days total), if required. <br /><br />The need to enter into a bridge contract resulted from the cancellation of solicitation N00033-10-R-2501. This solicitation was conducted as a small business set-aside. A new solicitation (N00033-12-R-2501) utilizing full and open competition has begun and is in the acquisition planning stage.</p>
<p>The period of performance under the previous contract, N00033-11-C-2502, ran through 9 November 2011. Since the contracting officer canceled solicitation N00033-10-R-2501, and the new follow-on solicitation (N00033-12-R-2501) is expected to be awarded in approximately 6-12 months, a sole source bridge contract was awarded to the incumbent contractor, Seaward Services. A bridge contract was the only available method to ensure continuous service, as the 52.217-8 extension under the previous contract had already been utilized.</p>
<p>The Government has a critical need for the continuation of services currently being provided by Seaward Services under contract N00033-11-C-2502. The inability to operate the EPA vessel would prevent the agency from meeting the mission critical needs that the OSV BOLD provides. The agency would not be able to meet the directives of the President's July 19, 2010 Executive Order establishing a new National Policy for the Stewardship of the Oceans, Coasts, and Great Lakes. The OSV BOLD also supports two statutory mandates, The Clean Water Act (CWA) and The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), as well as numerous other initiatives and agency priorities.</p>
<p>A separate posting on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) containing the Justification and Approval for this award will be available.</p>
