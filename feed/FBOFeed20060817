<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for ONE FEKO PLATINUM PARALLEL 12 PROCESSOR NODE-LOCKED LICENSE WITH FLOATING LICENSE. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items EM SOFTWARE & SYSTEMS (USA) INC., 144 RESEARCH DRIVE, HAMPTON, VA, 23666.  KSC is currently involved in a Computational Electromagnetic (CEM) modeling effort in support of the Launch Services Program. FEKO implements the Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (MLFMM) rather than the standard Method of Moments (MOM) technique.  This provides a reduction in memory usage from 60 terabytes down to 25 gigabytes, which is a drastic improvement of computer resource usage.  FEKO also incorporates a Finite Element Solver which allows for more dynamic changes in the model geometry.  Time domain harmonic sources are supported in the current version, and consequently calculation is done in the frequency domain. FEKO also provides a field solver and uses the ejwt time convention.  FEKO accepts input from a wide variety of different sources including incident plane wave, various voltage gap formulations (on wire segments as well as triangle edges), magnetic ring current (TEM-frill, with which a coaxial feed can be modeled) and impressed currents and patterns.  FEKO is one of the very few high frequency solvers that work with arbitrary geometries.  The use of any other software would be a risk to the program.	EM Software & Systems is the only source of FEKO software The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Sierra Scientific Instruments, Inc. for a ManoScan 360™ System, supplies, related accessories, and services for the VAMC Madison, located in Madison, WI.  In addition, the procurement will include the trade-in of existing VAMC Madison Manometry System.  To the best of our knowledge the ManoScan 360™ System is the only system which will meet the needs of the facility and provides catheter design that consists of 36 circumferential pressure elements with 12 linear pressure contacts placed radially on each element.  In addition, 432 pressure inputs are captured simultaneously by software that provides real time display of simultaneous in a continuous color image with pressure changes indicated by color change. During data acquisition and post-procedure the display can be toggled between high-resolution images and pressure waveform displays in up to 36 distinct channels.  Software has static and playback modes for simulating real time acquisition post procedure and virtual catheter pull through capabilities in waveform depiction mode during static display.  The system also provides simultaneous continuous circumferential pressure capture over 36cm length on catheter provides 9 times the pressure waveform data captured with conventional 4 channel waveform point-based Manometry systems of all other manufacturers.  Average procedure time is 10 minutes with ManoScan 360™ and is FDA approved.  Traditional point based systems require 45-90 minutes to perform 4 channel studies.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

The anticipated five year maximum obligation of each contract awarded under this solicitation is $30,000,000.  Each contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of $1,000 per fiscal year.  An average of $20,000,000 in task orders per year for all five geographic areas combined will be issued over the five year period.

The industry forum will be held in Kansas City at the Bannister Federal Complex, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri 64131, on August 31, 2006, 8:00 AM.  All parties interested in attending this event are asked to register by calling or emailing Josh Woods at 816-823-1726 or joshua.woods@gsa.gov.  The draft solicitation is available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status. Any questions in regard to the solicitation and/or the event shall be directed to Josh Woods no later than August 28, 2006 at 3:00 PM.  Contractors are urged to bring their own copies of the draft solicitation as copies will not be furnished at the industry conference.  The government reserves the right to accept or reject any comments provided.  If the government makes changes to the draft solicitation offerors will be provided a detailed listing that includes all changes made from the draft solicitation.  It is anticipated that the revised solicitation will be issued within 30 days from the date of the industry conference.

<DESC>SUBSCRIPTION  TO A SCANNER DATA BASE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.  The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is soliciting for a subscription to an Information Retrieval System containing Sales/Movement Data for scanned products sold by DeCA Commissaries and commercial supermarkets.  DeCA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Agency responsible for the operation of approximately 269 military commissaries throughout the world.  A commissary is the equivalent of a commercial grocery store.  The Information Retrieval System database must include sales/movement data for all scanned products sold by DeCA commissaries both within and outside the Continental United States (CONUS - defined as the 48 contiguous States); comparable, statistically significant sales data from a majority of supermarket chains throughout the United States; and sales movement data from supermarkets within the same geographical (metro) areas as commissaries.  In this context, supermarkets are defined as traditional grocery stores with annual volume over $2 million and Supercenter/mass merchant formats operated by Mass Merchandisers.  Access to any available causal data and data the contractor provides to other retailers is also required.  Available data should include the current month and the previous 24 months.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE that DeCA front-end scanner data is not readily available to the general public.  As mandated by statue (10 U.S.C. 2487b), DeCA makes this data available to interested firms for an annual subscription fee (currently $821,281 per year).  Execution of the requisite subscription agreement application and advance payment of $821,281 per year of data requested will entitle the subscriber to all available DeCA front-end scanner data for the years purchased.  The purchase of DeCA front-end scanner data IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF AN AWARD.  Respondents to this notice MUST be able to purchase not only DeCA front-end data but also the comparable commercial grocery store data for the same 24-month period.  Commercial grocery store chains offer their front-end data to interested firms on a fee basis.  DeCA is not interested in a contractor database that does not include front-end scanner data from both DeCA and comparable commercial sources, to include historical data.  Prior to DeCA awarding a contract for an Information Retrieval System, the successful offeror must execute an annual subscription agreement with DeCA.  The Preferred Data retrieval method will be accomplished by access to the contractor's database system through the World Wide Web.  The proposed hardware/software solution must include a user-friendly, menu-based drag and click type application that will allow for significant data manipulation and report building capabilities, to include ad-hoc reporting, by DeCA personnel.  Access to the web-based application must be compatible with the current DeCA network, shall not conflict with existing programs or capabilities, and shall not impede current operations.  If web-based application does not allow for the ability to produce ad-hoc reports, contractor shall submit alternative method for access to database that includes the same characteristics as outlined above.  As a minimum, either method of access must enable the operator to generate reports, to include ad-hoc reports, based on any number of parameters, to include, but not limited to: (1) Geographic Areas (DeCA regions, areas within regions, stores, and commercially defined markets); (2) Products (departments, categories, sub-categories and/or segments, brands, manufacturers, and a full range of product attributes such as UPC, selling unit size, selling unit type (can, bottle, etc.), selling unit flavor, and other well-defined product characteristics; (3) Measures and Derivative Calculations (dollar sales, unit sales, volume sales, Average Cumulative Volume (ACV) percent, average pricing (promotional, non-promotional), lift percentages, sales per point of distribution, etc); and (4) Time Periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541910 and the Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.  A solicitation will be issued for this requirement on or about September 8, 2006 with an anticipated closing date of October 6, 2006.  Organizations who believe they meet the requirements as identified above may submit their request for the solicitation to:  Defense Commissary Agency, AMDR (Will Madera), 1300 E Avenue, Fort Lee, VA 23801-1800.  Information must include the following: 1. Requester's name 2. Company name and address 3. Business size (large or small business) 4. Telephone/facsimile numbers 5. Dun and Bradstreet (DUNs) Number 6.  Indicate whether your firm can provide this service and a detailed description of how your firm would expect to acquire the necessary scanner data to meet the requirement. 7. Past Performance information listing sources that utilize organization's current database system for scanner data.  Facsimile requests to (804) 734-8669 or electronic mail to wilfredo.madera@deca.mil will be accepted.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA under FAR 6.102(d)(2).  This announcement seeks to conduct with a manufacturing company development of new, unexplored technology to design and produce a high-energy underwater Acoustic Impulse Source (AIS).  Interested firms should respond with brief documentation showing the company’s ability to fulfill the requirements described below.  Qualified firms must possess the industrial and technical experience for the development of new, unexplored technology.  Only prime contractors should respond.  A list of responding prime contractors will be furnished to potential sub-contractors upon request (via NFESC).  The AIS may use any suitable process to create the desired waveform.  The intent is to attain the objective pulse attributes while exploring techniques for generating similar waveforms with different combinati9ons of peak pressure and impulse.  The general characteristics of the objective waveform at a distance of 10-meters from the source should be:  1) peak acoustic pressure of 2600-psi (265 dB); 2) absolute impulse levels of 630 psi-msec; 3) pulse widths of 1.0 to 5.0 milliseconds; 4) ability to generate multiple pulses at intervals of 2 to 10-seconds; 5) ability to generate thousands of pulses without machine failure; 6) capable of operation after 30-days of salt water immersion to depths as great as 130-ft; 7) utilize non-electric sources of power (i.e., compressed gas or hydraulics). Abstract submittals for this BAA should be made using the abstract form located at the following Internet address:  http://enviro.nfesc.navy.mil.  Click on Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies, and follow the instructions for submitting an abstract on line.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery â€“ indefinite quantity contract, with a cost plus fixed fee pricing arrangement, to Passport Systems, Inc. of Acton, MA.  The contract will be awarded pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302- 1.  The contract is a follow-on procurement to the competitively awarded contract N66001-05-D-6011 with Passport Systems, Inc.  Contract N66001-05-D- 6011 was awarded to Passport Systems, Inc. for their proposal in response to the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency Broad Agency Announcement 04-02 "Detection Systems for Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures" issued on 30 January 2004.  The follow-on contract will continue work initiated by Passport Systems under the competitive contract N66001-05-D-6011, and will permit the contractor to perform all systems engineering efforts required to research, develop, design, build, and test a "Proof-of-Concept" non-intrusive scanner based on Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence Imaging and Effective-Z three-dimensional Imaging for the purpose of detecting and interdicting terrorist transport of nuclear weapons and materials.  The use of any other contractor for this acquisition would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition, as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling vital national security requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis, services required for the Measuring prediagnostic levels of serum vitamin D metabolites in two studies of prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma with Heartland Assays Inc., 173 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC 29425.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of the procurement is to conduct assays to measure the serum levels of vitamin D metabolites in two NCI studies: 1) Marker of vitamin D status, are associated with risks of prostate cancer and 2) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The specific objectives of this procurement are to measure 25(OH)D levels in specimens in the two projects, and measure 1,25(OH)2D levels for a random sample of 200 controls from the prostate cancer study.  Specifically, the Contractor shall: a) Measure serum levels of 25(OH)D in a run-in sample of 40 samples (eight replicate samples from five volunteers, collected at SAIC-Frederick) to check the assay reproducibility prior to initiating analysis of study samples; b) Transmit a spreadsheet containing the measurement data from the run-in samples to the DCEG investigators for inspection; c) Measure serum levels of 25(OH)D in all samples from both studies (prostate, 1,980 samples; NHL, 528 samples); d) Transmit a spreadsheet containing the 25(OH)D measurements to the DCEG investigators; e) Measure serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D in a run-in sample of 40 specimens to check the assay reproducibility prior to initiating analysis of study samples; f) Measure serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D in 200 control subjects from the prostate cancer study; and g) Transmit a spreadsheet containing the 1,25(OH)2D measurements to the DCEG investigators.

NCI investigators are currently analyzing specimens from the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites and the risk of developing a variety of cancers.  A study of colorectal adenoma has been completed, a study of breast cancer is underway as well as studies of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer.  All vitamin D assays of PLCO samples for these projects have been conducted by Heartland Assays Inc.  For scientific comparability, it is critical that the vitamin D assays of additional PLCO samples that we now plan to measure in studies of prostate cancer, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma continue to be carried out in this laboratory. Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current PLCO experiments in progress.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on August 31, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  Please reference NCI-60154-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the purchase of an electronic chassis, backplane (ePCI), power supplies, communication test box and associated cables for the development of commercial and in-house electronics boards and software.    NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Broad Reach Engineering who is the only known responsible source.  NASA LaRC research staff are developing an Advanced Avionics suite of hardware and software for future applications in both flight and space environments.  As the result of a competitive procurement, NASA LaRC procured engineering models of flight rated electronics boards from Broad Reach Engineering. A chassis, backplane (ePCI), power supplies, communication test box and associated cables are required to provide the unique wiring for communicating among all the boards.  NASA LaRC has expended substantial resources in the development of the Advanced Avionics suite using the Broad Reach Engineering electronics boards.  Purchase of the chassis from other than Broad Reach Engineering would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The sole source authority for this item is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 28, 2006.

Interested parties are advised to visit the following site after 1 September 2006 to obtain a a copy of the RFQ:  www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/sapcbd/lowdose.htm This site will  contain and constitute our Request for Quotation . Email any questions to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at dawson.paul@epa.gov.  Period of performance: From date of award to March 31, 2008							 	I. Purpose 	The purpose of this effort is to create a report entitled "State-of-the-Science:  Low Dose-Response Extrapolation: Issues and Approaches". The State-of-the-Science report will summarize the state-of-the-science for low dose-extrapolation, articulate lessons learned from past risk assessment experiences, raise important issues, suggest a framework approaching low-dose  extrapolation, and foster discussion in the broad risk assessment community. In particular, the report will seek to foster discussion across sectors of the risk assessment community that currently have limited interaction, e.g. toxics and criteria pollutants. There are seeming inconsistencies  within EPA's practices related to estimation of human population risks from environmental exposures. These inconsistencies arise from differences in: conceptualization of issues and approaches regarding low-dose extrapolation. A state-of-the-science report is proposed to evaluate the applicability  of lessons learned from the most robust environmental health risk assessments available, to less robust assessments, primarily those that must rely on animal toxicology with limited or no epidemiology data. Specifically, reviews of chemicals/agents such as particulate matter (Samet et al., 2000;  EPA, 2004, 2006), environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (USHHS, 2006) and radiation risk assessments (NRC, 2005) may provide "lessons learned" that could inform other risk assessments. To create this State-of-the-Science report will require multidisciplinary expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology,  and mechanisms/mode of action, as well as significant experience with risk assessments and conducting underlying technical analyses for criteria air pollutants, ETS and radiation. Additionally, substantial experience considering analyzing highly technical information in the field of biostatistics  and epidemiology, integrating data and information, synthesize findings will be required. Demonstrable substantial skill in building consensus and describing areas of important scientific disagreement among scientific community is also required. II. Background The EPA's new Guideline for Cancer  Risk Assessment (2005) raises scientific issues: 1) that have not been previously well address for toxic chemicals in the EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS); 2) continue to be issues of interest in criteria pollutant assessments, ETS and radiation; 3) are relevant to cancer and noncancer  effects; and 4) are critical for the Agency's risk assessment work.  Low-dose extrapolation issues that must be included, but are not limited to, are: mode of action analyses, human interindividual variability, additivity to existing process, and additivity of background and/or coincident exposures  into dose-response assessment. It is the aim of this project to build on the science and past experience with chemicals/agents, such as the criteria air pollutants, ETS and radiation, in order to facilitate the future scientific evaluation of the IRIS chemicals and criteria air pollutants; and  raise the level of discourse across different risk assessment communities of practice.  The historical backgrounds of chemical risk assessment for cancer and noncancer are somewhat different :  ?	Historically, it had been thought that cancer was a fundamentally stochastic process and  dose-response were likely to be linear at low doses, while noncancer toxicity was inherently nonlinear, exhibiting a threshold . Thus, one motivation for the development of quantitative cancer risk assessment was a concern that, due to the stochastic nature of the cancer process, even doses of a  carcinogen well below the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for tumors in animals could entail an unacceptable risk of cancer to humans. On the basis of this understanding of the carcinogenic process, low-dose risk extrapolation approaches were originally developed for cancer risk assessment  (Crump et at., 1976). ?	In contrast, noncancer endpoints have generally been evaluated using a threshold assumption. The origins of this belief are embedded in the early history of toxicology , and the experience of most toxicologist, physicians and individuals with relatively small sample sizes.  Additionally, the "thresholds" can depend heavily on the definition of an adverse effect.  Among all chemicals in the EPA Integrated Risk Information System database (>500), there are no examples of using a linear low-dose extrapolation for a noncancer endpoint. Rather the standard approach used  for noncancer is dividing a NOAEL or lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) by uncertainty factors (to account for uncertainty in extrapolation). Arguments for linear, low dose extrapolation for non cancer endpoint have, however, been made elsewhere (Gaylor, 1989; Lutz et al., 2005; US EPA,  2006). As understanding of both cancer and noncancer effects has advanced, there has been growing recognition that these views are overgeneralizations. Four issues that make low-dose extrapolation complex are discussed below. Mode of Action - The molecular and cellular events that underlie cancer  and noncancer toxicity (also termed "mode of action" or "mechanism of action") are likely to be complex phenomena that are a mix of linear and dose-transitional events.  A topic of much debate inside and outside EPA is the determination of the linear or nonlinear nature of the events underlying  carcinogenicity and toxicity.  A common assumption is that if nonlinear or dose-transitional processes can be identified as part of the mode of action that is a sufficient rational for a using a nonlinear population dose-response, with an actual or effective threshold, to estimate population  dose-response (US EPA, 2005; Slikker et al., 2004). Biostatistical issues (below) that additionally should be considered in population dose-response assessment have received limited discussion in the "toxics" community. Human Interindividual Variability - Another factor that militates against a  simplistic threshold assumption for cancer or noncancer risk assessments is the impact of human interindividual variability on the dose of a chemical that could cause an adverse effect in some portion of a population (Renwick, 1999; Hattis et al. 2002, Gaylor and Kodell, 2002). Thus, in contrast to  the historical view, it can be argued that there is no more, or less, justification for the use of low-dose risk extrapolation in the case of cancer risk assessment than noncancer, (Crump et al., 1997) and that low-dose risk extrapolation is as useful, and no less certain, for noncancer risk  assessment as for cancer (Hattis et al., 2002).  Alternatively, in the "toxic" risk assessment community, an uncertainty factor of 10 generally is incorporated in to the dose-response assessment (lowering the reference value) and is considered sufficient to account for human interindividual  variability. It has been suggested that the single most important uncertainty in noncancer risk estimates is the extent of human interindividual variability in the doses of specific chemicals that cause adverse responses. This conclusion is likely to be just as relevant to cancer risk assessment as  to noncancer, although population variability has historically received little attention in cancer risk assessment (Clewell and Crump, 2005). Additivity to Existing Process - Careful review of the literature shows that linear low-dose risk extrapolation has also been defended when the effects of a  chemical are additive to an existing background process (Crump et al., 1976, Hoel, 1980, Clewell and Crump, 2005). This justification can be applied equally well to the case of a background incidence of noncancer toxicities as it can to a background incidence of cancer. Examples of noncancer  effects with an existing background in the general population include cardiovascular events, pulmonary insufficiency, male reproductive deficits, and developmental defects. Many cancers also have a significant background incidence in the general population. Additivity of Dose/Exposure - Additivity  of tissue dose for a specific toxic agent - as a result of multiple sources of external exposure and/or metabolic production of the agent from multiple substrates is an important issue for some chemicals.  Current examples include chlorinated solvents (e.g., trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene)  where different compounds give rise to common metabolites that may contribute to toxicity, such as arsenic where multiple sources of exposure to multiple forms of inorganic and organic arsenicals can result in tissue doses of trivalent methylated metabolites that may be critical to the production  of toxic effects (Paul White, personal communication, 2005).

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract to purchase a license agreement to use its Risk and Reliability Workstation (R&RW) program and eight training workshops with Data Systems and Solutions, LLC (DS&S). The period of performance for this project is one year, with two one year option periods. There are a total of 8 option workshop training sessions included in the base and option years; two sessions for the base and three sessions for each option year. This notice is not a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 41 U.S.C. 253( c)( 1 ), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (b)( 1) which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy NRC's requirements. The NRC has issued a policy statement to use PRA technology in all regulatory matters in a manner that complements the NRC's deterministic approach and supports the NRC's traditional defense-in-depth philosophy. The defense-in-depth philosophy is a traditional concept applied in reactor design and operation to provide multiple means to accomplish safety functions and prevent the release of radioactive materials. Within the framework of the NRC PRA policy, the risk-informed regulation will provide improved regulatory decision making and promote more efficient use of agency resources in focusing efforts on safety significant issues, and thus, it reduces industry burden in less safety-significant areas. The NRC also recognized that utilities are using many different risk models for their Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methods and employ a large spectrum of PRA quantification computer codes, such as RISKMAN, CAFTA, NUPRA, SAFETY MONITOR, EOOS, GRAFTER, REBECA, etc. In order to maintain an independent capability, the NRC also developed its own tool, SAPHIRE, which may or may not be compatible with the licensee's computer codes, even for same risk models. The R&R workstation is compatible with NRC's SAPHIRE. Thus, it is desirable to communicate with utility licensees using computer software packages which are mutually consistent and comprehensible. The R&R workstation is owned by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and represented by DS&S, and provides a platform to manage and evaluate risk data and to connect the various computer codes in use. The NRC is developing various risk-based methodologies to support risk-informed regulatory applications using various computer codes, and has evaluated the R&R Workstation in parallel with the SAPHIRE and other computer codes. It is beneficial to use R&R Workstation to enhance the communicability with the licensees, since 25 U.S. utilities with 71 units, 10 international organizations, and 6 Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) vendors joined the R&R Workstation user's group and the workstation can be used with or in parallel with other codes and risk models. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is an organization sponsored by the U.S. electric utility industry to perform research to support their operations. EPRI membership includes utility owners of all U.S. nuclear reactors except one. However, the one exception is participating in the EPRI R&R Workstation as an outside member. Products and technology developed by EPRI is made available to all it's members. EPRI is the lead organization performing research for U.S. nuclear utilities, and has developed PSA technology for nuclear power since its inception. The EPRI R&R Workstation is the culmination of this effort. No other organization has in place the ability to support the entire nuclear utility industry in the U.S. with PSA tools.  Data Systems and Solutions, LLC (DS&S) is the lead contractor to EPRI for the R&R Workstation, which was developed by EPRI with contractor supports. All EPRI members have free access to the software. DS&S has commercialization rights for R&R Workstation, including distribution to all non-EPRI members, and runs the user group and other support activities. As the developer, DS&S is uniquely qualified to provide NRC the necessary training, as well as software development expertise to create and apply applications. No other organization is authorized to distribute and support R&R Workstation products, and only DS&S can provide the R&R Workstation and its's support to the NRC. The EPRI R&R Workstation is a full scope PSA development and application toolkit. The R&R Workstation is able to support most PSA models developed by U.S. utilities, and can provide NRC with the ability to directly manipulate models provided by utilities. The R&R Workstation is an open system, and DS&S provides documentation and support to allow users to have the ability to enhance existing applications, and create new applications using individual built-in elements of the workstation functions. These are the features other similar products or software package do not have, and the developer may have to create such new features individually and separately. No other software package has this level of interconnectivity, and wide spread usage within the U.S. utility market. It will minimize the work necessary for NRC to acquire and manipulate licensee's risk models in a manner that will, in most cases, eliminate the concern of using different tools from those of the licensee. It will provide NRC with the flexibility to use multiple contractors to develop and support new PSA applications. The R&R Workstation risk monitor product EOOS, is unique when compared to other products available in the industry. EOOS is part of an overall compatible suite of PSA tools. Only EOOS has fully integrated PSA modeling package to support it. When compared to safety monitor, EOOS provides the ability to link directly to a number of high performance quantification engines, and allows the ability to manipulate RISKMAN Models, or cut-set models created by the packages. Furthermore EOOS provides defense in depth calculations that are not available in SAFETY MONITOR. The other Risk Monitor in use today is ORAM/Sentinel, and uses a simplified risk model(ORAM), or a look-up table to access pre-solved results (Sentinel). There is no capability to directly solve or manipulate risk models. EOOS is being used in the vast majority of risk monitor applications. NRC, already has experience using EOOS in some of their ongoing projects. The R&R Workstation is a computer-based PSA application toolkit, which uses input from individual users for specific applications. Therefore, the commercial agreement to use this toolkit does not constitute a conflict of interest, since the toolkit does not include any proprietary information or properties developed or owned by other member utilities, nor disclose any NRC's proprietary information to utilities. The license agreement is proprietary to DS&S and is not available from any other source. As a result of market research conducted, no other software package has this level of interconnectivity, and wide spread usage within the U.S. utility market.  There are no similar or same products as the DS&S/EPRI R&R workstation that provides membership for all the major PSA vendors and yet is also compatible with NRC's SAPHIRE and other software packages for wide applications. Other potential product packages require the developer to create new features which are already built in the R&R workstation. The time and the cost to develop the similar capability and software packages with such level of sophistication and interconnectivity will be prohibitive for other potential sources. It will provide NRC with the flexibility to use multiple contractors to develop and support new PSA applications. The EOOS of the R&R Workstation is a part of an overall compatible suite of PSA tools. Only EOOS has fully integrated PSA modeling package to support it. When compared to safety monitor, EOOS provides the ability to link directly to a number of high performance quantification engines (Le., CAFTA, NUPRA, IRRAS, etc.), and allows the ability to manipulate Riskman Models, or cut-set models created by the packages. Furthermore EOOS provides defense-in-depth calculations that are not available in safety monitor. The ORAM/Sentinel uses a simplified risk model(ORAM), or a look-up table to access pre-solved results (Sentinel), and does not have capability to solve or manipulate risk models directly. EOOS is being used in the vast majority of risk monitor applications.Thus, DSS/EPRI, offering already-applicable R&R Workstation, is the only source capable of delivering the product performing the state objectives in the required time frame and cost. All responsible sources can respond by no later than August 23, 2006. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. Telephone and e-mail requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to SuperWylbur, 4720 Edgefield Road, Bethesda, Md  20814 for SuperWylbur Perpetual License and Maintenance.  Superwylbur software is the industry standard for batch processing.  This product’s predecessor Wylbur has been installed and is currently being used at CMS. CMS must upgrade to Superwylbur to support a recent DB2 upgrade and other recent mainframe performance enhancements, as Wylbur can not support these changes.  This software manages mainframe utilization, a critical activity for successfully administrating the Medicare program, the Drug Card Program and the MMA. The use of this product is critical as it is already widely used, understood and deeply embedded in the mainframe environment.  As Superwylbur is the industry standard, there are no other sources that meet the Government’s needs.  At the present time it is not possible to introduce a new contractor with an untested and potentially unreliable product. Any delay in awarding this order to Superwylbur will result in disruption to the processing of Medicare claims and potentially cause considerable harm to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries.  Superwylbur is the only responsible source that can provide the software maintenance, and upgrades necessary to fulfill CMS batch processing requirements within the timeframes the Agency requires.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Questions/Responses are provided as an attachment to this announcement. --------------------------------------------------------------- Amendment #A002 (attached) is issued to revise paragraph 2(b) by changing the number of full-time employees from 200 to 150 that vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneousley employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed for a period not less than one (1) year.  Time and date for receipt of offers is changed from August 18, 2006 to September 5, 2006.  It is anticipated that responses to questions will be posted Thursday, August 17, 2006. ------------------------------------------------------------ Since issuance of the Announcement/SIR No. 1 the FAA has received several questions from potential offerors seeking clarification.  Amendment #A001 (attached) to the Announcement/SIR No. 1 is issued extending the scheduled closing date for receipt of offers to August 18, 2006, in order to allow time for consideration of the questions and answers and associated changes.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "3-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluations of Tiers 2 and 3, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns limited to Area VI (AR, LA, NM, CO, OK, and TX).  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide SEDB/8(a) firms.  Tier 3, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "3-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.  If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified from both Tier 1 and Tier 2, Tier 3 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 through 3, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 through 3 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.   For purposes of this requirement, a Small Business is defined as follows: 1) Classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment) - $25/million.   2) An eligible SEDB/8(a) small business concern expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the 8(a) program and which meets such criteria at the time of submission of the offer.   Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.  All documentation to enter into a joint venture must be submitted with response to this SIR No. 1. Each firm claiming SEDB/8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this SIR1.  Offerors are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  The 25-page limit only applies to the technical proposal (financial statements are exempt from the page limit of 25).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  Experience:   		(a) Document vendor's or predecessors experience with engineering and computer support services as identified in the attached PWS, Section 2, Areas of Effort, for ground-based National Airspace System (NAS) equipment or similar systems and equipment.  Note: A predecessor corporation is a corporation, which has existed in the past, has been replaced by a corporation which exists today, and for which a legal chain of successorship can be documented.  Mergers and acquisition activity accounts for such a predecessor-successor chain among corporations.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information: (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 		(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate an ability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 		(a) Vendors must demonstrate that Contract Manager will be available at the time of contract award that meets the qualifications identified in the PWS.  Documentation as to individual qualification may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  Resume should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), educational background, and training in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and technical or management competence. 		(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 200 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: 1) a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, 2) signed certification with a list of employees with date of employment including employees' managers and the manager's qualifications. 		(c) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate successful recruitment capabilities and competitive employee benefits in order to recruit and retain a highly educated and skilled work force.   	3.  Accounting System and Financial Capability: 		Provide documentation that your company: 			(a) Currently has an "acceptable" job cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable type contracts according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards.  Identify your company's accounting system software package.  Provide the date of and the name of the DCAA field office performing the latest accounting systems audit.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-207C3, Patuxent River, MD intends to hold an INDUSTRY DAY Conference.     
The goal of the conference will be to gather potential industry feedback in regards to the C/KC-130T Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.

The conference is scheduled to be held on 30 August 2006 at the J.T. Daugherty Conference Center, 22111 Three Notch Road, Lexington Park,     Maryland, 20653, 301-863-2637, from 0800 to 1700 (Eastern Standard Time).  Parties interested in attending the conference are encouraged to contact Ms. Jackie Mercer via e-mail Jackie.mercer@navy.mil and  Ms. Mary Ann Foran via e-mail Maryann.foran@navy.mil. All interested parties, please provide the following information: Organization name and address, primary POC, business size, location, company officers, phone/fax and e-mail of the primary POC, and if your interested as a Prime or Subcontractor.     Each company is limited to seven personnel attending the conference.  Of these seven personnel, only five personnel will be allowed to attend the one-on-one meeting sessions due to room size limitations.   Vendors that RSVP prior to 25 August 2006 will be provided the opportunity to register for a one-on-one meeting with the program office limited to no more than 30 minutes.  Vendors that wish to participate in the one-on-one meetings registering after 17 August 2006, but before the RSVP date of 25 August 2006, will be scheduled to have their one–on-one meetings on 31 August 2006.  This is due to the overflow of scheduling for 30 August 2006.  These one-on-one sessions are an opportunity for vendors to provide more information about their individual companies.  If the company chooses to use a power point presentation during the one-on-one, the Government requests that 16 paper copies of that presentation be provided.  There will be no fee associated with attending this industry day.  

THE INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED OR FOR ANY TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative is a collaborative effort to harness the power of information technologies to modernize structured learning.  It sets forth a new paradigm to provide access to the highest quality education and training that can be tailored to individual needs and delivered cost-effectively, whenever and wherever it is required.  The ADL Initiative employs a structured, adaptive, collaborative effort between the public and private sectors to develop the standards, tools, and learning content for the future-learning environment.

The ADL Initiative created a network of four ADL Co-Laboratories (ADL Co-Labs) to advance the initiative and to serve distinct areas of operational responsibility.  The ADL Co-Lab Network serves as the focal point and catalyst for the large-scale cooperative research, development, implementation and assessment of ADL technologies and related products.  As a member of that ADL Co-Lab Network, the Joint ADL Co-Lab integrates instruction and technology to meet the military’s training requirements.  It actively pursues research interests to advance the state of distributed learning within the Department of Defense.

PROGRAM SCOPE
The Joint ADL Co-Lab (JADL) anticipates making multiple awards with the dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $400,000 for each award.  Offerors may propose on one or more research areas and offerors are encouraged to aggregate two or more research areas in one white paper solution.  Contractors may also Team to propose on research focus areas. The planned method for accomplishing the research in each prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.  Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research area(s) address a Basic Effort (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II).  The white paper must address at least one of the research areas listed in the BAA and must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  See attached Enclosure.

PHASE I
Phase I will be a 12-month effort (we will accept some deviation from the 12-month requirement with appropriate justification) and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area.  The effort will culminate in an initial capabilities demonstration in the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2008.

PHASE II
Phase II will be a 12-month effort (we will accept some deviation from the 12-month requirement with appropriate justification) and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area.  Final capabilities demonstration will be at the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2009.  Phase II funding is at the discretion of the JADL.

Each white paper must include a statement that the offeror agrees to:

a)	The formal exchange of technical information developed under this effort with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and/or Associated Contract Agreements (ASA),
b)	Participation in at least two mandatory technical interchange meetings with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, and 
c)	Government purpose rights applying to both technical data and software developed under this effort

For projects using the Microsoft .NET framework, the Open Platform for E-Learning (OPEL) is being developed by the Joint ADL Co-Lab for use by the distance learning community and is available to prototype program participants.  The platform is intended to allow prototypes to focus the maximum amount of available funding on value-added research by avoiding the need to develop basic SCORM input/output mechanisms and a graphical user interface for demonstrations.  The platform provides:

    * A SCORM Document Object Model (DOM) that allows for object-oriented reading, writing, and modification of SCORM-conformant files.

    * The “ADL Prototype Program Workbench”, a user-friendly Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides:
            * A graphical user interface (GUI) for working with the SCORM DOM.
            * Reusable design surfaces for displaying and editing common data types (text, XML, charts/graphics, workflow, etc.)
            * Integrated diagnostics capabilities (logging, error reporting, etc.)

    * Code integrated from past prototypes serving a variety of functions.

Prototypes may provide workbench plug-ins, DOM extensions, or entirely new libraries as a means to demonstrate prototype functionality.  If your organization is interested in using OPEL, please contact the Joint ADL Co-Lab for further information. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION
Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the needs identified in this announcement may submit a white paper.  White paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received by the Joint ADL Co-Lab no later than 1500 EST on 25 September 2006.  No extensions will be granted.  White papers must address requirements for both phases and shall not exceed 5 pages in length of computerized text at 12 pitch, excluding resumes and diagrams.  Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed by the JADL Evaluation Team to best meet the program objectives.  

WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA
White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:

1.	Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to one or more BAA topics.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.  Also, innovative teaming arrangements should be taken into consideration.  Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  

2.	Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed program will meet the goal of one or more BAA topics.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential alternative approaches and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving Distributed Learning should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered.  

3.	Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offeror’s history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.

4.	Personnel: The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for this effort.

5.	Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.
  
White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted.  The Government intends to use non-government personnel to assist in the evaluation of white papers/proposals.  Contract personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contract personnel are required to sign Conflict of Interest and Non-Disclosure Statements.  Offerors will be notified whether or not the white paper was favorably received.  Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the government to fund the effort in whole or in part.  Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter with complete instructions for proposal preparation and submission.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  

This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding.  The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission.  Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitutes the Government’s solicitation for this effort.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  

WHITE PAPER FORMAT:  White papers shall not exceed 5 pages of computerized text at 12 pitch (excluding cost estimates and diagrams).  Contractor format is acceptable; however, a preferred format is provided as an Enclosure to the BAA. The white papers should be provided in both hardcopy and electronic form no later than 1500 EST 25 September 2006.  NOTE: Both, the hardcopy and the electronic copy MUST BE received together, by the due date/time.

SUBPART 5301.91 -- OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose.
The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to consider concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight, and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. 
5301.9102 Policy.
(a) MAJCOM and DRU commanders shall appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their MAJCOM/DRU. For AFMC and AFSPC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. 
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g. administrative support, independent review teams). 
(c) Contracting officers shall identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP. 
(d) The ombudsman shall: 
(1) Act neutrally to facilitate resolution of issues or concerns raised by concerned parties; 
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the concerned party, and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority); 
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the commander, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; for AFMC and AFSPC centers, report only to the Center Commander, Laboratory Commander, or PEO; and for other MAJCOM/DRUS, report only to the MAJCOM CC or PEO;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of $2,500, consistent with the procedures in the contract; 
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by concerned parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes. 
(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, or those having Air Force wide implications. 
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts.
*****
5305.207 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopsis 

(20) In all synopsis announcing competitive or sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer shall indicate that the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable.
*****
5316.505 Ordering. (Deleted)
*****
5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. 

As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: 
OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
(End of clause)
Questions about this acquisition should be emailed to 2LT Derrick Cash at Derrick.Cash@mcguire.af.mil or Mrs. Roseclair Thompson at roseclair.Thompson@mcguire.af.mil

The TD Project will design and develop an airbursting individual weapon system  to meet user identified capability gaps for revolutionary lethality, while  extending stand-off range; defeating defilade targets, providing day, night  and all weather capability; and incorporating a multifunctional fire control  sub-system. The four overall objectives of the TD phase will be  first, to continue design  of the Target Acquisition/Fire Control system; second, continue design of the  25mm airburst delivery platform; third, design the family of ammunition (Air  burst, Anti Personnel, Armor Piercing); and fourth, continue integration of   the subsystems.  To achieve these objectives it may be necessary to build,  integrate and test full-up systems. The contractor must also provide system  engineering, design engineering, materials, services, testing, technical  management, quality assurance, equipment, facilities, prototyping, and  administration, as applicable.  These efforts will continue the development an  individual HEAB weapon system that meets the system performance requirements. The Government will employ Acquisition Reform principles, including Integrated  Product Teams (IPT's), Simulation and Modeling, Cost as an Independent  Variable (CAIV), Integrated Data Environment (IDE), Clear Accountability in  Design, Earned Value Management (EVM)(modified reporting requirements  contractor format acceptable), and Open Systems to balance cost, schedule, and performance risks for the TD Phase.  The contractor will be responsible to  organize, coordinate, and control program activities to comply with contract  requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services.  The  contractor shall also monitor the progress of work performed and costs  incurred under the contract.  The contractor shall prepare progress, status,  and management reports.  The contractor will develop and maintain an  Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) with no restrictions. At the conclusion of the TD effort, the contractor shall document and deliver  an updated system performance specification of the Individual HEAB Weapon  System, reflecting the performance levels validated through use of contractor  tests and Government technical tests (when applicable).   The contractor shall  also document and deliver draft performance specifications of the subsystem  level requirements. The contract effort will consist of a base effort plus eight discretionary  phases of development; Insensitive Munitions (IM) Baseline Test, Family of  Ammunition Concepts, Hardware for Government Testing, Hardware for User  Evaluation, Contractor Support to Government Tests and Demonstrations, Target  Acquisition/Fire Control for the FFW, Long Lead Items and Technical Data  Package.  The Government will reserve the unilateral right to fund or forego  these phases based on technical requirements and/or availability of funds.   A  Sole Source Request for Proposal (RFP) to be posted on the TACOM-ARDEC  Acquisition Center website located at: http://procnet.pica.army.mil  is  planned for release on or about 31 August 2006.  The point of contact for this  requirement is David DeCandia, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-AQ-APD, BLDG 10,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: decandia@pica.army.mil, telephone  number: 973-724-4674.

<DESC>Description
	
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by Los Alamos National Security, L.L.C. (LANS) for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation to place a Master Task Ordering Agreement (MTOA) subcontract with an integrating contractor that will design and construct 20 sub-projects that comprise the TA-55 Reinvestment Project (TRP).  This Nuclear Facility is a high security, Hazard Category 2 non-reactor nuclear facility that is 28 years old and in need of refurbishment or replacement of many of its critical safety systems.

The first phase of this project (2007-2014) will consist of the replacement of the cooling tower, water cooled chiller systems and air cooled backup chiller system and seven additional sub-systems identified as UPS, Air Dryers, Confinement Doors, Criticality Alarms, Vault Water Tank, Glovebox Seismic, and Exhaust Stack. 

The second phase of this project (2014-TBD) consists of tasks for Fire System (4), HVAC (4), Roof, Elevator and Industrial Waste.

Specific information will be requested at a later date which will be announced on our Procurement Web Site:  http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/sup/procurement/.

LANL intends to award a Master Task Ordering Agreement.  Individual Task Orders for each sub-project will be released on a  Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee or Fixed-Price type basis to the successful offeror that best meets the Laboratory’s goals and objectives.

•&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;Safety Performance

The system shall be able to run the following third-party software which will be furnished by the Government during installation.



3.0	Delivery, Installation, and Acceptance

The Government will be partnering with contractors that support the daily operations of the ERDC MSRC throughout the delivery, installation, and acceptance process.

After award, the Offeror shall coordinate with the Government Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to ensure knowledge of, understanding of, and adherence to site security policies and procedures during delivery, installation, and acceptance. Offeror installation/support personnel visiting the ERDC MSRC site are required to be U.S. citizens.

3.1	Delivery

The Offeror is strongly encouraged to conduct a full-system burn-in and functional testing according to their standard quality assurance procedures prior to system shipment.

The Offeror shall ship the SVS onsite to the ERDC MSRC with prepaid shipping.  The Offeror shall unpack the system as shipped, assemble the SVS, power the system on, and boot the system to a functioning operating system.  At this point, the system will be considered delivered.

3.2	Installation

The Government desires to minimize, where appropriate and possible, the length of time between delivery and production use of the proposed system.  Accordingly, the Offeror shall permit access to and use of the system by designated ERDC MSRC Government and contractor personnel during installation and both prior to and during the Acceptance Test as described in paragraph 3.3.1.  The Government recognizes that such access/use needs to be explicitly coordinated with the Offeror in advance of access/use.

Beginning the first business day following delivery, the Offeror shall provide at least two consecutive business days of onsite installation support for the system.  This installation support will allow for operating system and software configuration changes in coordination with ERDC MSRC staff to ensure the system meets DoD HPCMP and ERDC MSRC configuration and security requirements.  During this time, ERDC MSRC staff will load Government furnished software on the system, including the software specified in 2.2.8 – 2.2.16, HPCMP Kerberos, HPCMP SSH (http://kirby.hpcmp.hpc.mil), and Platform FTA, in coordination with Offeror personnel.  ERDC MSRC staff will then run Government security scans on the system.  Once Government security scans have been run successfully as determined by ERDC MSRC security personnel, ERDC MSRC staff shall connect the system to the ERDC MSRC network.  At this point, the system will be considered installed.

Due to site security requirements, Offeror personnel will not be able to access the system once it is installed, i.e. connected to the ERDC MSRC network.
 
3.3	Acceptance

Beginning the first business day following installation, the Offeror and Government shall begin consecutive business days of onsite acceptance test demonstration for the system according to the following Acceptance Test definition.

3.3.1	Acceptance Test (AT)

The Acceptance Test Plan (ATP) is defined as the document, developed and submitted by the Offeror and approved by the Government, which defines the individual tests, test procedures, and expected test results which will be used to conduct the Acceptance Test.

The Acceptance Test (AT) is defined as the execution of the individual tests contained in the ATP by the Offeror and the Government or a designated Government agent, the results of which are recorded in a copy of the approved ATP and acknowledged by both the Offeror and Government in writing.

The Government expects the Offeror to develop the ATP without impact to the existing resources of the ERDC MSRC.  After award, the Offeror shall consult the COTR concerning any questions, coordination with ERDC MSRC staff, and planned activities at the ERDC MSRC.  The Offeror shall address all correspondence related to the ATP to the GSA Contracting Officer and COTR.

The purpose of the AT is two-fold:  to demonstrate that all components of the system can function as an inter-working system, and to verify that the inter-working system can meet minimum performance and functionality criteria defined in the ATP.

The Offeror shall submit the ATP to the Government (GSA Contracting Officer and COTR) no more than 30 calendar days after contract award and at least 21 calendar days prior to proposed system delivery.  The Government will acknowledge receipt, review the ATP document, and provide a consolidated set of comments as appropriate to the Offeror within 7 calendar days of acknowledged receipt of the draft.  The Offeror shall submit the final ATP to the Government (GSA Contracting Officer and COTR) for approval at least 7 calendar days prior to proposed system delivery.  In order for the AT to begin, the system must be installed (3.2) and a final version of the ATP must have been submitted to and approved by the Government in writing.

The system must successfully meet the requirements defined in the approved ATP in order for the Government to accept the system.

The AT shall begin no later than the first business day following installation and may last up to five consecutive business days.  The AT shall begin with the execution of the first test in the approved ATP.  ERDC MSRC staff will conduct the AT in coordination with Offeror personnel.  Due to site security requirements, ERDC MSRC staff members will perform the actual keystrokes required to execute the AT.  The Offeror and the Government or designated Government agent will visually inspect the results of each test procedure as it is executed.  Actual results will be compared to the expected results in order to verify completion of the tests.  Any supporting documentation, such as system logs, diagnostic messages, or application output, shall be submitted with the results of the tests.  During the AT, the Government may waive individual tests at its discretion.

In the event that the system does not successfully complete the AT within five consecutive business days of the commencement of the AT, the Offeror and the Government or Government’s agent shall determine the reason for the failure.  After correcting the failure in order to achieve a satisfactory result, which may require adding, substituting, or installing requisite hardware and/or software and performing services at no extra cost to the Government, the Offeror shall repeat the AT.  If corrections are required, ERDC MSRC staff will take the system off the ERDC MSRC network in order to allow the Offeror system access to make necessary corrections.  Once the Offeror has notified the Government that corrective actions are complete, ERDC MSRC staff will run security scans prior to reconnecting the system to the ERDC MSRC network.  The Government may, at its discretion, require the Offeror to repeat the AT in its entirety (including re-running tests previously passed) if it deems that the corrective actions taken to achieve a satisfactory result on a particular test necessitate that all tests be re-run.  If the Offeror has not successfully completed the AT within 30 consecutive calendar days of the initiation of testing, the Government may, at its discretion, refuse the system at no cost to the Government.  In this case, the Offeror shall be responsible for the cost of restoring the ERDC MSRC facility and systems to their pre-installation configuration to include removing the Offeror system from the site.

The Date of Acceptance shall be the date on which the system has successfully passed all tests (in a single or multiple AT periods, at the Government’s discretion) proposed in the approved ATP.

The Offeror shall prepare and submit DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, along with a copy of the signed/completed ATP and a complete bill of materials documenting the tested configuration (Offeror-delivered hardware and software) to the GSA Contracting Officer and Government COTR.  The Offeror shall include the following notes in section 16:

Scientific Visualization System (see attached bill of materials)
Date of Acceptance:  DD-MMM-YYYY

The COTR shall formally acknowledge acceptance and receipt of the system on the face of the DD Form 250 by signing and dating sections 21.b. and 22.  The Government will not make payment on the system without formal COTR acceptance and receipt as described.



4.0	Warranty and Maintenance

4.1	Warranty

The Offeror should offer comprehensive single-point-of contact support for the system (all Offeror-proposed hardware and software) and all support issues.

The system proposed should include a comprehensive four-year Offeror warranty (as opposed to factory warranties covering individual components) with 8x5 coverage, next-business-day parts, next-business-day on-site labor, and phone/e-mail support.  The four-year warranty should be quoted as a separate line item.

The warranty shall commence on the date of acceptance as specified on the referenced DD250.  Any maintenance services (to include parts replacement) performed prior to the end of warranty period shall be furnished at no cost to the Government.  Prior to the expiration of the warranty period, whenever equipment is shipped for mechanical replacement purposes, the Offeror shall bear all costs, including, but not limited to costs of packing, transportation, rigging, drayage and insurance. The warranty shall not apply to maintenance required due to the fault or negligence of the Government.

The Offeror shall include detailed terms and conditions describing the warranty offered.

Warranty services shall be provided by technically qualified personnel who meet ERDC MSRC site security requirements as appropriate.



4.2	Defective Parts Retention

Once accepted by the Government, parts that contain any data (non-volatile memory devices such as magnetic media, semiconductor devices, etc.) that become defective will be retained by the Government.  The Government, at its option, may permit degaussing and/or declassification of such devices in accordance with Government approved procedures for return to and re-use/disposal by the Offeror.  However, the Government reserves the right to retain these devices permanently or to destroy them, regardless of warranty or maintenance terms and conditions for these devices.  In all cases, the Government will retain failed hard drives.  The Government shall incur no incremental costs related to the retention of defective parts.

4.3	Software Maintenance

The Offeror should provide, either as part of the system warranty (4.1), or as four separately priced annual software maintenance options, maintenance for all Offeror-proposed software.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is seeking contractors that can provide the following services.  1.) Regional economic impact modeling application - A regional economic impact modeling application that estimates the effects of industry shocks on a county by county basis for all U.S. counties.

The application must be easy-to-use, web-based, and must be automatically updated as new data comes available. The underlying employment and earnings data must be no more than 6 months old at any point in time. It must use industry employment and earnings data detailed to the six-digit NAICS level. The industry employer universe must span nonfarm, farm, and government employers and be supplemented with private household employment and self-proprietors. Where original source data is suppressed for a county at a NAICS industry due to confidentiality restrictions, employment levels must be estimated. The application also must offer an easy means of examining county economic bases to the 6-digit NAICS industry employment level, evaluating employment trends from a recent base year (available from 2002 forward), and comparing county trends to national trends.  2.)  Historical county-level industry employment data (must be consistent with regional modeling impact application)  - We require the most timely, detailed, and complete industry employment data time series for each individual U.S. county dating from 1990 to the present. For analytical purposes, the data must match and be consistent with data in the chosen regional economic impact modeling application. The most recent data must be no more than 6 months old at any point in time. It must provide industry employment detail to the six-digit NAICS level. The employer universe must span nonfarm, farm, and government employers and be supplemented with private household employment and self-proprietors. Where original source data is suppressed for a county at a NAICS industry due to confidentiality restrictions, employment levels must be estimated. Employment data must be classified under NAICS for the entire time series.  Contractors capable of providing this service must submit convincing documentation of their ability to provide the services described above.  This information should be submitted to the Point of contact named below on/or before close of business Wednesday, August 30, 2006.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for electronic/written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded.  This is a request for information only.  The Social Security Administration’s (SSA) Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operation (OTSO) is seeking sources capable of providing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for a product that can encrypt data at rest in an Active Directory (AD) based, Windows Server 2003 environment.  Currently, SSA stores users’ individual and shared data on individual Windows Server 2003 file servers located at over 1,500 field offices.  Most of these devices also function as AD domain controllers and DNS servers, and OTSO does not desire to encrypt the operating system or Active Directory.  It is preferred to have the capability to integrate with AD for establishing access to files and folders.  The data types include documents created using standard COTS productivity tools, such as Microsoft Office, as well as proprietary applications developed by SSA.  The data also includes various database types, including Oracle and Microsoft SQL.   In some server configurations, data is stored in external disk arrays, or SANs.  Most of the Windows Server 2003 file servers in the SSA environment have the data residing on 3 separate partitions defined on an internal RAID-5 SCSI disk array.  Current estimates regarding the number of servers to be encrypted range from 1,475 to 4,200 pending the evaluation of data types and locations.  Separate groups will manage day-to-day operations versus encryption policies, so solutions which include separation of management tasks are desired.  The following specifications are the minimum mandatory requirements, but do not constitute all requirements: 1) COTS solution; 2) NOT a customized solution; 3) A Windows-based or web-based configuration and management tool; 4) Redundancy for key management; 5) Redundancy for continuation of operation in the event of a lost communication link to central office; 6) Capability and tools to encrypt existing data during a data migration; 7) Robust key archive and recovery; 8) Encryption of data on tape – or capability to backup encrypted data to tape using native Windows backup tools or Veritas Backup Exec; 9) No physical token or user intervention required for remote rebooting of systems; 10) Ability to restore encrypted data to an alternate device quickly; 11) Ability to control windows administrator access to data.  Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to clearly demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency requirements, above. Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered.  Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules, other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), or Open Market.  Pricing data is not required.  Respondents should refer to RFI-06-1011.  Only Electronic responses will be accepted and should be submitted by Monday, September 1, 2006.  Faxed information will not be accepted.  The size limitation for email attachments is 5 megabytes.  MS Word is the standard word processing software. A solicitation is not available; therefore, written and/ or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  Requests for information will not be honored. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact the Contracting Specialist listed below by e-mail.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  This is a Source Sought Synopsis announcement; a market survey for information only, to be used for prelimianry planning purposes.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.   NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL OR FAX.   OBJECTIVE:  The Air Force Health Facilities Division is responsible to the Air Force/Surgeon General as the program manager for initial outfitting of new and renovated medical facilities.  Additionally, the Division is responsible to the Major Commands (MA JCOMs) and the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) to provide guidance and direction for all aspects of initial outfitting.  With the increase in Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) responsibilities, our personnel deployment requirements, and resuction in authorizations, the Division must use contracted force enhancers to meet our mission.  This contract is to provide such force enhancement through contracted services.  The contracted services that we are looking to procure are from qualified national furni ture manufacturers.  The objective is to have a contractor provide turn key services to provide furniture, casegoods and furnishings for seventy-seven MTFs world-wide.  These services must include cradle to grave project management services, design service s, procurement of furniture and medical/clinical casegoods, warehousing capabilities, installation, inventory, warranty services and training on all new equipment/furniture.  The requirements would be based on a Comprehensive Interior Design package that a n Architect-Engineering firm would provide.  The products required includes (1) Furniture (2) Systems Furniture (3) Medical Casegoods (4) Artwork (including framing and installation).   The following are questions/concerns of the Government: (1) The contract should be world wide with no division between U.S. Regions and overseas. (2) The Government would like to have the flexibility to include furniture layout design services if we need them as we will not always be able to give them a CID.  Sometimes it will just be a floor plan and a finish design (SID).   (3) The Government would like to have the option to reconfigure, restore or replace existing furniture components. (4) The Government would want the ability to trade in existing furniture for credit. (5) Vendors would be responsible for providing training on all new equipment. (6) The Government would like industry input as to the best way to make this turn-key operation work. (7) The Government would like industry to suggest ways to issue a single task order for a mixture of furniture without running up against the barrier of dealer exclusive relationships. Faxed responses to this request are preferred and should be sent to Fax Number (817) 886-6403, ATTN: Diana Pickel.  Any email response to this request should be sent to diana.pickel@swf02.usace.army.mil.

<OFFADD>Other Defense Agencies, Missile Defense Agency, MDA Deputy for Contracting (MDA/CT), 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC, 20301-7100
<SUBJECT>R -- SETA Support
<DESC>The MDA intends to award, based on FAR Part 6.302-2, two sole source cost-plus-fixed fee contracts to incumbents Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Sparta, Inc. to provide for continued Scientific, Engineering, Technical Assistance (SETA) support to the Director, Systems Engineering and Integration, in the Washington, DC area during the transition to an MDA reengineered organization and the transfer of major systems engineering functions to Huntsville, AL.   Within two years, as transfer plans are finalized and facilities are made available, MDA intends to competitively award a contract for SETA support to MDA Systems Engineering in the Huntsville, AL and begin the phased move of work and government personnel from Washington, DC to Huntsville, AL.   MDA intends to complete the transfer of work within the five year period.  

These SETA bridge contracts will be for a base period of 1 year with four 1-year options.  As options are exercised, the SOW will be tailored to reduce the scope of work as responsibility is transferred to Huntsville, AL.  An initial level-of-effort (LOE) is approximately 80 Man-Year Equivalents (MYEs) and will be reduced by phases to approximately 20 MYEs to support system engineering work remaining in the Washington, DC area.   At the completion of the transition, MDA intends to competitively award a follow-on contract for SETA support in the Washington, DC area which will include the Systems Engineering functions relocated to MDA HQ, Ft Belvoir, VA.  

CSC and SPARTA are embedded members of a unique engineering entity referred to as the Missile Defense System Engineering Team (MDSET) National Team.  The MDSET consists of individuals from Industry (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics), Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) (Aerospace, MITRE, MIT/LL, Sandia NL), University Affiliated Research Centers (John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory), military and government civilian members.  The MDSET has evolved into a high performance team that efficiently draws upon the distinct expertise provided by each community of members.  Individuals of the two SETA contracts, CSC and SPARTA, are distributed throughout the MDSET and are integral parts of integrated government, contractor, and FFRDC teams.  These individuals provide highly specialized services, are not separable from other parts of the MDSET by function, role or skill level, and cannot be replaced without severe disruption to ongoing work and the smooth functioning of the MDSET.  The proposed acquisition strategy allows for a phased replacement of MDSET SETA members by supported functional area at a logical break point in the system engineering product cycle that will coincide with a preplanned transfer of the government team members to Huntsville, AL. All MDSET companies and individuals are required to sign non-disclosure agreements.  Companies must also sign Organizational Conflict of Interest/Disclosure forms to ensure they are able to render impartial assistance to the agency without an unfair competitive advantage or impaired objectivity.

IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/MNT has identified the Hewlett-Packard Desktop/Tower workstations and servers as key components of the Department’s network computing systems. Equipment listed above is required to provide network computing capabilities to existing Department of State’s enterprise network computing infrastructure based on existing networking computing equipment meeting the Department of State’s network security and compatibility requirements.  Time does not allow for changes in other salient systems due to configurations. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s network computing requirements. Numerous Hewlett-Packard equipment has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for Global IT Modernization (GITM) Program deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board (ITCCB).

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Instron Corporation, based on the authority granted by FAR Part 6.302-1, for the purchase of an Instron Advanced Video Extensometer for use on the FDA owned Instron Model 4465 Load Frame Universal Tester.

The Instron Advanced Video Extensometer will allow the automated testing of highly elastic barrier materials.  Current practice uses mechanical dividers to manually follow the elastic deformation during testing which is time consuming and is not as accurate as automated testing would be.  This is to support our glove testing in support of ASTM and CDRH glove expiration standards and guidance development.  This development includes laboratory testing of barrier materials for precision and bias data for the standards development process.
This system must be fully compatible with both of the FDA owned Instron load frames that FDA owns.   The compatibility allows training on one system to be applicable to training on the other.  It also allows for parts to be moved between systems in the event of a failure of one system for continued operation.  To our knowledge, there are no other sources offering an advanced long travel video extensometer that is fully integrated into this system.  

An award will be made in seven (7) days from the date of this notice. Sources may submit a quote, which fully demonstrate their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Alice.Pagan@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted. This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Thermo Electron for the purchase of a used Shandon Excelsior™ Tissue Processor demo unit, based on the authority granted by FAR Part 6.302-1; because of the its unique "In Process Rotation Management".  Thermo Electron Corporation Anatomical Pathology is the sole source manufacturer of this unique equipment.

Some of the special features of this unit are:

1.   Down Draft Fume Extraction around reaction chamber opening
2.   Automatic In-Process Rotation with enclosed “Never Pour”
reagent handling
3.   Specific Gravity Monitoring of Alcohol
4.   Battery back-up to complete processing runs
5.   Three distinct fill level options
6.   Automatic Underfill Recovery
7.   222 Cassette Capacity Organized (approximately 200 Cassette
Capacity Random)
8.   Dehydrant & Clearing Agent Pre-Heating area for rapid, more
consistent processing
9.   Five levels of contra-stir agitation to ensure processing quality
10. Vacuum Cycling
11. Temperature Control including Ambient
12. Remote Monitoring and Diagnostic Capabilities
13. Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) interface
14. Disc Drive to save quality control reports, event logs, and
program information
15. Two remote alarms available
16. 7 areas to make access code protected
17. Re-circulating (filters – formaldehyde & charcoal) or Vented
(Vent adaptor kit)
18. Enhanced Basket Design – Microwavable and built-in
displacement block
19.  Lid design is sloped to allow for removal of excess
condensation
20.  Glass lid provides visibility during processing.

Some of the safety features are:

1. Reduction of exposure to chemicals -Reagent bottles are in the back of the unit and fully enclosed. 
- The "In Process Reagent Rotation" system eliminates changing
of the reagents manually.  There is no more pouring or making up
solutions, therefore, greatly reducing exposure to handling of these
chemicals.  No bottles to empty and fill, the Excelsior uses the
original reagent containers that are sent directly to you from the
manufacturer.  Simply unscrew the cap and place on the Excelsior.  One
gallon of Xylene and one gallon of Alcohol and your rotation is
complete. 
- Reaction chamber has Downdraft Ventilation.  When the lid is
opened, the chamber automatically pulls a downdraft fume extraction for
reducing exposure to hazardous vapors when adding specimens after
process has started. 
- 3 filters total on the Excelsior.  Two in the front and one
in the back of the unit for fume control of formaldehyde, xylene and
alcohol. 
- An Extraction Duct Adapter Kit is available for venting into
a facility fume hood for further fume control. 
- The reagent storage area is built to a flammable cabinet
specifications.  Same specs as a normal flammable cabinet would be
built.
2.  Due to the specific gravity monitoring of the 1st alcohol for which
the "In Process Reagent Rotation" mechanism runs from, customers have
significantly reduced their reagent usage. 
- Safety reasons listed above. 
- Huge reagent cost savings because you are changing the
machine less often then before, therefore, extending the reagent life.
May cut costs up to 80%. 
- Reduction in tech time as well for not having to manually
change the machine and not being exposed to harsh chemicals.

An award will be made in seven (7) days from the date of this notice. Sources may submit a quote, which fully demonstrate their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Statement of Work

1.  General

English is an essential skill for workforce development.  USAID through its strategic plan, in particular with focus on competitiveness and workforce, is ideally suited to field test English as a Second Language Computer Based Learning (E-CBL) tools that may provide this critical job-skill for Sri Lankan youth from age eighteen to thirty, from all ethnicities and genders, particularly in rural areas. Sri Lankan employers often complain that they cannot obtain a workforce with the necessary job skills and new entrants to the workforce are frustrated that they cannot obtain decent jobs. Matching supply and demand is a core element of the USAID strategy, particularly in the Economic Growth program’s focus on workforce development. Learning English is no longer limited to ‘chalk and talk’ or radio instruction. With global affordable computerization and ‘Internetization,’ tools such as CD-ROM and the Internet have emerged to cost-effectively deliver English language instruction to the widest number of Sri Lankans. 

2.  Objectives

Provide the instructors/teachers of young adults with training to use supplemental English language instruction through English as a Second Language – Computer Based Learning (E-CBL). This program will be used to improve the overall English language proficiency of instructors so that they may better enable young adults to become competitive for jobs in the Sri Lankan workplace.

Deliver for young adult use an E-CBL instructional program that can be used in either a blended instructional setting or as a stand-alone for self study.

Travel to targeted sites in Sri Lanka to train teachers, IT staff and other participants to install and support software, as well as effectively use the software in blended English language instruction.

Report on the efficacy of the New Dynamic English, Dynamic Business English and Hospitality English training among the trained participants.  Indicate the need for adaptation of the software, teacher’s guide or teacher training upon assessment of the training using standard methods.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, Salt Lake City, Utah has a requirement for a Lands Records Research.  Proposed contract to include research and maintenance for final filing for specifically identified sections within the State of Utah. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this notice is RFQ JSQ064153.  STATEMENT OF WORK:  DESCRITPTION/SPECIFICATION/STATEMENT OF WORK 1.         BACKGROUND The BLM Utah State Office provides policy, liaison, assistance, and operational support for the management of approximately 22 million acres of BLM lands in Utah by 950 full time federal employees. The Utah BLM State Office Division of Land Records documents both ownership and use for all lands under the oversight and protection of the Federal government in Utah.  To accomplish its mission, BLM is currently undertaking a number of initiatives to improve public access and respond to public queries concerning the use and care of our public lands.  Significant effort is now required to evaluate land records, claims, patents and rights of way issues prior to digitizing the existing land record information.  In many cases there will be a need to quickly respond to queries, resolve complex claim and ownership issues and document decisions such as use and ownership now prominent as a result of FLPMA.  The deliverables under this contract will be provided to the Utah BLM State Office Division of Land and Minerals and Realty Branch, Branch Chief. 2.	       PURPOSE OF CONTRACT This contract is for land records research, maintenance and preparation for final filing, disposition and transfer as applicable for specifically identified Sections within the State of Utah.  Research, analysis and maintenance workload will be apportioned based on Meridian, Township, Range and Section.  Sections with the Township will define the specific work package, hereafter referred to as the Section Work Package.  Section Work Package will be provided to the contactor to review current issues, patents and claims using public land record information available using the LR-2000 System, and official records including Master Title Plats (MTP) and other plats, Historical Indices (HI) and Controlled Document Index (CDI).  Upon completion of the contractor's review, a final report outlining specific issue, findings and recommendations pertaining to the specific Section Work Package will be completed and provided to Utah BLM State Office Division of Lands and Minerals land and Realty Branch Chief, Additionally, in addition to the written report, the contractor must be prepared to respond to questions and brief any findings or recommendations made. 3.	           SCOPE OF CONTRACT Section Work Packages will be limited to only those packages found within the State of Utah.  Additionally, it is recognized that issues associated with the work necessary to evaluate Section Work Packages will vary based on the quality of  the records, information provided by claimants, previous rights-of-way decision, easements stipulation, conditions precedents and information and evidence provided when researching these Section Work Packages.  Therefore, the Branch Chief of the Utah BLM State Office Division of Land and Minerals and Realty Branch will review all Section Work Packages to classify them into one of three categories.  These categories and the basis for their classification is outlined in the deliverables section of the this SOW. In all cases, the contractor will be given access to the Utah State Office Public Room, BLM records staff and the official documents required including the Master Title Plats (MTP) and other plats, Historical indices (HI), and Controlled Document Index (CDI) microfiche media.  All information available from other sources (State, local individuals, Geospatial Data, maps etc.) pertinent to the analysis and review of the Section Work Packages will be made available to the contractor.  Based on the complexity and due date for final report/deliverable, it may be necessary for the contractor to have close interaction with the BLM staff to analyze key data components available through official records and make recommendations for appropriate action and delineation.  As Section Work Packages research, maintenance and preparations are completed, they will be evaluated to completeness and quality.  Occasionally complete Section Work Packages will be audited against official land records, Controlled Document Indices (CDI's), Historical Indexes (HI's) and Master Title Plats (MTP) held as official records for completeness. 4.                TASKS: The work to be completed involves the following: Record Maintenance - When preparing the Section Work Packages for final review, scanning and filing, the contractor may be required to perform manual drafting and automation work in the maintenance of Land Status Records which include notations of rights-of-ways, mining claims, lands actions, patents, withdrawals, surveys data and other public lands actions.  To prepare Section Work Packages for final assembly, the contractor is expected to communicate with Land staff, Adjudication Branch, and Field Offices to ensure information is complete prior to submission to the Utah BLM State Office Division of Lands and Realty Branch, Branch Chief.  Deliverables under the contract will adhere to current BLM standards for automation of Master Title Plats (MTP), Historical Index, Controlled Document Index (CDI) records, and survey plats and notes.  The contractor will not be required to research and will not be assigned Section Work Packages related to an Oil and Gas Sale or Lease. Informal Feedback - As required based on issues surfaced during review of Section Work Packages, it may be necessary for the contractor to work individually with State BLM employees to provide on-the-job training in the process required to evaluate Section Work Packages, records, including annotation and updates of BLM records, in a fashion which conforms to the process model directed as the initial deliverable under this tack.  In the preparation of the initial process model, the contractor will provide recommendations to assist in BLM's transition of Section Work Packages into the Land Record Modernization Improvement Program (LR-MIP) to supplement, maintain to replace plats and other records using automation. Quality Control - Ensures quality control of records products to ensure accurate records.

Monthly Reports - Monthly reports will be provided to document any issues or delays associated with record research and updating. 5.	 DELVERABLES: Analysis and research will be assigned based on the boundaries and limitations as described by Meridian, Township, Range, and Section.

<DESC>The following questions have been received and are provided for clarification to all interested parties. 1.  Under section called TASKS referred to &quot;vacancy announcement.&quot;&#160; Where is the vacancy announcement located?ANSWER:&#160; The agency will issue the vacancy announcements - these are what you are locating candidates to fill.  &#160; As part of our proposal may we or is the VA requesting that (offerors)&#160;submit resumes of candidates as identified in section called OBJECTIVE? ANSWER:&#160; No, we are requesting that you simply submit an explanation of the services you provide, a listing of clients with the positions staffed and your fee schedule.&#160;  &#160; The Posting Date is Aug 15 and the Response Date is Aug. 22.&#160; Do you anticipate an extension to this one week response time? ANSWER:No, as we are not looking for proposals but submission of your services (as you would provide to all in a commercial environment), past performance, and a listing of clients and positions placed and finally your fee structure.&#160; All of this information should be readily available The Solicitation mentions a SOO.&#160; Is there a link to the Statement of Objectives? ANSWER: No, the statement of objectives is a part of the synopsis.  The Solicitation states the first objective is to select one SES and two GS-15s.&#160; How many other government employee vacancies do you estimate the contractor will be required to assist with?&#160; ANSWER: That paragraph includes reference to the first immediate need.  The intent is to create an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quality) award.&#160; All staffing requirements are to be let on individual task orders.&#160; The first order is for 2 SES and 1 GS-15, my client is the Human Relations Department. Will the candidates to fill government positions come only from within the current government work force? ANSWER: Absolutely not.&#160; We are going out so that you can locate the best candidate pay and bonuses will be discussed during the oral presentations  How many contractor employees do you estimate will need to be recruited? ANSWER: Future plans indicate the possibility to fill between 10-15 SES's - GS-15 positions. How will the contractor be paid?&#160; The staffing industry generally is paid a fee for recruiting a candidate the customer hires, and labor rates for contractor employees provided.&#160; But the Solicitation mentions a selection and retention metric.&#160; What does this mean? ANSWER: The successful deliverable is a viable candidate.&#160; Some respondents will base their fees on retainer, some a percentage of salary after placement and some a combination.  We are looking for the industries response. The VA is also requiring that the vendors provide a session plan if their proposed candidate is terminated or resigns prematurely.  Will the task orders from this IDIQ contract include both recruiting tasks, and supplying contractor personnel to work in VA offices? ANSWER: No, as this award is being handled by Human Resources who do not participate in contractual staff augmentation.   You may however, offer more than one approach/service.  The Solicitation asks for one example of how the corporation responded when a project went off track.&#160; Would this mean, for example, if there were no candidates for the SES vacancy?&#160; A general example of what is expected in the proposal would be helpful. ANSWER:  That requirement will be addressed in the oral presentations and not in the original submission. Who is the incumbent or the company that has already done work related to this solicitation? ANSWER: There is no incumbent. Can you provide me a position description for each of the three positions? ANSWER:  No, this is an IDIQ and the specific information related to the first task order (three positions) will be provided prior to the oral presentation for those vendors who are invited to orals. If that is not available, can I get a brief description of responsibilities and size of organization managed and the budget managed. ANSWER:  Again, this information would be relative to the specific orders for placement assistance and would vary with the customers' requirements during the life of the award.

The purpose of this modification is to a) answer questions from proposed offerors; and b) incorporate the site visit questions and answers. a) Questions from Proposed Offerors: i. Are we allowed to bid if our product has a patent? What does it mean by 'Gov't must have ability to obtain an unrestricted license under DFARS Clause 252.227-7015' which states the Gov't shall have unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, etc.? Doe s that mean the Gov't 'owns' our submitted product and, with their own discretion, can have it reproduced by themselves or by someone else? Answer: The contractor may submit an offer, but if he does so, his price will be deemed to include a license to the gov't to use any of his proprietary data regarding the item to reprocure the item competitively in the future, and the contractor may not put any re strictive markings in his proposal that would in any way conflict with the granting of such a license. So, really the offeror doesn't have to do anything but submit a proposal and avoid restrictive markings.  His offered price would then include a license for the gov't to use his data to reprocure the item competitively in the future.   We don't 'own' the item or even the rights to the item or the data rights to the item. We merely then own an unrestricted license to use the offeror's data to reprocure the item in the future competitively--i.e, if the offeror does not win the future compe tition, another firm who does would have the right to manufacture the item using those data, but only under contract with the US Gov't. ii. Is there legal/official documentation (declaring patent indemnity) required with our submitted quote if our product has a patent?  Does a patent indemnity to the US Gov't allow another company to copy or use our patented product? Answer: These questions are in regards to patent indemnity and you must seek own legal advice. iii. Is the customer sure they want the product to pass California Tech Bulletin 133 Flammability requirements? This would significantly raise the cost. In the past the customer has only required the standard CAL 117 requirement. Answer:  New standards require the increase testing of California Tech Bulletin 133 or its equivalent for the furniture.  iv.  In reviewing the above listed solicitation we noticed in the requirements that 'all parts including the cushions except the main frame shall be interchangeable with the sofa's presently on hand'.  In order to be sure our product meets this requirement  we would like to know the manufacturer and the model number of the sofas that you currently use.  If you could please provide us with this information it would be a tremendous help. Answer: The specifications are generalized.  There is no manufacturer and model number.  The site visit was conducted to answer any questions on interchangeability. b) Questions from Site Visit: i. Does the sofa and chairs have to be exact fabric pattern? Answer:  Yes.  The fabric is Riverbed, color: Multi # 915101, grade 2, 100% Polyester  ii. Do all the pieces of the sofa have to be completely interchangeable with current inventory?  Answer:  No.  Interchangeability is required for size/dimension of all individual pieces, cushions and covers with current inventory.  Construction mechanisms/Main frame need not be interchangeable with current inventory.
