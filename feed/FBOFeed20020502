<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Diversity intends to procure on a non-competitive basis with the National Training Lab (NTL) Institute for Applied Behavioral Science to facilitate Survey Feedback Action (SFA) workgroup meetings for NOAA executives and managers.  The objective of SFA workgroup meetings is to identify and address understanding differences issues, behaviors, systems, policies and practices that are not inclusive and to work on ways to improve them.  NTL trainers are familiar with NOAA's organizational culture and have experience in working with NOAA leaders, as they conducted leadership training for NOAA executives and managers during the NOAA Diversity Network conference, and have conducted SFA Facilitator training for NOAA's in-house cadre of SFA Facilitators.  NTL trainers are uniquely qualified to facilitate SFA meetings because they understand the value that differences can bring to an organization's internal workings, and  have studied and shared these practices in their approach to individual, group, and organization change. NTL trainers are eminent practitioners and prominent experts in the areas of diversity, group theory, organizational development, personal growth and social change.  NTL's Human Interaction labs are the most popular, the most replicated, and the most effective programs offered for changing human attitudes and behaviors.  Their new applications of experiential learning have emerged to represent the most current and cutting edge programs in the fields of change management, human resources, organizational development, training, and diversity.  NTL's renowned Journal of Applied Behavioral Science contributes a body of knowledge to the field that increases understanding of change processes and outcomes; and the publication continues to grow in reputation and prestige around the world.  While other trainers have been considered, NTL is the only company with substantial technical expertise and experience to identify, understand and address issues of diversity tension, diversity conflict, attitudes and behaviors which surface during SFA meetings.  Any source that believes it can supply the required service shoulod respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirement, within 30 days of this notice, to the above address.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.

<DESC>On November,20, 2001 the Social Security Administration posted a sources sought synopsis to EPS/CBD for "Assistive Technology Hardware and Support Services" (Reference-Number-SSA-02-EWD-SSS). 

This posting (SSA-02-EWD-SSS-2) is to provide potential offerors with additional information on the Government's requirements. There are two files attached/uploaded to this posting.

The attached files are DRAFT copies of the Social Security Administration's anticipated statement of work document, and proposal evaluation criteria, addressing potential Agency requirements for technologies serving employees with disabilities (EWD). Potential offerors and interested parties are asked to closely review these documents and provide comments, questions, and requests for clarifications IN WRITING to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at: randall.pickwell@ssa.gov by C.O.B. 4/15/02. No other forms of correspondence regarding this matter will be accepted or acknowledged.

The Government seeks vendor community input to better focus and refine requirements, and streamline the any future procurement. Upon receipt and consideration of vendor comments, suggestions, and questions, the Contracting Officer will post responses in this forum. Any formal request for proposal issued following these responses to vendor inquiries will likely be based on a "total solution/turn-key" approach to meeting the Government's needs. Therefor, potential offerors are encouraged to explore the possibilities of partnering with other contractors to better address the Government's anticipated requirements. This posting, and the referenced attachments, DO NOT constitute a request for proposals, and are for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division plans to negotiate with Indra Sistemas on a sole source basis under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".   The contractor will be responsible for upgrading the AV-8B Radar Night Attack Weapons System Trainer (RNAWST), Devices 2F150C and 2F150B.  The upgrade will consist of the addition of the Litening II POD system. (Litening is an advanced airborne infrared targeting and navigation pod designed to improve both day and night attack capabilities.)  Currently, Indra is on contract for the 2F150C which is in development at their facility at this time and schedule to be deliver in December 2002.   Indra was also the contractor for the 2F150B located at MCAS Yuma, Arizona. A modification to the existing AV-8B 2F150C contract will be awarded as a result of this acquisition.  The period of performance for the upgrade on Device 2F150C would be 9 months and the period of performance for Device 2F150B would be 6 months.  With the Litening II Pod already in use by the AV-8B squadrons on both coasts, the ability to properly use the system is of utmost importance in today's environment of zero collateral damage.  Expediting Litening II Pod training in the simulator will increase operational effectiveness and increase safety while the pilots learn to incorporate the pod into their scan and cockpit tasking. Since Indra is the OEM of Device 2F150C, the development effort associated with this device can be greatly minimized by leveraging off the in-plant 2F150C development.  This expedites the entire process and greatly minimizes trainer down time to the fleet.   Therefore, any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government to the above address (Attn: Linda Sujansky) by 16 May 2002.  Company brochures and general marketing information should not be provided in response to this synopsis.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE pages.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) solicits proposals from organizations with the capability to establish a Pharmaceutical Services Support Center (PSSC) to deliver pharmaceutical services to HRSA grantees. HRSA defines targeted PSSC customers as HRSA grantees and 340B safety net providers, including community health networks and programs, state agencies, and organizations which HRSA grantees, Bureaus and Offices fund. HRSA requires performance in three major categories: (1) Information and Analysis, (2) Relationships and Networking, and (3) Program Development. (1) Information and Analysis-- a. Assist the Office of Pharmacy Affairs (OPA) in conducting policy and pharmacoeconomic analysis related to current and changing state and federal laws and regulations affecting the scope and delivery of pharmacy services, in general, and for the specific jurisdiction of the grantee, or HRSA program (HIV/AIDS, rural delivery systems, 340B). b. Assist the Agency in determining its role in the pharmacy benefit under Medicare and other national pharmacy services. c. Provide information, evaluation, and recommendations to community health networks and community development organizations concerning innovative approaches in all practice settings for affordable quality pharmaceutical services. d. Provide knowledge of best practices about collaborative efforts occurring nationwide that can be used to guide state and community efforts to encourage and form partnerships. e. Assess state pharmaceutical assistance programs, their structure and approaches. (2) Relationships and Networking--a. Provide networking opportunities with key pharmacy groups (e.g., providers and associations) to advance clinical and policy priorities for OPA and the grantees. b. Arrange for showcasing opportunities for successful OPA demonstrations. c. Develop partnerships with other clinical and organizational components to promote comprehensive pharmaceutical services that include the specialty areas of other partners.
d. Provide the schools and colleges of pharmacy with opportunities to develop internships and professional service projects that increase access to comprehensive pharmacy services, particularly those associated with HRSA grantees. e. Provide networking opportunities with state pharmacy leaders from both the professional associations and regulatory boards (e.g., a meeting designed jointly with the OPA to bring grantees and pharmacy leaders together for strategy development and problem identification).
(3) Program Development-a. Assess and make recommendations about various state strategies being used to make decisions about formularies, pharmacy benefits, and disease management programs. b. Provide relevant training for HRSA staff and grantees on the development and operations of formulary committees including their compositions, how formulary and coverage decisions are made, information needs, effective communication approaches, evidence base decision needs. c. Develop educational and training materials and other assistance in implementing systems to increase and to measure improved quality outcomes, reducing medication errors, assisting the Quality Center with the "eliminating disparities" breakthrough series (priority should be given to drugs used in the treatment of mental illness treated in a primary care setting and HIV-related issues). HRSA anticipates that this solicitation will result in a contract with a 12-month base period and four one-year options. The Contracting Officer will issue the solicitation on or about May 20 and close the solicitation on or about June 25, 2002. Interested parties may obtain the request for proposals from this site; the Contracting Officer has not issued hard copies. Regularly consult this site for any amendments.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design/Build contract with award fees for the design and construction of a medium security Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) to be located in Pollock, Louisiana.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to provide the new federal correctional facility.  The proposed institution is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a campus plan arrangement with related site development and site utilities.  The FCI will have a gross building area of approximately 56,000 square meters and be designed to house approximately 1,100 inmates.  The Design-Build Base contract award will be for design and schedule development services, and is anticipated for approximately late Summer of 2002.  The option for major construction is anticipated in late Fall 2002 and subject to funding availability for fiscal year 2003.   The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror, at a minimum, must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Louisiana.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, life safety, security electronics or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Louisiana to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors located within the State of Louisiana is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is also encouraged.   The successful offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about April 12, 2002.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, evaluation factors (Past Performance, Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Technical Approach) and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals  will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance, Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions, Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Management and Scheduling Approach, Small Business Subcontracting, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control) are significantly more important than price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.

Miller, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Construction Contracting Section, 320 First Street, NW, 500-6, Washington, DC 20534.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, plans to competitively procure the services and supplies required to design, develop, build, deploy, and support a system to record the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States.  The system, which will be known as the Entry Exit system, will meet a myriad of architectural, technical, business processes and legislative requirements, and will enable the Government to verify and record the identities of persons who enter and exit the United States by air, land, or sea.   Specifically, the system must enable the Government to establish the identity of individuals who intend to visit the United States; verify the identity of those individuals who enter the country, noting if they overstay the terms of their entry documents; and alert government personnel if the individuals are or become identified as national security threats. In that this will be a Government-wide system, the Entry Exit System will have to interface with multiple existing (and potentially future) Government and commercial industry databases. Primary Government users include Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, and Transportation.  Vendors will be required to demonstrate interoperability, scalability, security, and evolvability in an open architecture using generally accepted standards and commercial off the shelf (COTS) products to the maximum extent possible. The INS plans to competitively procure the design, development, build, deployment and sustainment of this system through the award of one or more open market indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts under which task orders (e.g., for design, prototype development, and system build) will be awarded on a firm fixed price basis to the maximum extent possible.  The contract(s) will be awarded competitively to the offerors who offer the best value to INS, price and other factors considered.  The INS plans to issue a formal Request for Proposals for the Entry Exit system in June 2002.  The solicitation will be available online. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed online.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up to date information about this acquisition.

<ARCHDATE>06162002
<CONTACT>Rhonda Chase, (757) 878-3766
<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), proposes to award a Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract, entitled “Full Rate Production for UH-60 Cockpit Airbag Systems” (CABS) to Simu la Safety Systems, Inc. (SSSI) 7822 South 46th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85044. The resultant contract will consist of a five-year IDIQ contract with no options.  The master IDIQ contract will contain an initial Delivery Order for a minimum quantity of 75 U H-60 CABS B-Kits to complete the fielding of the CABS for the UH-60L aircraft.  The maximum quantity of approximately 1260 B-Kits will be procured to complete the fielding of the CABS on the UH-60L and UH-60A aircraft to include spares. It is anticipated t hat the first Delivery Order will be executed concurrent with award of the master contract.  The CABS is a crash-activated, supplemental, inflatable aircrew restraint system designed to reduce head and upper torso injuries during survivable helicopter acci dents.   The CABS consists of an A-kit and a B-kit. The CABS A-kit consists of interconnection cables between the B-kit components and aircraft and the mounting hardware.   The CABS B-kit components include a software-programmable Electronic Crash Sensor U nit (ECSU) and two forward air bag modules and two lateral air bag modules with gas generators for each crew station.   The ECSU, the central control component of the system, is common to all CABS aircraft applications with programmable air bag deployment parameters specific to each platform. SSSI successfully completed the development, extensive qualification testing and integration of the UH-60A/L CABS which culminated in the Milestone Decision Authority’s approval to proceed with the production and deplo yment phase of CABS.  SSSI is the only known source with the unique capabilities to supply the qualified CABS. The Government did not acquire a detail design specification or a competitive technical data package inclusive of detailed manufacturing data for  another competitive source to manufacture the specific CABS developed and qualified by SSSI. Thus, any competing source will have to supply an independently originated design, which must meet the CABS performance specifications and the interface/interoper ability requirements of the ECSU for the Modernized aircraft fleet.  The CABS System Performance Specification, UH-60A/L CABS interface drawings, and the CABS ECSU Detail Performance Specification have been posted to the AATD web site:  http://www.aatd.eus tis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Acc_Announ.asp      Simula is the only available source; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All responsible sources may submi t an offer to the above listed address, which will be considered. Alpha Contracting methods with SSSI will be utilized.  A solicitation document is not available. Submit inquiries regarding this procurement  to: Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATT N:  AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Ms. Rhonda Chase), Lee Blvd, Building 401, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number is AE90901000 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.  FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be used.  NAICS code is 541922, Commercial Photography, with a size standard of $5M applies to this 100% small business set-aside. The Job Corps is a training program for youth ages 16 to 24 at time of enrollment. It is primarily residential with some non-residential components. The program provides free educational and vocational training, free housing in dormitories, work experience, counseling, basic health care and other support services. The mission of the program is to attract eligible young adults, teach them the skills they need to become employable and independent, and to place them in meaningful jobs, further education, or military service. Ultimately, the training should enable the students to become self-sufficient members of society who contribute to the community as taxpayers and good citizens. Job Corps intends to award a one-time purchase order for the services identified herein. Job Corps Region VI - Seattle seeks a contractor to photograph students, staff, and facilities at the following 11 Job Corps Center (JCC) sites: 1) Angell JCC, 335 N.E.

Simcoe JCC, 40 Abella Ln, White Swan, WA  98952; 7) Pivot JCC, 2508 NE Everett, Portland, OR 97232; 8) Springdale JCC, 31224 E Historic Columbia River Hwy,Troutdale, OR  97060; 9) Timber Lake JCC, 59868 E.

Our goal is to acquire a library of at least 100 quality photographs from each site, and our intent is to use these photos for a wide variety of media needs including brochures, the Regional web site, pre-movie "slide" advertising, point of purchase advertising displays, etc.  The chosen contractor will 1) Be a professional photographer with five or more years' experience with photographing people, events, and facilities; 2)Work with Regional Office contact to establish a shooting schedule no later than one week after contract is awarded; 3) Work with a Job Corps designated contact person at each Job Corps site during the photo sessions; 4) Use standard 35 millimeter color film, to be converted to transparencies, tifs and jpegs as described below; 5) Work from a checklist of required subject matter for photos. These photos will capture Job Corps students participating in academic classes, vocational training, recreational events (e.g. basketball or pool) and in residential areas. Most shots will be fairly close up and will focus on one or two individuals engaged in an activity rather than large groups. Photos should also capture exteriors of some key buildings at each Center. It is estimated that 80% of photos taken will have people as the subject, with 20% of the photos being of facilities. It is also estimated that half of the photos will be taken indoors (e.g. dorm rooms, classrooms) while half will be taken outdoors (e.g. vocational work sites, basketball court); 6) Spend no more than two eight hour days at each site, and may spend longer than that only with the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer; 7) Work with the Job Corps Center contact person to ensure that all persons photographed sign releases. Release forms will be provided by Job Corps; 8) Provide proofs to Regional Office contact after first shoot and receive approval before proceeding to additional Job Corps Centers; 9) Complete shooting at all Centers by July 31, 2002; 10) Provide all proofs for final approval to the Regional Office by August 16, 2002; 11) Provide final deliverables to the Regional Office no later than August 30, 2002 in the following formats: 2 1/4 transparencies, high resolution tiffs, and jpegs. Only one copy of the transparencies is needed. Twenty-five copies of the tifs and jpegs should be provided on CD ROM to the Regional Office. Transportation of deliverables will be FOB destination; 12) If a reshoot is required by the Contracting Officer the offeror will be reimbursed at the same fee rate as the original shoot and for all expenses. For any reshoot required because of an act of God or the fault of a third party, the offeror will charge no additional fee, but will be reimbursed for all expenses; 13) Allow Job Corps unlimited usage rights on all deliverables; and 14) Commercial interim payments will only be made for segments of work that have been approved by the Regional Office. Offerors must provide for evaluation at least five hard copy samples of prior work (which will be returned at the applicant's request), a description/resume' of past work, three client references, and soonest availability to do this work. Offerors must also include a price quote that covers the cost for all time, materials and usage rights. Usage right costs may be broken down by medium if desired. It is not necessary to include travel costs in the price quote. Costs for transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses incurred by the contractor will be subject to the federal travel regulations, see www.policyworks.gov. In the interests of time, the contractor has the choice of traveling by air versus automobile. Airfare shall be based upon the lowest available cost, coach or economy airfare.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Environmental and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and the Tax Division, have a continuing requirement for a contractor to provide various nonpersonal administrative support services such as copy, file, and supply room operations, scanning and faxing services, interbuilding mail messenger services, and copy machine maintenance.  The contract is available for use by all DOJ components, but its focus is on the ENRD and Tax Divisions.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing and supervising sufficient qualified staff (est. at 45-65 positions), providing and maintaining equipment, vehicles, and supplies, in order to successfully perform these tasks for ENRD and Tax at fixed unit prices per month, fixed price per piece, and on a labor hour (t&m), ID/IQ basis.  The predominant place of performance is the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with some staffing to be provided in Denver, CO, and copy machine maintenance to be provided in other cities such as Sacramento and San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and Anchorage, AK.  The anticipated period of performance is October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, with four additional option years available to extend the term of the contract through September 30, 2007.  The current contract (DOJ No. 97-C-0037) providing these services expires 09/30/2002 but may be extended if needed.  This RFP will be a "full and open" competition for a single contractor to provide the entirety of the requirements; accordingly any proposals to provide only parts of the requirements will not be considered.  No advance information or meetings regarding the RFP are available at this time - it is anticipated that the RFP will be uploaded to the EPS not later than June 5, 2002.  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 and large business offerors will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  However, this RFP requirement is not a set-aside of any type.

Over the past several months, the Department of State (DOS) has enhanced its ability to do workforce planning by developing analytical methodologies, processes, utilizing inter-related mathematical models that allow resource management analysts to systematically estimate Department staffing and readiness requirements for Foreign Service officers; estimate domestic staffing requirements for Foreign Service, civil service, contractor, and part-time, intermittent & temporary employees; and estimate Foreign Service promotion opportunities by simulating career flows, attrition, and ensuing personnel inventories that result from a set of Foreign Service HR policies.  Maintenance and enhancements of the models are also required to incorporate changes in personnel policies and directives.  LMI is the incumbent for development of the DSM and OSM.   LMI is uniquely qualified to continue these services due to their intimate knowledge of the project and expertise in Federal workforce planning and modeling.    No solicitation is available, and this notice is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within fifteen days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.  Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, US Department of State, Office of Acquisition, P.O. Box 9115, Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA  22219  (see Point of Contact below).   Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Department of State will proceed with the sole source negotiation with LMI.

             The 354th Maintenance Squadron currently operates and maintains two aircraft maintenance facilities that contain breathing air systems.  One of these facilities is building 1344, the Aircraft Fuel Systems Repair facility and the other is building 1348, the Aircraft Structural Maintenance Section.  Both facilities have practically identical breathing air systems, both of which are made by the same manufacturer.  There are some slight differences in volume of output, but none of these would affect servicing requirements.  These systems must be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round.  The contractor shall perform the following functions: 

2. SCOPE OF WORK

Item Description: The Defense Supply Center, Columbus (DSCC) will be issuing solicitations and subsequently awarding Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC) for a variety of initiatives listed below. PLEASE NOTE, we are providing to all interested parties all the NSNs to review and start pricing for the eight different categories. The purpose of this is to help the interested parties to get an advance start in gathering the necessary data in order to submit a completed solicitation. As a potential supplier of these items, it is imperative that you start reviewing these spreadsheets now so when the solicitation issues, you will be able to submit your offers in a timely manner. The solicitation packages and drawing bid sets will be available at a later date.

The method of contracting used for these items is an IQC. This is a long-term indefinite quantity contract. The contract term is for one year with the possibility of four option years. Although these items are solicited together they may result in split award contracts. The items on contract will be ordered within the minimum and maximum quantities or dollars, on an individual, as needed basis, by a delivery order (D.O.). The D.O. quantities are estimated based on previous and forecasted demands and the Government is obligated only to order the minimum quantity or dollar as specified in the solicitation/contract.

<DESC>The 311th Human Systems Program Office, (311 HSW/YA), Brooks AFB, Texas is preparing to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) program System Development & Demonstration with Production Options (SDD/Production) contract.  The draft RFP is located in the Files Link below. There are two areas within the draft RFP that are still under construction.  They are the cost arrangement for the production options and the strategy for oral presentations.  The draft RFP will be updated in these areas at a later date.  Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements thereto.  We anticipate a single award for the SDD/Production effort.  A small business set-aside is not considered appropriate for this program effort.  The SDD contract will feature cost-reimbursement contract type with a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) pricing arrangement. Production is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price options.  The estimates for SDD and the production options are $24 and $282 million respectively.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 336413.  The contract award will be based on full and open competition.  In order to maximize opportunities to all offerors, potential offerors were notified of program progress and given instructions how to optimize their potential for successful award of the SDD/Production competition.  On 9 May 01, the San Antonio RFP and Acquisition Highway (SARAH) and Commerce Business Daily Notice to Offerors posted information to all offerors, excluding the current Program Development and Risk Reduction (PDRR) contractors, that requested the following items by the listed dates in order to be a potential offeror for the SDD/Production contract: Funding documentation to support their pro-rata share of Government Testing - 30 Jun 01; System Design Information (Conceptual Drawings) - 30 Sept 01; 14 Test Samples each Material - 31 Oct 01 and 25 Prototypes - 30 Jan 02 . During SDD, the successful offeror will translate their design approach into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective design; validate the affordability and producibility of the system, prove the production processes; and demonstrate system performance to specifications through testing. The proposal evaluation will rely substantially on results of the prototype unit Government testing.  Therefore, offerors who were unable to submit their prototypes and their share of the Government test funds, will not meet minimum criteria in the selection process.  During the  next phase (SDD) the following activities will occur: Developmental Test &Evaluation (DT&E), man-rating, safe-to-fly certification, Operational Testing &Evaluation (OT&E), technical data development, provisioning of spare parts, Functional Configuration Audit (FCA), Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and Production Readiness Review. The Government will base its decision to enter production on the results of DT&E, OT&E, production readiness, and system affordability. Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) principles will be used to meet technical requirements at a price the user is willing to pay. Teaming or partnering within industry allows for the most promising technical design and expertise. Please indicate how teaming or partnering will be considered in your approach.  We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 17 Jun 02.  The RFP will be issued via the SARAH hompage internet address:  http://sara.brooks.af.mil (Click on 311 HSW Human Systems Program Office.  Find solicitation number - F41624-02-R-1007and click on it.  Scroll down to the bottom and click on the files link.)  Information concerning this acquisition will be updated at this location   Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this draft RFP require clarification in order to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing via e-mail to the POC.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. Michael Higgins at (937) 255-6005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Contracts Office (NAVFACCO), Port Hueneme, California, is reminding industry representatives of the study being performed at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) for Administrative Support Services.  In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 50 positions by the Office of Legislative Affairs on 23 January 2001, this action will comply with procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program.  Services involved will include visual media support, technical librarians, technical writers, administrative support, facilities (building management), and command security.  The functions being affected by this A-76 study are located in Port Hueneme, California, and Washington, DC.  A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by Government personnel to contractor performance is simultaneously being done.  A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by a factor equal to or greater than ten percent of the Government?s personnel cost.  Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified.  The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services.  Due to the type of work conducted in NFESC, it is required that contractor?s personnel be United States citizens.  Additionally, some of the functions involve working with top-secret information; therefore, the company and some of its personnel must have a top-secret clearance.  It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete the required study.  The expected term of the contract consists of an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A performance-based combination firm fixed price with indefinite quantity contract is anticipated.  The majority of work will fall within the fixed price category.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561110; size standard - $5,000,000.00.  This requirement will use a Best Value Source Selection process, and is reserved for companies in the Small Business Administration?s 8(a) Program using full and open competition with a 10% Price Evaluation Adjustment for Hubzone companies.  The solicitation will be posted in the SWDIV E-Sol website at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  A solicitation notice will be advertised on the FEDBIZOPS to identify when the solicitation will be released.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Delta-Sigma Inc. for the purchase of a Pegasus-2000N.  It is essential that the system be compatible with a previous prototype system. Maintainability, mean time to repair, data quality, data repeatability and data interfaces are all necessary factors to ensure the success of this on-going project.  The following specifications are required:  An RF amplifier to be used in a pulse Doppler radar wind profiler (RWP).  (RWP's are highly sensitive and operate similar to other Doppler radars.  They produce winds by capturing and averaging clear-air backscatter pulse energy {coded or non-coded}, directed nearly vertically, typically through the use of a ground-based planar coaxial-collinear antenna.)  The required salient features of the amplifier are:  
1)	Operate at a center frequency of 449 MHz with a -1 dB bandwidth of 10 MHz
2)	Produce 2kW peak power at its output port
3)	Operate at a duty cycle of up to 20%
4)	Operate with a pulse length of 0.4 to 30.0 microseconds
5)	Utilize RF input pulse rise/fall times of 1.0 to 100 nanoseconds
6)	Produce output pulse rise/fall times of no greater than 100 nanoseconds
7)	Utilize input RF power of +0.0 to +30.0 dBm
8)	Operate into any load impedance at any phase (to infinite VSWR) with automatic recovery
9)	Have a nominal input/output impedance of 50 ohms
10)	Produce no more than -60 dBc spurious content
11)	Produce no more than -50 dBc harmonic content
12)	Produce no more than -110 dBm per MHz interpulse spectral density

<DESC>NA This is a sole source contract to extend the existing Socorro Electric Cooperative distribution line, close to BEN Site, approximately 10 miles southeast to Pole 616 Site, following WSMR Range Road 7. The contractor shall supply three phase, 60 Hz, alterna ting current at 24.9-kV.  The Contractor shall follow the WSMR Environmental Office approved route staking plan (reference modification P00034 to Socorro Electric Cooperative contract DAAD07-70-C-0046) and as a part of the proposal submit raptor-safe desig ns for the new structures in accordance with 'Suggested Practices for Raptor Protection on Power Lines:  The State of the Art in 1996', published by the Edison Electric Institute.  The Government-connected load does not exceed 29-kVA at 208 vAC, three phas e (100 amp service).  The Contractor shall purchase and install a three phase transformer bank, fuses, switches, etc. to supply the TSN facility, 100-amp service, load.  The Government will be responsible for connecting the low side of the transformers.  I n accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 41.201(d)(1), Section 8093 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1988, P.L. 100-202, provides that none of the funds appropriated by the Act or any other Act with respect to any fiscal year by a ny department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, may be used for the purchase of electricity by the Government in any manner that is inconsistent with state law governing the providing of electric utility service, including state utility com mission rulings and electric utility franchises or service territories established pursuant to state statute, state regulation, or state-approved territorial agreements. In New Mexico, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission is constitutionally created  and is charged by the Legislature with regulating public utilities, telecommunications companies, and insurance companies to the extent necessary to provide just and reasonable rates and to assure reasonable, adequate and efficient service for the public.  The commission issues “Certification of Public Convenience and Necessity” for construction and operation of public utility plant or system. Socorro Electric Cooperative (SEC) has the franchise rights and authority to provide electric utility services in S ocorro County. These facility assets have accumulated under a number of contracts going back to 1958.  The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates rates and service of electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives, including SEC. The commiss ion has issued “Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity” to SEC, and only to SEC, to provide electric utility service in Socorro County, New Mexico.  Socorro Electric Cooperative (SEC) owns and services existing primary electrical power lines and equipment in this area.  Therefore SEC is the only organization capable of, and permitted to provide the required utility services in this area.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation number is RFQ-R8-02-13.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17.  The applicable North American Industry Classification is 325320; size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA-Forest Service is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item no. (1a) Glyphosate 4#/gal (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon containers (2 per box) 1160 gallons OR Item no. (1b) Glyphosate 5.4#/gal (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon containers (2 per box) 860 gallons or Item no.(1c) a mix of the 2 formulations yielding the equivalent poundage of ai.  Item no. (2) Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 1250 gallons (2.5 gallon container, 2 per box). Item no. (3) Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (Forestry 4 lb ai, (product specific; no substitutions)) 50 gallons (1 quart container; 4 per box).  Item no. (4) Arsenal (product specific; no substitutions) 75 gallons (2 lb ai, 1 quart container, 4 per box).  Item no.

(6) Garlon 4 (product specific; no substitutions) 1000 gallons (2.5 gallon containers, 2 per box).  Products 2-6 are product and packaging size specific; products are specific to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements, and package sizes are specific to meet desired storage and use safety standards.  While other products or packaging is available they are unacceptable due to either regulatory or safety constraints.  Products 1a and 1b are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Proposed wording for the bid would be Glyphosate as a solution in water without surfactant ? 4640 lbs ai as either 1160 gals of a 4lb ai / gal formulation or 860 gallons of a 5.4 lb ai/gal formulation (2.5 gal containers, 2 per box); must be labeled for forestry use.  Quoters may submit a bid on item 1a, lb or lc.  (Two listings are given to allow purchase of existing4# ai/gal stock but then move to the newer 5.4# ai/gal products).  Product specific EPA requires that products be labeled for site of application.  Any product purchased from this contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.  Quoters must provide products meeting this label constraints or product will be returned at quoters expense.  All quantities are estimated.  No obligation will exist until the Government places an order.  Orders will be made by credit card or purchase order.  Quoters must be set up to receive payments by credit card.  Orders placed against this contract must be delivered to one or combination of the following states:  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Period of performance is one (1) year from date of award.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors Commercial, applies without addenda.

<DESC>Contracting Point of Contact Mr. Alan Wall, Contract Manager, Phone 661-277-8592, Fax 661-275-7885, Email alan.wall@edwards.af.mil. Sources are sought to develop and integrate a Millimeter Wave RF (radio frequency) signal simulation capability into the Radio Frequency Generation and Injection (RFG&I) system developed by Amherst Systems, Raytheon, and Boeing. The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential offerors with the capability
of performing the proposed effort in Fiscal Year 2003. The current RFG&I system provides for the simulation of numerous radar and other RF signals in the 100 MHz to 18 GHz frequency range, with signal activity based on a computer simulation. Simulated signals are radiated into a free space environment using transmit amplifiers and elevated antennas. The current simulator models threat platform motion, threat emitter mode changes, signal pulse characteristics, and transmit antenna
scan modulations. A variety of signal modulation types are possible (e.g., amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, phase modulation). The RFG&I system is used in conjunction with an RF
monitoring system that allows characterization and identification of radiated signals. The scope of this activity is to extend the frequency range of the simulator to include the 30 to 40 GHz and 90 to 100 GHz millimeter wave bands. The resulting simulation capability will provide for radiating the same types of signals as are currently supported, in the above frequency bands. At least one radiation channel is required in each of these bands. The radiated signals in each band must be time correlated, on a pulse-by-pulse basis, with emitters in the other frequency bands. This upgrade activity will address upgrades to all facets of the system?s capabilities, including the ability to simulate emitters, generate correct RF signals, amplify and radiate signals into free space, and monitor the radiated signals. The expected technical effort includes: developing signal generation and amplification components in the applicable frequency ranges; assembling radiation components (e.g., moveable carts, masts and antennas); implementing upgraded calibration hardware and software; implementing all software, hardware, and firmware changes required to generate simulate signals and control system components; upgrading the existing monitoring capability to support the new frequency bands; installing and testing the system at Edwards AFB; and updating system documentation and drawings. Maximum integration with the existing simulator is required. Current system design information is limited, and access to documentation of certain components is not available due to the proprietary nature of documents and drawings.
Government furnished equipment will be provided as available; however, impacts to facility operations using existing equipment will be minimized. The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining how this procurement will be acquired. In order to determine if your company can perform the effort, given the constraints of
limited access to critical non-government owned specifications and drawings, we are requesting that each company provide a capability statement, past performance history of similar work, and other information deemed appropriate to assist the Government in making this determination. All documents may be faxed to Alan Wall at 661.275.7885 or mailed to the aforementioned address
by 2 July 2002. You may contact Alan Wall at 661.277.8592 if you have questions about this announcement. If we receive no definite information that other offerors can perform this work, this procurement will be advertised on a other than full and open competition basis. Please be advised of the following: This program will involve technology acquisitions that have military
applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) 	is seeking qualification statements from sources capable of delivering Hot box detectors.  Unless another qualified source is available it is anticipated that a sole source firm fixed price award will be made to GE Transportation System - Global Signaling. The required delivery date is September 2002.
As a part of the IDOT PTC (Illinois Department of Transportation Positive Train Control) project, FRA plans to acquire a high speed hot box detector to interface with a new train control system to be equipped in the Chicago, IL and St. Louis, MO rail corridor.  The hot box detector mounted on the base of the rail will detect overheated bearings in locomotives and freight cars when a train rolls by at a speed up to 150 mph.  This detector also has the ability to detect any dragging appurtenances detached from their connections to the freight cars.  The detector will automatically alert the train crew if any overheated bearing or dragging equipment is detected, so that the train will be stopped and the defective condition can be corrected before any hazard can be developed.  Necessary hardware and software will be an integral part of the detector system so that this new generation of detectors can communicate with the central office and the locomotives through the train control system using a pre-defined and existing message protocol as a basis of communication to a unit installed on the wayside of the track and the central office through a wireless communication network. The system needs to be a turnkey system, i.e. all the parts, except conduits, telephone lines and power cables, are to be supplied by the vendor.  Additional accessories to enable the device to perform more reliably, e.g. scanner heaters and train presence detection mechanism are to be provided by the vendor.  Non-volatile computer memory is required to store the data on 100,000 axles.  The data will include, but may not be limited to, train speed, direction, axle count of the train, defects found, axle number and side of the train with the defects.  Defects with dragging equipment will be logged also.  The results of the detection are expected to be broadcast and the data be sent instantaneously to the wayside unit described above as soon as the rear end of the train passes the scanner of the detector.  Any post processing after the rear end passes the detector will take less than 10 seconds.  The detector is expected to be highly reliable and will not initiate false alarms unnecessarily.  Software algorithm is to be employed to increase the reliability of detection by comparing the bearing temperature as compared to others of the train for any abnormal condition.  Necessary calibration and alignment equipment should be included in the proposal.  Engineering and other technical support is expected from the supplier throughout the installation process up to a successful completion with a fully functional unit.  Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualification by 2:00 p.m., on Thursday May 23, 2002.  Qualification statements shall be limited to 15 pages, including a description of organizational and individual knowledge as well as working experience with the aforementioned tasks.   Sufficient detail should be provided in the qualification statement to allow the agency to make a determination of whether the work can be performed by your company.   In addition to qualification statements, please submit Resumes of key personnel who would be assigned to manage and implement the required work.  Resumes shall be limited to 2 pages or less and will not be included in the 15 page limit.  Qualification statements may be submitted to the above address, fax number 202-493-6171 or e-mail to Sharon.Flowers@fra.dot.gov.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Joseph Langenderfer, Contracting Officer, null
<DESC>NA This is not a Notice of Solicitation.  The purpose of this announcement is to advise industry of a possible requirement currently being considered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  BACKGROUND – The VA Austin Automation Center (AAC), operates under authority of the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA), Public Law 103-356, dated 23 Oct 1994, as an Enterprise Center within the VA’s Franchise Fund.  Under the Franchise Fund, the AAC provides acquisition/contracting support for information technology (IT) and telecommunications requirements to VA customers, as well as to other Federal Agencies.  REQUIREMENTS – We are anticipating the need to establish additional contract capacity for IT support services for both VA and non-VA customers.  The support we anticipate includes, but is not limited to the following functional areas: 1) Installation, operations, maintenance and troubleshooting of computer network infrastructures, servers, storage devices and associated equipment; 2) mainframe processing support; 3) LAN/WAN implementation and integration; 4) information system security; 5) help desk support; 6) configuration control; 7) web design, development, installation, maintenance and update; 8) programming and system design; 9) telecommunication, connectivity and installation 10) independent validation and verification of developed modifications or enhancements to existing equipment or software; 11) input/output application database design; 12) technology refreshments/configuration reviews; 13) contingency operations implementation to include back-up power and mirrored site operations; 14) operate and maintain file/print services; 15) prototype design and implementation; 16) Computer systems facilities management and maintenance; 17) report processing; 18) strategic IT planning and assessment; 19) electronic commerce support; and 20) Software application design, development, and maintenance at all phases of the software life cycle.  We are unable to provide detailed information regarding the myriad of technical environments within which the above services may be required since this information will be customer specific.  Our goal is to establish a series of flexible, quick-reaction contract vehicles with firms that possess a high level of IT service capability at affordable prices and with favorable terms for our potential customers.  POSSIBLE CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS - We are considering conducting a competitive acquisition using the procedures delineated in FAR Part 15, leading to award of multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts where orders can be rapidly placed as they generate in the above functional areas.  For planning purposes, up to ten (10) contract awards are contemplated with individual ceiling amounts of $100 million over a 60-month contract life.  Specific requirements would be ordered as customers’ needs arise either on a firm fixed-price, time and material or labor hour basis, depending on the nature of the work.  The task orders may involve providing incidental hardware and software to complete the work where appropriate.  Task orders would be awarded in accordance with the procedures in FAR 16.505.  Work may be on-site at any government location or at a contractor facility.  The work is expected to involve secure networks, facilities and sensitive information; therefore stringent security requirements will be a part of any solicitation.  In addition, some or all Conflict of Interest (COI) provisions described in FAR 9.5 are expected to apply to this acquisition.   We are exploring the possibility of obtaining approval to issue these contracts as Government Wide Agency Contacts (GWAC).  If approval is granted, contractors will be responsible for accounting/reporting and remitting service fees to the AAC.  In summary, we are seeking highly qualified and competent IT firms to “partner” with the VA in a mutually beneficial relationship.  Although future IT requirements within the Federal Government are unknown, we anticipate our contractors’ ability to deliver high quality support on time and at favorable prices will make these contract vehicles attractive to potential customers and therefore, extremely active.  The ability to market to other agencies will play an important role in the volume of work ultimately ordered on these contracts.  Note: The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 513310 and the business size is 1500 employees.  ROAD AHEAD – We are in the preliminary stages of developing an acquisition strategy.  We anticipate conducting an industry conference in the May/June 2002 timeframe in the Austin area.  More information on this conference will be forthcoming as the situation develops.  To help us determine industry interest, capability and whether some of the proposed contracts can potentially be set-aside for small business concerns, interested firms are asked to submit a brief Capability Statement.  Respondents are asked to provide the following information: 1) Business status (i.e. woman-owned, minority owned, Native American, Services Disabled-Veteran owned, Hubzone, 8(a), Small Business or Large Business) in the NAICS code of 513310; 2) Overview of your technical capabilities in each of the above stated functional areas; 3) Description of relevant past 5 years of experience with each of the functional areas including the magnitude, complexity and criticality (i.e. number of users, equipment configurations, secure environments and multiple job locations, etc. without experiencing a contractor caused cost overrun); 4) Program Management to include ability to manage multiple tasks in a variety of different functional areas, working environments, locations and durations; how you plan to acquire and retain the necessary labor resources; your approach in establishing teaming/subcontracting arrangements for acquiring labor resources and to rapidly obtain incidental equipment; and your ability to meet schedules while assuring quality performance; and 5) A description of your firm’s implementation of the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998.  Capability statements should be limited to 35 pages and submitted by 14 June 2002 to VA Austin Automation Center, Attention: Joseph Langenderfer – Mail Stop 316, 1615 Woodward Street, Austin, TX 78772.  Address all technical and contract questions to Joseph Langenderfer, email address: Joseph.Langenderfer@mail.va.gov .  This announcement is based upon the best information available, may be subject to future modification, is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award of a contract or any other action.

The intent of the standardization program is to establish regionally preferred sources for hospital supply items to standardize purchasing of products for these MTF's. Clinical Product Teams (CPT) will evaluate this product line. Teams are composed of physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products. They will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted. TriCare Region 6, 7 and 8 deems the CPT member s to be medical experts. Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable. Companies interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item requirements. The y are as follows: 1.) Latex free. 2.) Does not contain di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). 3.) Macro and micro sets available. 4.) Universal spike for vented and non-vented use. 5.) Offers roller clamps or rate flow regulators. 6.)

<SUBJECT>A -- Acoustic health monitoring of tank cars using software based on
<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is seeking qualification statements from sources capable of evaluating the Guided Lamb Wave (GLW) approach of the Acoustic Emission Testing (AE) when applied to tank cars.  Unless another qualified source is available, it is anticipated that a sole source cost plus fixed fee award will be made to Physical Acoustic Corporation (PAC).  The period of performance will be 14 months from date of award.  This procurement requirement is to evaluate a refined AE inspection in its present state.  AE testing is considered a passive technique due to the fact that the sensors just "listen" and any sound that is detected is usually generated by a defect under load.  If a pulsar were to be added to the AE setup, the equipment being tested could be periodically pulsed to determine the state of the material between the pulsar and the AE receivers.  This form of active monitoring can be categorized as a GLW approach and is the basis of this sources sought notice.  The following tasks are to be performed.  Task 1 - Kick off meeting, Task 2 - Determine Sensitivity Requirements, Task 3 - Develop Inspection Standards, Task 4 - Data Collection, Task 5 - Data Analysis, Task 6 - Software Development Part I, Task 7 - Software Development Part II, Task 8 - Field Testing, Task 9 - Further Data Analysis, Task 10 - Demonstration & Evaluation.  Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualification by 2:00 p.m., on Wednesday June 1, 2002.  Qualification statements shall be limited to 15 pages, including a description of organizational and individual knowledge as well as working experience with the aforementioned tasks.  Sufficient detail should be provided in the qualification statement to allow FRA to make a determination of whether the work can be performed by your company.   In addition to qualification statements, please submit Resumes of key personnel who would be assigned to manage and implement the required work.  Resumes shall be limited to 2 pages or less and will not be included in the 15 page limit.

<SUBJECT>F--Lake Tahoe Basin Hazardous Fuel Reduction
<DESC>We are proposing to do a sole source service contract for fuels reduction work on the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit.  The proposed contract is an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract with a base year and four option years.  The intent of this contract is to accomplish stand treatments through the reduction of standing vegetation fuel ladders, tree thinning, and the removal of biomass and small sawlog material.  The North Shore Project Final Environmental Impact Statement and Ward Hazardous Fuels Reduction Environmental Assessment specifically require the use of a cut to length harvester to accomplish the project objectives.  This contract requires 1)a specific type of mechanical harvester to minimize disturbance impacts to soil and water quality resources as specified in the project's environmental documentation and 2) a self propelled chipper to reduce forest floor fuels.  The equipment consists of a cut to length harvester (CTL) with a log forwarder that minimizes impacts to soil resources by carrying products free of the ground while operating on a layer of slash.  The self propelled chipper is capable of chipping material up to 24" in diameter and would operate on the slash layer created by the CTL harvester.  The purpose of the chiper is to eliminate the need to burn piles which in turn would avoid smoke management issues adjacent to developed subdivisions.  Additionally, this equipment needs to be capable of completing all contract requirements in one operation minimizing multiple entries into the resource.  This work needs to be completed in a timely manner as specified under the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act and the objectives of the multi-agency Environmental Improvement Program underway to protect and enhance the Lake Tahoe ecosystem.

<SUBJECT>A -- NIAAA CRADA Opportunity to Further Develop DNA Melting Analysis Technology for the Detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphims
<DESC>The Laboratory of Neurogenetics (LNG), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) at the National Institutes of Health seeks a CRADA Collaborator.  The principal goal of this CRADA is to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of identifying gene variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  Because SNPs are present in large numbers in human populations (estimated at several million over the entire genome), they are likely to be retained because they are either genetically neutral or they confer survival advantages. However, when combined with other polymorphisms or environmental factors, SNPs may become low-level disease risk factors or disease modifiers.  An understanding of functional variations among groups of people is important to medicine for many reasons, including the design of more effective therapeutic drugs and a better understanding of drug side effects, a concept known as pharmacogenetics.
DNA melting analysis developed by LNG uses melting of DNA duplexes in solution to detect sequence variants.

POTENTIAL AREAS OF APPLICATION:

DNA melting analysis is a high throughput approach for detecting sequence variants in DNA. Due to the significance of gene variations in understanding disease progression and in rational drug design, the high throughput approach possible with LNG technology is likely to facilitate studies of therapeutic efficacy.  Pharmacogenomics studies have demonstrated that drugs show significant interindividual variation with regard to therapeutic efficacy. Traditionally the effectiveness and safety of a therapeutic drug is based on the results obtained form large clinical trials, which represent the average response of the study group. However, interindividual variation among the study subjects usually shows significant numbers of individuals with little or no response and significant numbers of individuals at the opposite end of the spectrum having dramatic responses.  Genetic factors contribute greatly to this variation in responses among groups of people.  It is likely that polymorphsims in genes encoding drug targets or enzymes involved in drug metabolism will positively or negatively affect individual drug responses.  The potential for more individualized therapy requires a greater understanding of the role of functional polymorphisms associated with drug responsiveness.  Thus, the DNA melting analysis technology developed by LNG offers the possibility of the rapid discovery of many more gene polymorphisms with benefit to individualized drug therapeutics. 

MAIN ADVANTAGES OF TECHNOLOGY/INVENTION: 

A number of methods rely indirectly on differences in melting temperature to detect gene variants, including SNPs.  One indirect method is denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).  In DGGE, double-stranded DNAs are moved by an electric field through an increasing gradient of a denaturing agent (e.g. a mixture of urea and formamide) in a gel at constant temperature until they "melt."  When the double stranded DNA fragments melt they undergo an abrupt decrease in mobility.  DNA melting analysis, as developed by LNG, is a non-gel-based fluorescence method that can detect previously undiscovered sequence variants with high throughput.  The method is based on direct measurement of the melting behavior of double stranded DNAs.  In addition, the method works for DNA fragments of differing lengths up to approximately 170 base pairs.  This method does not require prior knowledge of the SNP (or other variant, such as an insertion or deletion) sequence, does not require expensive oligonucleotide hybridization probes, and does not require modification of the primary sequence (i.e. introduction of a "GC clamp") to a PCR-generated amplicon to detect differences in melting behavior.  The method is easily automated using available equipment that permits simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples (for example, 96 samples in a standard 96-well plate).  Furthermore, all necessary reagents may be combined in a single step and the melting analysis may be repeated multiple times on a single sample to reduce statistical variation of the data.
