<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NetRatings, Inc. for a second year of service for professional services for the Web Evaluation Project. The contractor will provide NLM with access codes and any necessary reporting and access software, for online access to NetRatings reports and deliverables. NetRatings is uniquely qualified to provide an internet audience measurement service that includes drill down data on NIH.gov web sites. NLM staff reviewed the marketplace for providers of such Internet measurement services. NLM staff conducted searches of the web and consumer health information sites, and made inquiries of persons and organizations familiar with this market. NLM staff determined that NetRatings was the only vendor able to provide complete NIH.gov drill down data as an integral part of its basic Internet audience measurement service, compared to other Internet audience measurement vendors. Also, NetRatings uses a proprietary methodology and software that are not available from other vendors. Additionally, NLM requires that the drill down measurement data be compatible and consistent from year to year, and no other vendor could exactly replicate the NetRatings data formats. Finally, NetRatings has an established track record with NLM over the past year and offers continuity of service (with consistent drill down methodology, data analysis, and presentation). The period of performance will be for a base year with 4-one year optional periods. This service will be procured under FAR Part 12- Acquisition of Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available; however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above. Responses should demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the Government's requirements. Responses are required within 7 (seven) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM synopsis No. 05-175 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Tonitta L. Hopkins, Contract Specialist,(301) 496-6546 hopkinsto@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer,(301) 496-6546

<RESPDATE>090705
<ARCHDATE>12072005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Alison Shedd, Contract Officer, 617-494-2631
<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to solicit and negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Ohio University for “Prototype Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System High Performance Architecture Enhancements” in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302 under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Volpe Center, an agency of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), supports the modal administrations of the DOT through the conduct of engineering studies and research and development activities necessary to evaluate a nd improve transportation safety and performance. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Positive Train Control (PTC) system intends to utilize intelligent transportation technologies to aid human operators of the national railroad system in preventing accidents, while also increasing the capacity of the railroad network for both freight and passenger trains. In a step toward implementing PTC for the national railroad system, the FRA is evaluating the applicability of various technologies to enable PTC. The FRA, along with other Government agencies, is performing research to assess the feasibility of improving the accuracy of the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS), within the confines of the existing infrastructure for civilian land applications. The program goals  are to obtain accuracy levels of 2-5 cm for short baseline lengths (40 km) and accuracy levels of 10-20 cm nationwide. It is anticipated that high accuracy NDGPS will require additional data rate capabilities not provided within the current broadcast format. As a step toward the overall goal of centimeter-level NDGPS positioning in support of PTC, several error mitigation techniques must be investigated.  These error mitigation techniques may be common with, or enhance, other high accuracy Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) architectures that are currently under development by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), such as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS), and the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Ohio University is uniquely qualified to perform these services  because of its extensive knowledge and expertise in DGPS algorithm development. The skills that Ohio University has obtained in working on DGPS error mitigation algorithms with the FAA provides them with the unique ability to extend the algorithms from the FAA wide area and local area augmentation systems (WAAS and LAAS) to NDGPS in order to obtain the necessary accuracies to meet the requirement of 2-5 cm for Positive Train Control required by the FRA. Ohio University conducted Phase I of this effort (Contract No. DTRS57-04-C-10026) to define the NDGPS-HP architecture. In support of FRA PTC initiatives, the Volpe Center intends to procure the services of Ohio University to: 1) analyze NDGPS High Performance (NDGPS-HP) error mitigation techniques identified under Contract No. DTRS57-04-C- 10026 and assess the impact on and tradeoffs with other performance parameters such as integrity, continuity, and availability; 2) investigate enhancements to NDGPS-HP integrity, continuity, and availability which shall include investigating integrity monitoring in the form of accuracy indicators and monitoring approaches for the NDGPS-HP architecture for the identified error mitigation techniques; and 3) develop a dedicated user equipment test set for use in the NDGPS-HP test bed for evaluation in NDGPS-HP performance, and use the test set to demonstrate NDGPS-HP enhanced performance. The period of performance of the proposed contract will be six (6) months from the date of award. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330 and  the small business size standard is $4.0 million. This procurement will be conducted using in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Detailed specifications will be set forth in the solicitation.  Interested firms must submit a written capability statement to the above named point of contact providing clear and convincing evidence of the firms’ capability to provide the required services. Written capability statements must be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered. Such documentation will be utilized solely  for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. The Government will not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses received to the synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone calls made in place of the required documentation will not be accepted. The URL of the Volpe Center Acquisition Management Division home page is: http://www.volpe.dot.gov/procure/index.html

<DESC>The Los Angeles Air Force Base, Space and Missile Systems Center, 61st Contracting Squadron (61 CONS) intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed priced, services contract with ACCO Engineered Systems, 6565 San Fernando Road, Glendale, CA 91201-2214 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The contract will provide seamless support for the complex HVAC control system for the new System Acquisition Management Support Complex (SAMS). ACCO has been selected on the basis of their affiliation with the HVAC controller manufacturer, Automated Logic Corp. The HVAC designer is ACCO. This acquisition is between $100,000 and $250,000. The NAICS code is 238220. The small business size standard is $12.0M. This solicitation consists of one line item- Item 0001: 1 Lot; Commission, Test, and Air Balance HVAC System in Bldg 270 and Bldg 271. Project Description: The HVAC systems in B270 & B271is very complex.  The HVAC design is a combination of three systems.  One part provides massive regulated airflow to three floors, distributing bulk air throughout the building under the floor; another regulates airflow at the building perimeter; a third provides air through ducting to specific rooms or areas.  The air temperature of all three systems is controlled dynamically by real time computer monitoring and controls links to air valves, fans, water pumps, heaters and chillers.  To balance a system this complex requires a steep learning curve for someone other than the designer/installer, ACCO.  The HVAC controller manufacturer, Automated Logic Corp, provides specialized equipment to interface between the test monitoring laptop computer and the HVAC controller.  ACCO is the local distributor for ALC. The HVAC system is controlled by proprietary software.  The software must be linked with a network provided by the COMM Squadron upon completion of air balance testing.  The network is capable of monitoring buildings real time.   SAMS Monitoring data must be downloaded into an existing database that contains HVAC information for the Fitness Center and the CDC.  The use of control monitoring software other than that provided by ACCO cannot be guaranteed compatible in content and format when downloading. Changes to control setting and adjustments involve changes in computer code settings.   ACCO, as the system designer, is most familiar with B270 & B271 HVAC requirements, design goals and test strategies to accomplish those goals.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>This synopsis was previously synopsized on FedBizOpps under RFQ-OH-05-00188 (posted 8/10/05) as a sole source acquisition.  The Agency has reconsidered its acquisition approach and this requirement is now being pursued under full an open competition. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seeking a contractor to provide technical assistance for the ecological risk assessment, field oversight, and review of Federal Court directed deliverables associated with the Anniston PCBs Site. PCBs were produced at the former Monsanto plant (Facility) in Anniston, Alabama from 1929 through 1971.  Solutia Inc., the present Facility owner, was created in 1997 as a spin-off of Monsanto.  The U.S. EPA?s Environmental Response Team (ERT) has been sampling this site since 1999 and has found that PCBs have migrated away from the Facility as a result of surface water transport.  Solutia began sampling residential properties as specified in an agreement with EPA (the Time- Critical Removal Order) in May of 2001.   A Partial Consent Decree (PCD) for the Site was entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama on August 4, 2003. The Partial Consent Decree requires Solutia to continue work under the Time Critical Removal Order and begin a Non-Time Critical Removal (NTC) and a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS).  The NTC Removal Action is being used at the Anniston PCB Site to achieve immediate risk reduction on residential properties not addressed by the Time Critical Removal Order while the RI/FS is completed and the final remedy is selected. Within the PCD, the Court has outlined a schedule of the investigation and deliverables.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   Under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Shaw L. Yu, Professor Emeritus of the University of Virginia (UVA)  to conduct three international case studies employing best management practice (BMP) technology. These studies will collect necessary data and will test existing best management practice (BMP) technology analysis tools through international collaborative projects with Taiwan and China. Taiwan and China will contribute a significant amount of funding for the  contractor to conduct the tasks and accomplish the goals outlined in this SOW. There are three major tasks under the overall study. These are: Task 1.  A laboratory study, which will develop callus cells from cattail (a marsh plant) that may prove effective in reducing the pollutant load when  cultivated in wetlands where petroleum pollution is of major concern. Results will be useful in using constructed wetlands for the control of runoff pollution from petroleum sources. Task 2.  BMP pilot planning study in the Feitsui Reservoir Watershed near Taipei, Taiwan. The study will provide a  field test site for testing the BMP planning and placement tool developed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Urban Watershed Management Branch. Task 3.  A BMP treatment train implementation study at the Xikeng Reservoir in Shenzhen, China. The study will provide information on BMP  treatment train performance and its implementation potential at the watershed scale. During the past 15 years Dr. Shaw L. Yu has collaborated with colleagues in Taiwan and China on projects dealing with nonpoint pollution control and BMP testing. This relationship and his proven record of numerous  publications on BMP technology, plus the fact that he has already secured commitments from both Taiwan and China for significant matching funds designated for the BMP implementation projects as outlined in the statement of work, makes him uniquely qualified to perform the tasks of the proposed  project. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond.  Documentation must be received by September 8, 2005 in  order to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining  whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

Specifically, the hotel has meeting rooms of the size and with accessibility options needed by the board and sleeping rooms available on the dates needed by the board (September 12-15).  The hotel has the required number of accessible rooms and most importantly, accessible rooms with roll-in showers.  All sections of the hotel have been found to meet or exceed the Access Boards standards.  The hotel is centrally located for the participants with great access for individuals with disabilities.  Fifteen occupants are planned from September 12-15 for the meeting space and each a room.  Needs vary but include roll-in showers, hearing impaired, and guide dog services.

 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt-Administrative Resource Center will consider all affirmative responses received no later than September 1, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall reference ABA-02010-05-00XX and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be issued to Marriott Hotel and Resort, 775, 12th street NW Washington DC 20005 for these services.

BASIS FOR AWARD
This is a competitive best value combined synopsis/solicitation in which competing offerors past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price considerations.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:  (A) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price.  An offer’s proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item to confirm the extended amount for each.  (B) Next, the Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the certificates submitted by the lowest priced offerors (usually, the lowest 3 quotes) against the following evaluation factor: Certifications by American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American Council on Exercise (ACE), Aerobic and Fitness Association of America (AFAA) or Coopers Institute and certifications in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and first aid procedures. Certifications MUST be submitted with quote.  These certifications MUST be current.  (C) Using the past performance survey, the contracting officer shall review performance information provided on the lowest priced offerors (usually, the lowest 3 quotes) based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive an exceptional past performance rating.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror’s ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating “neutral” meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  (D) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  (E) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  (F) The Government intends to award a contract without discussionss with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to BAA 05-38 is to add the following security-related information. Barrier Reversibility: The Reversible Barrier Program (ReBar) is a new initiative by the DARPA Special Projects Office (SPO) to develop light-weight, quickly-deployable, and rapidly reversible barriers for both inside and outside use.  The basis for the final reversibility approach allowing US and allied forces to remove the barriers will be CLASSIFIED.  As such, all reversing mechanisms proposed – regardless of technology or methodology – must be submitted separately as an annex to the barrier technology proposal using the guidance detailed in DARPA SPO BAA 05-38 Reversible Barriers Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) Section 9.5 - Submission Process Collateral Classified Information.  The CLASSIFIED reversibility portion of the proposal will be no longer than 10 pages in length, and will not be counted against the Barrier proposal 20-page count. Foldouts are counted as a single page and must be no larger than 11 x 17 inches with no more than 3 foldouts allowed in the annex. Only the first 10 pages of Reversibility proposals will be evaluated. Proposals with fewer than the maximum number of pages are highly encouraged. Clarity in describing the work to be carried out will be used during the evaluation process as an important indicator of the ability of the proposer to plan and carry out the work.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is EXIM-05-Q-0039 and is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.

The following FAR clauses are incorporated herein by reference:

52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial
52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items
52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Or Executive          Orders – Commercial Items

Offerors are advised that they are required to submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with their offer.
 

The objective of the Mainframe Application Conversion Pilot Project is to investigate the feasibility of using automated methods and services to solve the business problem of converting the Bank’s mainframe-based, legacy, NATURAL/ADABAS applications to an alternative Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle environment.  To that end, the contractor that possesses this type of automated conversion technology will take one of our existing mainframe-based, NATURAL/ADABAS applications and to use their technology to produce a fully functional application using processes that could serve as a model for the complete conversion and implementation of NATURAL/ADABAS legacy applications to a Java/JSP/HTML/Oracle, web-enabled environment.  The delivered application is to capture and preserve the general functionality, business rules, business logic and operational integrity of the original application, while freeing us from the expensive and outdated technologies on which these critical IT assets were originally built.  The delivered application should also be sustainable without requiring the availability of the contractor that performs the conversion.  During this pilot project, the Contractor will be expected to demonstrate the viability, reliability and efficiency of their automated conversion solution.  In addition, the Contractor will be asked to use their experience with conversion of the selected system and information provided to them on our other existing mainframe-based systems to estimate (non-binding) the cost and time that are reasonable for the replacement of the remainder of those systems.

The selected contractor will be asked to:
1.	Compare available application server environments and provide the Bank with recommendations on which HW/SW platform we should use for the converted application.
2.	Perform the conversion of one of our small mainframe-based applications in a relatively short time frame and assist in deploying the converted system in the selected test environment.  Additional data fields and tables will be added to the database for future enhancements.
3.	Make corrections to the application during the testing period and until completion of the quality assurance phase where we have verified that it performs exactly the way the mainframe-based application did.
4.	Provide limited (about 120 hours) of consulting services for enhancements/added limited functionality to the converted applications.
5.	Analyze our other mainframe applications and provide us with a non-binding estimate of both the cost and time it would take to migrate the remainder of our mainframe-based applications into our new environment.

PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT THEIR OFFERS ELECTRONICALLY OR VIA FAX. IF HARD COPY IS TO BE SUBMITTED, YOU ARE ADVISED TO USE A COURIER SERVICE IN LIEU OF THE U.S. MAIL, DUE TO THE TIME LAG ASSOCIATED WITH MAIL SERVICE.

 For aircraft that currently have armored Paratroop doors, do you want the PDPs armored for those aircraft? Yes, and if  possible use existing door armor.

It does not appear that the PDP angles should be the same as the CDP angles especially ‘between the 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock continuum behind the aircraft”.  Please recheck the PDP viewing requirement.  This is the best case scenario that we where hoping for please summit your best estimate of what you feel is a going to be the real viewing capability for us to evaluate.

It appears that the government wants the contractor to provide any requisite Gp A and Gp B defensive systems (flare & chaff) dispense capability (assuming the aircraft is equipped with the applicable systems) AND oxygen and life support systems at the CDP.  Is this correct?  Does this include AERP?  Does this include interphone capability (receive & transmit)?  Does this include power for use of NVGs?  We assume yes to all the above, is our interpretation correct?  Yes

Is removal of the CDP for airdrops an alternative? Yes, as long as it is removable  in flight

Do you want all PDPs armored, or only those PDPs to be installed in aircraft? All PDPs are to be armored, although it was the government’s intent that the paratroop door be used for this.

Are drawings available?  Drawings are not available at this time. 

Also,  the response due date has been extended to COB 30 Aug 05. 
 
Also, to answer FAA Certification question.  It was inadvertently placed in the RFI.  There is only the Air Worthiness requirement IAW MIL-HDBK-516.

<DESC>ALEP Block 2 program.  
 This RFI is divided into sections so that you may answer those questions that pertain to your area of expertise or interest.  Any proprietary information you provide will be safeguarded and will not be divulged to other potential offerors.   

All Contractors:
1. Is your company submitting its response as the prime “integration” contractor or a sub-contractor?
Request for Information (RFI)
for the
Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2

 This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This “Request for Information” is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  We intend to follow this RFI with the release of a draft RFP for industry comment.  A Statement of Objectives is attached.  Performance Specifications are currently being developed.  If a copy of the Performance Specification is needed for estimating purposes contact Juan Villarreal at 210-536-4907 or juan.villarreal@brooks.af.mil and a draft copy will be sentd.   
 The ALEP Block 2 device will protect against 7 laser wavelengths (4 in the visible spectrum and 3 in the invisible spectrum).  The device will provide peripheral protection, be compatible with life support equipment (LSE) and aircraft cockpits/cabins, be suitable for both day and night operation without adversely affecting mission capability or safety of flight, and accommodate vision correction.  Refer to the Statement of Objectives for more insight on the
2. What experience do you have with integrating eyewear/visors with aircraft cockpits/cabins and displays, LSE (Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) equipment, helmet mounted displays, oxygen masks, helmets, night vision goggles, etc.), and the Air Force maintenance/logistics system?

3. Briefly describe any past or present manufacturing experience your company has that is relevant to the type of product you envision developing to meet this requirement.  Also, describe your current and/or future production capability.

4. What is the most efficient approach (excluding contact lenses and eye surgery) for providing vision correction along with laser eye protection in the Block 2 device?

5. Do you have experience in working with Government Test Agencies or Laboratories?  If so, describe those efforts, the time frame, and the specific Government agencies involved.

Integration Contractors:
1. How much experience do you have as a prime integrator for laser eye protection products?  (e.g., Integrating laser eye protection technologies (absorptive, reflective, etc) with lenses, frames, and visors, performing analysis of the design, and testing the final product.)

2. Identify the risks associated with executing the ALEP Block 2 Concept and Technology Development (C&TD) effort.  What are the mitigation plans for those risks?

3. What would you estimate the period of performance and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for the ALEP Block 2 C&TD effort?

4. Identify the risks associated with executing the ALEP Block 2 Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort.  What are the mitigation plans for those risks?

5. What would you estimate the period of performance and a ROM cost for the ALEP Block 2 SDD phase?

6. In a Cost-Plus Incentive Fee contract, what incentives would interest you?  Do you anticipate any risks with this type of contract?  If so, what are the risks?

Filter/Dye Contractors:
1. What wavelength(s)/wavelength range(s) are you capable of protecting against and using what technology?

2. Can you design laser absorptive dyes with high photopic luminance transmission in both the visible and invisible wavelength spectrum?  What percent transmissions can you achieve and at what wavelength(s) and optical density?

3. How would you protect the sides of the eyeball from laser strikes without hindering peripheral vision but still providing laser eye protection?  What is the maximum face form angle you can provide with laser eye protection, side protection, and LSE compatibility?

4. For laminated lenses/visors, what temperature and humidity ranges can your product survive?

5. Are you able to provide non-dye laser protection on a non-laminated (single piece) lens/visor?  If so, do you have a sufficiently durable hard-coat that would protect the laser protection filter?  What temperature and humidity ranges can your non-laminated product survive?

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous notice is to address additional questions that have been submitted. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this information. Information regarding the network architecture topology is available as two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

Question: In order to better understand and respond, could you please provide further detail into the following: network architecture topology; elaboration on the development environment (number of users, platforms, software and versions, etc.); and existing databases within the architecture to include: quantity within the network, vendor and database version for each location, primary application/functionality (financial, logistics, etc.), current and anticipated growth in size database size for each location, and current anticipated growth in users/queries for each location number of users for each location. Would the Government consider products other than Oracle 10g and Solaris that met and/or exceeded these requirements?

Response:

1) Additional Overview comments: The Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) is the central registry for all Operational Units in the Department of Defense. It is the single automated reporting system within DoD that provides the senior leadership with authoritative identification, location, assignment, personnel, and equipment data. It contains the condition and level of resources and training and the Commander's assessment of how the status of his/her resources and training levels affect the Unit's readiness status. Units report by exception with 24 hours of a change and submit validation reports if no changes occur within 30 days.

2) Network architecture topology: See two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

3) Elaboration on development environment: Force Readiness is split into three categories, as follows: the Readiness Assessment System Input Tool, the SORTS database, and the Readiness Assessment System Output Tool. Development activities are conducted at the current vendor's facility and the DISA Skyline laboratory, with testing occurring at the DISA Skyline laboratory and the Engineering/Integration suite at Northrop-Grumman. Currently, the Force Readiness architecture resides on Sun Fire V440 servers, hoping to move to Sun Fire V890 Servers. In February, SORTS released Version 4.0.2 and will be releasing Version 4.0.3 in October.

4) Quantity of databases within the network: The architecture contains two primary databases, the SORTS master database (containing current readiness data) and the Historical database (containing historical readiness data). The subcomponents of these databases are shown in the two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

5) Vendor and database version: The incumbent contractor has been previously identified in Modification 01. The Readiness Assessment System Input Tool and the SORTS database are on Version 4.0.3 and the Readiness Assessment Output Tool is on Version Global 4.0.1.

6) Primary application/functionality: described in overview statement above (statement 1).

7) Database location: The database serves the readiness reporting needs of Joint Staff, all Military Services (including Coast Guard), and all Combatant Commands. In performing this support, the SORTS master database is distributed by means of local GORAs (Global SORTS Oracle Client Database) to 39 locations worldwide. The User pool should remain relatively constant as we move into Block V.

8) Architecture Issues: Force Readiness is a "system within a system." It belongs to a family of command and control mission applications (to include COP, I3, SORTS, JOPES, etc.) based upon a Common Operational Environment established by the GCCS-J Systems Engineer. In order to stay consistent throughout the architecture, it is necessary for all mission applications to remain on the same architectural base - for Block V this will be Oracle 10g and Solaris 10. At this time, Force Readiness will not be allowed to move off of this baseline.

Respondents are reminded the date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

<CONTACT>Leslie Leavitt Purchasing Agent 7022938642 lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Associated Cultural Resource Experts, LLC (ACRE), 8341 Sangre de Cristo Road, Suite 202, Littleton, Colorado 80127.  This purchase order is a follow-on contract for the continuation of the documentation and evaluation work initiated under Purchase Order 04PG303310.  For several years ACRE worked under a cooperative agreement between Western Area Power Administration (Western) and Reclamation to document historic resources associated with Hoover Dam.  ACRE has also worked for the Federal Highways Administration, the Nevada Department of Transportation, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area on a number of projects in the vicinity of Hoover Dam and Boulder City.  Most recently ACRE was issued a contract by Reclamation (04PG303310) for the identification and documentation of cultural resources located in the Security Zone surrounding Hoover Dam.  Task 7 of that contract was for the survey, evaluation and HABS/HAER documentation of the Old Exhibit Building.  As a part of these previous projects, ACRE has conducted extensive archival research and field work leading to the identification of numerous facilities and elements  of the historic infrastructure associated with the construction and operation of Hoover Dam.  As a part of these earlier projects, ACRE has consulted with the NSHPO and ASHPO, the Landmarks Program, and the National Park Service, Historic Engineering Records (HAER) Program on the procedures and levels of documentation required by those offices and programs.  Reclamation will save time and money by contracting with ACRE for this work because ACRE has already completed extensive background research on Hoover Dam and numerous associated resources.  ACRE has completed background research on the Old Exhibit Building as a part of the survey, evaluation and HABS/HAER documenation task identified in Contract 04PG303310.  Much of the information contained in ACRE's 2005 report, Survey and Historical Evaluation of the Hoover Dam Old Exhibit Building (26CK7113) Clark County, Nevada and the Draft HABS/HAER document, including the construction history, historic fabric identifications, diagrams and engineering drawings, and HABS/HAER quality photographs, which are also required elements of HSR.  ACRE already has this material in hand and can thus integrate it directly into the Historic Structures Repors (HSR), substantially lowering the cost to Reclamation for preparation of the HSR.  It is considered to be in the best interests of the Government to award a purchase order to ACRE.  This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is September 6, 2005.  You may contact Leslie Leavitt at (702) 293-8642 or lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov for questions.

<DESC>This is a sources sought for any item meeting the following specifications -- of which there is currently one known source: A #2 polyethylene container, cylinder in shape, measureing 11.75 inches tall and 8.2 inches in diameter and sturdy enough to be sat on when in use.  It is designed to hold 1.86 gallons of human waste and has a DOT approved two way vent to release gases throught he screw down lid.  The unit was originally designed with a disposable foam ring that works as a seat, but this new design/version has elimated the ring for easier cleaning.  It is designed to have its contents dumped directly out and then rinsed for final cleaning.  The new designe will allow this unit to be cleaned in a SCAT Machine (which is a portable toilet washer) and approved by the Alaska Public Health Consultant.  The container is tested to withstand five four-foot drops onto concrete at zero degrees F with it 3/4 full of frozen ice at a temperature of zero degrees.  It comes with a harness system that can lock the lid down and is sturdy enough to strap on a pack or sled. If you have a commercial product that can meet these specifications, contact Teri Hudgins at 907-644-3306.

<DESC>Robotic Lunar Exploration Program Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Communication System, High Gain Antenna Request for Information THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. Overview LRO requires communications to support tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) as well as high-rate mission measurement data return.  Part of this system includes a dual-band S-/Ka-band High Gain Antenna (HGA). LRO will employ a single HGA which is deployed on a boom and pointed with an X/Y gimbal. The expected scope of work includes the mechanical/structural/thermal design, development, fabrication, assembly, testing and qualification, evaluation, and delivery of two (2) space flight qualified HGAs – one protoflight, one flight. The existing RF design has been translated into mechanical requirements. The HGA is comprised of: (1) a reflector assembly, which includes a 75 cm diameter main reflector and a 13 cm diameter subreflector, supported by nominally three struts; and, (2) a Ka-band feed horn assembly, and (3) an S-band feed and cable assembly. Items (2) and (3) will be supplied as Government Furnished Equipment. The entire HGA assembly is mounted to a common interface mounting plate. The reflectors are similar to a classic conic Cassegrain design with a focal-to-diameter ratio (F/D) of about 0.3, but are slightly shaped to maximize the RF peak gain. The Cassegrain configuration is used at Ka-band, while a prime feed configuration is used at S-band. This is enabled through a frequency selective surface (FSS) subreflector, allowing the S-band feed to be mounted above the subreflector and radiate through to the main reflector. The electrical interfaces presented by the HGA will be a WR-34 waveguide for Ka-band, and coaxial cable for S-band. The coaxial cable will have to be routed from the interface plate to the S-band feed. The reflector surfaces will be mathematically defined using cubic splines. A definition of the strut configuration will be made, with alternatives accepted pending government analysis and approval such that RF performance is not significantly affected by the blockage and diffraction. The FSS design will be specified through guidance on the composite subreflector material properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent) and a metallized pattern definition (a DXF file for a flattened surface can also be provided). The HGA will be expected to maintain performance after being subjected to the launch environment of a TBD launch vehicle, and as it experiences thermal extremes while it orbits the moon throughout all beta angles.  Requested Response The LRO mission requests that interested parties provide inputs and suggestions as to how best to achieve the HGA development for the LRO mission.   Since cost and schedule are discriminators in LRO’s eventual selection of any solution, the project is mostly interested with responses that closely match or exceed LRO’s assumed requirements; however, the project is very interested in learning of potential technology developments that could benefit LRO, RLEP and the Agency.   In addition to the general topics discussed above, the LRO mission requests the following: 1.	Discuss a minimum-cost, minimum-risk method of achieving the HGA goals of LRO. Discuss the proposed architecture and components. Provide ROM estimates for procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO. Specific cost drivers should be identified to ensure a balanced approach to performance and cost. Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, and mass requirements of this solution. 2.	Describe options to fabricate the FSS subreflector. 3.	Describe strut configuration options to support the subreflector and S-band feed, and incorporate the coaxial cable, assuming a 0.5 cm diameter cable, weighing 16 g/ft with a 2.5 cm minimum bend radius. Assume the S-band feed is a cylindrical box, 10 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm thick, mounted above the subreflector. 4.	Discuss any other methods, options or technologies you believe of benefit to the LRO and RLEP programs. Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information.  Information submitted in response to this Request for Information will be used for LRO and RLEP concept development activities.  Parties proposing concepts of interest to LRO and RLEP may be invited to submit more detailed information or to discuss their concepts further. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Jason Soloff at (301) 286-1368 or Jason.A.Soloff@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov. Interested offerors shall address the requirements of this RFI in written format as described in the previous paragraphs by electronic mail to: Jason Soloff at Jason.A.Soloff@nasa.gov, no later than 5:00 PM EST on September 23, 2005.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with LaRC Investigators in developing proposals addressing the goals and objectives for a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the Earth Systems Science Pathfinder Program (ESSP) to be released sometime within the next fiscal year, leveraging LaRC's core competencies in Atmospheric Sciences, Laser/Lidar remote sensing, and passive remote sensing.  The ESSP program is a component of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA that addresses unique, specific, highly-focused mission requirements in Earth-Sun System research (see  http://science.hq.nasa.gov/index.html ). The ESSP program is an innovative approach for addressing Earth science research by providing periodic "Windows of Opportunity" to accommodate new scientific priorities and infuse new scientific participation into the Earth-Sun Directorate. The ESSP selection is a two step process.  (Note: Step 1 proposals originally due in June 2005 have been delayed.  Refer to the official website at  http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/essp/schedule4.html  for the latest updates.)    There will be no exchange of funds between the partners during the proposal preparation period.   Contract awards are anticipated subject to the availability of funds should the ESSP mission proposal be selected.  Proposals selected in Step 2 will be funded to perform Phase A concept studies leading up to the submission of a proposal in which the entire end-to-end mission life cycle will be detailed.  Teaming offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC	 It is expected that the selected teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal development process, and that selection of the proposal for mission implementation would result in contract(s) for the selected partners. This partnering synopsis does not represent a guarantee of selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA), conceptual designs, technical data, proposal inputs, and schedule and cost estimates consistent with the NASA AO guidelines as described in the yet to be released AO.  Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel:  This criterion evaluates the offeror’s relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel (with resumes) available to support the development. Provide substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments. Capability includes quality and management process certifications and systems. (2) Cost and schedule control:	This criterion evaluates the offeror’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The offeror should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.   (3) Facilities:  This criterion evaluates the offeror’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The offeror should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members. This partnering synopsis solicits partners in all areas of the	mission life-cycle from definition, through design, development, integration and test, launch, operations, science data analysis and distribution.  Of particular interest are partners capable of delivering the following mission elements identified in 1 through 7 below. (1)	Science Instrumentation - LaRC is seeking potential partners for space borne science instrumentation in support of proposals which may include (a) ultra-violet/visible (310 - 900 nm) imaging spectrometers with sub-nanometer spectral resolution  (b) imaging IR (2-5 microns) instruments with effective spectral resolution of tenths of a wavenumber (c) far-infrared spectrometers capable of measuring wavelengths between 10 and 100 microns, (d) 10- 150 GHz H&V polarized microwave radiometers, and (e) 1.57 micron fiber based laser system for the  measurement of atmospheric column carbon dioxide with a measurement  precision of 1ppm or better. (f) elastic backscatter multi-wavelength lidar for measurements between 350 nm and 1100 nm. It is anticipated that the selected science instrumentation partner(s) would provide conceptual instrument designs, trade studies, operational concepts, calibration and characterization definition and planning, payload constraints/interface analysis, technical risk analysis, and would participate in cost analysis as part of the initial mission concept proposals.  For mission concepts selected through the ESSP solicitation process to proceed to Step 2, the partner(s) selected through this partnering synopsis would participate in the Step 2 mission proposal development and evaluation activities related to the mission selection reviews.  For missions subsequently selected for implementation through the ESSP solicitation process, partners selected through this partnering synopsis would provide flight qualified instruments and supporting calibration, integration and testing.  The selected payload development partner(s) would also participate in the planning and implementation of payload integration to the spacecraft and subsequent testing. (2) Mission Management.  LaRC is seeking potential partners for the space mission management function to work closely and collaboratively with the Principal Investigators and their teams throughout the life of the project (if selected) in order to achieve the complex objectives of the proposed missions. This includes development and analysis of mission concepts and strategies, establishment of high-level requirements and success criteria, and preparation of detailed plans, budgets, and schedules that are essential to the success of the project; prepare and conduct reviews of plans and performance at key milestones and obtain authorization to continue the effort and progress to the next phase; execute	approved plans for the development and operation of products and services, and establish required control systems to ensure performance to plan; and seek ongoing independent evaluation of the performance of the project, and incorporate the evaluation findings to ensure adequacy of planning and execution according to plan.    (3)  Spacecraft and Launch Options.  Potential partners are being sought to provide cost effective access to orbit. Offerors should describe co-manifest launch options or secondary payload opportunities to low-Earth and/or geostationary orbits for consideration in mission planning. (4) Mission Operations partner(s).  Potential partners are being sought to provide cost effective agile hardware and software solutions for data capture and distribution, and for spacecraft and payload operation..	Offerors should describe the scope of their recent capability and experience in mission operations solutions, including initial on-orbit checkout, and highly autonomous, self-diagnosing spacecraft operation systems.  Ground data capture, including backup stations, level 0 processing, archiving and data distribution experience for high data volume applications should be described.  (5) Payload Operations Partner (s).  Payload operations support a variety of operational modes, from safe hold, to calibration, other diagnostic modes, to normal (baseline) data taking modes.  Some payloads may require special events operational support (higher data rates, limited fields of view, enhanced payload pointing, cooling or other operational support) on command throughout the mission life.  Therefore, potential partners are sought to provide payload operation solutions that represent enhanced capability for “smart” payloads and distributed planning and implementation (6) Science data processing facilities.  The Science Mission Directorate acquires, processes and delivers very large (gigabyte to terabyte) volumes of remote sensing and related data to public and government entities that apply this information to understand and solve problems in Earth Science.  Current sensors can collect more data than is possible to transmit to the ground for analysis.  Consequently, offerors should describe capability and experience in cost effective solutions for science data processing and subsequent delivery to mission data archives.  Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 1) Software technologies that support the storage, handling, analysis, and interpretation of data. Examples include innovations in the enhancement, classification, or feature extraction processes;  2) efficient and effective techniques for processing large volumes of data (commonly available on the Internet) into useful information;  and 3) automation of routine, labor intensive tasks that either increase reliability or throughput of current processes.  The Principal Investigator and select Co-Investigator(s) will be responsible for generating the mission’s Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs).  These documents describe the physical and mathematical description of the algorithms to be used in the generation of data products. The ATBD typically includes a description of variance and uncertainty estimates and considerations of calibration and validation, exception control, and diagnostics.  Science data processing will be conducted under the direction of the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators and will fully implement the science algorithms described in mission ATBDs.	 (7) Education and Public Outreach, (E&PO).   LaRC is seeking partners to support E&PO activities that extend the knowledge learned through the ESSP-4 mission and engage the general public through various forms of media, as well as formal and informal education.  More specifically, LaRC is seeking E&PO partners that have experience in educating the public on NASA science missions, are willing to cost share, and have a clear approach to marketing the program activities and achievements to a regional and national audience. Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages for each technical area of interest (i.e. offerors responding to one or more of the 7 mission elements may submit up to 5 pages per each element).  Responses shall address each of the aforementioned evaluation criteria.  Resumes of key personnel and a cover page that clearly identifies the mission element area addressed by the response do not count against the total allocated page count.	All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via e-mail by 5:00 local time, September 22, 2005 to: Gaudy M. Bezos-OConnor, at Gaudy.M.Bezos-Oconnor@nasa.gov.  Technical Questions should be directed to Gaudy M. Bezos-Oconnor at the email address above, or 757-864-5083.  Procurement questions should be directed to Teresa Hass, via email at Teresa.M.Hass@nasa.gov or (757) 864-8496 or in Teresa’s absence to:  Mary Jane Yeager via email at, Mary.J.Yeager@nasa.gov or (757) 864-2473.

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     The U.S. Army Tank-automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of light tactical ambulances which will supply the Afghan National Army (ANA).  Durability for rough, mountainous terrain and climate of t he country of Afghanistan are crucial factors that will be considered as part of the selection process.  An urgent delivery schedule of starting shipment of 37 Ambulances by December 2005 to country is a firm requirement, with a potential for an estimate o f 500 additional ambulances.  A firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type-contract is intended to be issued.  Shipping terms will be Free-on-Board: Origin.  The Government is estimating the target award unit price to be approxima tely $30,000.  Operators manuals will need to be provided in English as well as translated into the language of Dari (Afghan Persian). The purpose of the survey is to assist in determining what commercial vehicles are available immediately which meet our needs, and possibly what Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) are currently available or could be available in the October 2005 timeframe.  Fo r planning purposes, a contract is targeted for award in November 2005. [As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a commercial item is (1) Any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, an d--(1) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or, (2) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public; (2) Any item that evolved from an item described in paragraph (1) of this definition through advances in technology  or performance and that is not yet available in the commercial marketplace, but will be available in the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the delivery requirements under a Government solicitation; (3) Any item that would satisfy a criterion expre ssed in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this definition, but for (i) Modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace; or (ii) Minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Go vernment requirements. Minor modifications mean modifications that do not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process. Factors to be considered in determ ining whether a modification is minor include the value and size of the modification and the comparative value and size of the final product. Dollar values and percentages may be used as guideposts, but are not conclusive evidence that a modification is mi nor. FAR defines a non-developmental item as follows:   a.   any previously developed item used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the U.S. has a mutual defense cooperation agreement.   b.   Any item described in paragraph a., above, that requires only minor modification to meet the requirements of the procuring agency.   c.   Any item currently being produced that does not meet the requirement of paragraphs a or b, above, so lely because the item is not yet in use.]   Your responses will assist in finalizing plans for this effort and a llow better definition of requirements, thereby providing a more clearly written solicitation to industry.   The government will not reimburse contractors for any costs incurred as a result of their participation in this survey.   ** Submit survey documentation by email no later than August 26, 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time, to: rybicksc@tacom.army.mil Attaching supporting electronic literature by email is preferred.

The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (HUBZone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, woman-owned, or large business) relative to North Amer ican Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (size standard of 1,000 employees). Small businesses may team together and be eligible for award. This sources sought is to conduct market research and receive capability papers from interested businesses/teams. RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:  Capability papers should include the following information: size of company (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, SB, SDVOSB, Veteran, all others), number  of employees, relevant past performance on same/similar work and your company/team capability to do this type of work.  Documentation and technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company/team pos sesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Interested firms should submit via e-mail and attach the capability statement (Microsoft Word format) within 15 days after the date of this announcement to eliz abeth.moulder@smdc.army.mil (title email:  JIEDDTF and AWG Support). Capability papers should not exceed ten (10) 8 1/2 x 11 pages, font size not smaller than Times New Roman 10.  No pictures, charts or graphs shall be included.   Any questions can be directed to Ms. Moulder. If a solicitation is issued it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  The submission of  this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items, nor do the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) intend to award on the basis of this request for information or otherw ise pay for the information solicited.   Capability papers should address that the contractor or contractor team has the demonstrated ability to perform the entire task.   The current effort to be performed under this contract is in direct support of operational forces who are experiencing frequent attacks by hostile forces using all forms of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  Recently the Deputy Secretary of Defense order ed the JIEDD-TF, directed by a Flag Officer, to focus all available DOD resources to counter this threat. Further, the emerging Asymmetric Warfare Group is being organized to accept the hand off of a portion of the JIEDD-TF mission. In addition to supporti ng the formation of the AWG, the JIEDD-TF must continue all assigned missions and tasks without interruption in order to support the needs of deployed forces in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Among ongoing tasks are the operational support of fiel d teams in the CENTCOM Theater of Operations to thoroughly investigate IED attacks, embed and train with deployed forces and provide information to the Director of the JIEDD-TF on behalf of the Army and CENTCOM. In particular, the Director, JIEDD-TF and Co mmander, AWG will require a high level of expertise in the areas of counter insurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (CT). Specifically, the offeror must have extensive experience in advisement and support concerning Joint Special Operations, to include operational and developmental experience in the use of explosives and their initiation, and the tactics and techniques associated with the use of explosives particularly as it relates to IED devices and all forms of asy mmetric warfare. Asymmetric warfare (AW) is operations conducted by terrorists, guerillas, militias and paramilitaries to limit US military effectiveness while achieving political objectives. Moreover, experience must include individuals with extensive bac kgrounds and established reputations in the development, organization, preparation and leadership of teams formed to respond in direct support of the vital interests of the Nation. Contracted effort requires that all contractors possess a minimum Security Clearance Classification of Secret, with some requirements for both Top Secret and Top Secret- Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).  Specific to the JIEDD TF, effort will consist of the following:  Advisement Team with established expertise in terrorist, guerilla and insurgent operations, experience with Joint Special Operations Forces and its relation to the development, formation, pre paration and staffing of special teams in direct support of National level objectives. This team will have experience synchronizing the transition of major projects and programs from short life-cycle management to long-term strategic efforts. This team wil l have demonstrated experience in recruitment, assessment, selection, and training procedure development. Strategic Communications/Public affairs experience in information dissemination to the Soldier, the public, industry and other Government organization s is also required.  Training Advisory Team will consist of certified explosive experts trained and qualified, at a minimum, to U.S. Army standards to advise and train units at major unit installations and Combat Training Centers throughout CONUS and other  countries or locations at the direction of the JIEDD-TF or AWG preparing them for combat operations and eventual deployment to any AOR. Team will also include research analysts, and a Program Coordinator. Field Investigative Teams will consist of multiple  teams consisting of broadly gauged experts to perform the training of IED mitigation measures and counter IED tactics, techniques and procedures to forces committed and forces preparing for entry into regions of hostility. The investigative teams could be  directed to investigate IED incidents and technologies anywhere in the world. Advisement, Training Advisory and Field Investigative Teams will also possess the proven skills, abilities and cognitive traits for operating in highly stressful environments of  Counter-Insurgency and Counter-Terrorism threats. These teams will show demonstrated abilities for adaptation to meet mission requirements addressing undefined and evolving Asymmetric threats. Specific to the AWG, effort will include in-depth and integrated analytic subject matter expertise and programmatic support to the following functional areas and missions. AWG Headquarters support will consist of liaison teams, which maintain the worldwide  Joint Common Operational Picture, provide supply, maintenance and chemical/biological protection support and integration of materiel solutions.  Operations Squadron support will consist of personnel available to deploy worldwide to observe, collect and di sseminate emerging AW TTPs, provide AW training and assist in identifying and integrating AW countermeasure technologies.  Support to the Training Advisory and Assessment Squadron will consist of analysis of intelligence, operational TTPs, training and mat eriel solution inter-relationships and the ability to articulate them in a strategy to combat asymmetric threats.  Support to the Concepts Integration Squadron will consist of coordination of AW materiel requirements with Army Materiel Command (AMC) and th e Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) as well as liaison with research & de velopment and acquisition communities.   This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. The proposed acquisition may involve a potential conflict of interest as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 9.5.

<SUBJECT>A -- CHAMBER SYSTEM FOR MEASUREMENT OF RADON EFFLUX
<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Stanford University for a chamber system for measurement of radon efflux from the soil and a soil gas diffusion model.  The proposed chamber system is an open-top chamber that should minimize pressure effects, and the walls shall be of clear plastic to minimize the effect of the chamber on the microclimate at the soil surface. It shall be attached at the bottom to with a metal ring approximately 1 meter in diameter that is imbedded in the soil.  The chamber shall be ventilated by natural convection.  The chamber system shall use a second gas introduced at the soil surface at a known flux to quantify the ventilation of the chamber.  Since radon and the tracer gas are transported similarly by the ventilation of the chamber, then the covariation of the concentration of the tracer with that of radon can be used to scale the radon flux to the tracer flux.  The purpose of developing a chamber system for measuring radon efflux from the soil is to calibrate and test a soil efflux model.  The resulting efflux model can be incorporated into global and mesoscale atmospheric transport models to simulate radon flux into the atmosphere from the land surface. Measurements of radon and CO2 concentration in the free atmosphere made from tall towers and aircraft will be used together with these radon flux simulations to quantify net CO2 flux from the land surface, and to trace atmospheric transport.  This measurement strategy will be a key component of the North American Carbon Program.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice shall be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and shall address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred).  Anticipated award date is September 9, 2005.

<SUBJECT>Q -- North East Medical MATO
<DESC>The U.S. Navy’s Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to establish, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, three bridge Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts with the three current MATO contractors who were awarded MATO contracts in fiscal year 2000.  These MATO contractors currently provide Healthcare Worker services for the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD and its associated sites:  Naval Health Clinic, Patuxent River, MD; Naval Health Clinic, Quantico, VA; and  Naval Health Clinic, Annapolis, MD.   

The current MATO contracts that require bridge services are as follows:  N62645-01-D-5005 (Cherokee Medical Services, LLC. (Cherokee Medical)), N62645-01-D-5006 (Professional Healthcare, Inc. (Professional Healthcare)) and N62645-01-D-5007 and (Arora Group, Inc.).  The current contracts expire on 30 September 2005.  The proposed bridge contracts’ Period of Performance will be from 1 Oct 05 to 31 Jan 06.

The four-month Bridge Contracts will continue to provide the minimum services that are currently being provided for the agencies identified above.  In addition to the minimum quantities stated above, maximum quantities will be added to the bridge contracts that will allow for the potential need of increased services.  These maximum quantities will be mirrored on the three bridge awards to provide for competition between the three contractors for these services.

The bridge contracts shall be placed in anticipation of the award of Medical Multiple Agency Task Order (MATO) contracts resulting from competitive Solicitation, N62645-05-R-0009, for the Northeast Medical MATO contracts, anticipated to be awarded in late November 2005.  The anticipated performance start date for the competitive MATO contracting effort is 1 January 2006.  The National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD and its associated sites:  Naval Health Clinic, Patuxent River, MD, Naval Health Clinic, Quantico, VA, and  Naval Health Clinic, Annapolis, MD. are charged with the mission of providing medical health care for upwards of 500,000 active duty military personnel and their dependents, retired military personnel and their dependents, and other authorized personnel.  This mission has a direct effect on the war fighting capability of the United States Navy.  In order to meet this mission requirement, the bridge contracts, with the performance period of 1 Oct 05 through 31 January 2006, must be in place NLT 15 Sept 2005 so as to avoid a lapse in services.  A lapse in service would have an immediate and detrimental effect on the ability of the Navy to man deployed vessels and to fulfill the Navy’s DOD Operations Plans obligations to provide personnel in forward areas for war fighting, peacekeeping and/or humanitarian efforts.

<SUBJECT>D -- Integrated Partner Management
<DESC>Request for Information - Integrated Partner Management.

This Request for Information(RFI) issued by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), Integrated Partner Management Program Office, is intended to solicit information from industry regarding technical solution and implementation alternatives for the Integrated Partner Management  (IPM) initiative.   This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request of Proposal or as an obligation on the part of FSA to acquire any products and/or services.  FSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI nor pay for the information provided.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of submission of responses to the RFI and FSA's use of such information.

The IPM Program Office is responsible for managing trading partner entities (i.e. schools, school services, lender services, guaranty agencies, private collection agencies, state agencies, federal agencies, accrediting agencies, and auditors) as they administer Title IV Financial Aid for Students.  IPM primarily supports the Enterprise Business Function Groups in the areas of Partner Participation & Enrollment and Oversight.  IPM management functions include enrollment, eligibility and oversight processes.  FSA is currently using four unique and non-integrated systems (Application for Approval to Participate in Federal Financial Aid Program (eAPP), eZ-Audit, Electronic Records Management (ERM), Postsecondary Education Participants System (PEPS)) to manage trading partner entities.  This has lead to management challenges in the areas of duplicate & conflicting data, excessive file transfers between systems, a high-level of system administration, and a lack of a centralized view of its trading partner(s).

The goal of the IPM initiative is to combine these unique systems outlined above into a single integrated IPM Business Solution / System.  This will ensure that FSA's customers and employees have access to institutional eligibility and oversight data that is the same and current.  The new IPM Business / System solution will cut across partner relationship, eligibility management, and oversight functions and will provide FSA with an end-to-end view of its partner eligibility and oversight business. The new business / system solution will also address the management challenges that FSA is currently facing with the legacy systems. 

It is highly recommended that interested parties review the Integrated Partner Management information package located at www.fsaextranet.ed.gov before preparing their submissions (Information package will be available by close of business on August 29, 2005).  RFI submissions shall not exceed 20 pages (text, graphic, tables, etc.) and shall address each of the following elements separately: 

1.  Present a high-level technical and management approach, including Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and non-COTS product(s), for the new IPM system.  Describe how these product(s) would be customized to meet FSA’s business needs. 

2.  If COTS product(s) are not recommended, explain why. 

3.  Provide examples of projects similar in nature that your company has delivered.  Include how legacy system data was transitioned / converted to the new system. Also, provide the name of the customer (company / organization), customer point of contact, point of contact's phone number, and email address.  FSA may contact these customers to discuss lesson learned. 

4.  What commercial and/or government Partner Relationship Management trends could be relevant and successfully applied to IPM?

5.  What commercial and/or government Risk Management trends could be relevant and successfully applied to IPM?

6.  What commercial and/or government Case Management trends could be relevant and successfully applied to  IPM?

7.  Provide an estimated cost associated with all COTS license(s).

8.  Provide FTE estimates, resource experience levels, and costs (including hardware) to design, develop, and implement the new IPM system.

9.  Recommend the type of information your company would like to see in the Request for Proposal's Statement Of Objectives and Requirements Document that would allow your organization to effectively scope and price the effort.

10.  What documentation does your organization require to effectively transition the operation of the legacy system from its current operator to your organization? Also, describe the system data your organization will need to effectively operate and maintain the legacy system pending the implementation of the new IPM system. 

11.  Provide your business size and any additional company information that you have determined is relevant.  

The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.  However, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is propriety will be properly safeguarded for Government use only.  Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.  Questions, concerns, and responses should be emailed to Mr. Tirene Crowell at Tirene.Crowell@ed.gov.  Responses shall be submitted by 3PM Eastern Standard Time, September 12, 2005.  Responses shall be submitted in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and include the name and telephone of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.    Responses received after the due date may not be reviewed.

The barrier bag materials sought must have improved properties and performance over the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) barrier bag material which is constructed of a flexible, multi-layer nylon/foil film.   The JSLIST nylon/foil film has an opaque finish, is tan or green depending on whether the garment is in a woodland or desert camouflage pattern. The barrier bag materials sought will at least have the following physical properties: maximum  water vapor transmission rate of  0.30 g/cm2/24 hrs when tested in acco rdance with ASTM F1249;  minimum tensile strength of 24 lbs (machine direction) and 20 lbs (cross machine direction) when tested in accordance with ASTM D883; minimum tear strength of 140 grams (machine direction) and 100 grams (cross machine direction) wh en tested in accordance with ASTM D1922; minimum seam strength of 10 lbs/in when tested in accordance with ASTM F88; and ultraviolet resistance which is indicated by no alligatoring or detrimental degradation of the sample after 350 hours exposure when tes ted in accordance with ASTM D3218.  The barrier materials will be capable of being constructed into a bag which: has inside dimensions of approximately 12 x 20 inches; can be heat sealed to a minimum strength of 10 pounds per linear inch when tested in acc ordance with ASTM F88; is suitable for printing identification and manufacturing markings, and for the placement of a small notch (1/8 inch deep) at its edge. The bag packaged with the JSLIST coat or trouser will be capable of being vacuumed sealed at 21-2 4 inches Hg.  This Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment from the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise  pay for information/materials.  Product samples will not be returned.  Interested sources must, within thirty (30) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their product(s). Information may be in the form of product lit erature, technical specifications, material specifications, test data, and a sample.  Information should include product cost, relevant company background/experience, and facilities.  Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business .

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Before we can begin the contracting process with your company, I need the following Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) completed-- http://orca.bpn.gov/.  FOR MPIN REGISTRATION: http://www.ccr.gov/mpin.asp.   Use of online representations & certifications application (ORCA) became mandatory 1 January 2005.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online. Representations and certifications are to be completed at least annually by vendors on-line through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.  Initially, ORCA will retain the most significant contractor representations and certifications that would apply to any acquisition in the form of 26 questions.  Solicitation-specific representations and certifications may still be used outside of ORCA.  Further information on this initiative may be obtained from the  ORCA help menu, http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.  This help menu includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and the ORCA Handbook.
