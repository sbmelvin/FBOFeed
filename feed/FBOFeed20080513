<DESC>The computer solution for the Tactical Air Control Party Modernization (TACP-M) Program is a rugged, small, light weight, and low power portable computers that use PC Internal Data Modems (PCIDM) to interface with Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF), High Frequency (HF) and SATCOM radios .  Currently, the interface between the computers and the Internal Data Modem is the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slots.  Many computers in this class lack PCMCIA support.  In addition, the PCMCIA slots will become obsolete in the future as the computer industry is moving to other interface methods.  The contractor will modify the existing PCIDM product to work with computers lacking PCMCIA support and future migration through the use of Universal Serial Bus.

<p>The contractor shall provide design/layout, delivery, and installation of all equipment needed to support the Battle Staff room, Control Center and Alarm Monitor rooms, Conference Room, Classroom and Building Media and Information Systems.</p>
<p><br />The Control Center sources sought will have the following specifications (these specifications are not meant to be definitive, but represent in summary form, the general areas to be supported):</p>
<p>1. General: The unique nature of security force operations require specially designed and installed equipment to make best use of the man hours used. During contingencies three or more major operations may be executed simultaneously, each requiring different procedures and each critical to the base's ability to continue its mission. The below specialty areas require additional furniture and systems acquisitions to enable the SFS to provide optimum support to the base mission. Selection will be based on the submission that best supports Security Force operations.</p>
<p>1.1. Battle Staff (BDOC): Primarily provides oversight for security operations during contingencies. The Commander and staff need access to up to the minute information about contingency situations, current manning, and responding forces so that they can evaluate and direct forces effectively to limit damage to the base mission. A Battle Staff Concept of Operations document is provided in Attachment #1 and submissions should be designed to support the operations outlined in this document. Items listed below are considered operational must haves.<br />1.2. Control Center: The security control center is the nerve center of security force operations, receiving input from the field, synthesizing it for use by the Battle Staff, and enacting orders of the Battle Staff. A Control Center Concept of Operations document is provided in Attachment #2 and submissions should be designed to support the operations outlined in this document. Items listed below are considered operational must haves.<br />1.3. Conference Room: A comprehensive presentation system is desired; video conferencing capability is also desired.<br />1.4. Training Classroom: A comprehensive presentation system that includes a video recording package is needed.<br />1.5. Media and Information System: The building is designed with a number of video screens throughout. A media package that connects these to the base IPTV system and allows us to post crucial information that will page across the screen, keeping security forces informed without the use of multiple bulletin boards placed around the building is needed.</p>
<p>Services Summary:</p>
<p>Room 133: Battle Staff (BDOC)<br />Count Item<br />1 Furniture and systems that support the concept of operations in Attachment 1.<br />1 Video Conference Capabilities.<br />1 At least three workstations within the battle staff room with network access.<br />1 Wireless capability to arrange Control Center video wall feed display from this room.</p>
<p>Room 134 &amp; 135: Control Center/Alarm Monitor<br />Count Item<br />1 Control Center and Alarm monitor system that supports the concept of operations in Attachment 1.<br />1 Wireless capability to arrange video wall feed display from this room.<br />1 Video wall with minimum of 8 screens.<br />1 Workstation for one that will accommodate 2-3 operators during contingencies.<br />1 Customer Service station located at the SFCC main service window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachment #1<br />Battle Staff<br />Concept of Operations</p>
<p><br />Battle Staff Room Details:</p>
<p>The Battle Staff is manned by a senior SF member(s) during a contingency or emergency situation. The person(s) working in this room need the ability to monitor all actions being taken by the Security Forces Control Center Operator, yet also be able to conduct their own business uninterrupted. Therefore the best concept is for the battle staff room to overlook the SFCC, separated by windows. Ideally, there would be a doorway between the two rooms and a sliding window at a reasonable location where the SFCC Operator and Battle Staff members could exchange paperwork and information.</p>
<p>Equipment needed is as follows:<br />- STE (1 minimum) for ability to contact outside agencies on a secure line<br />- 1 Desktop computer w/large screen dedicated to GEOBASE or other emergency response tools. Wall mount flat screens are most desirable.<br />- 1 Desktop computer w/large screen dedicated to completing reports, papers, etc., as required based on the situation, wall mount flat screens are most desirable.<br />- 1 Printer.<br />- 1 copy machine (this could be shared with SFCC)<br />- 1 fax machine - better if this one is dedicated to Battle Staff.<br />- Workstations for 3-4 personnel, including desk space, chairs.<br />- Reference library with access to all required checklists, 0Plans, AFIs, etc. <br />- Large base grid map and mapping tools (disks, dry erase markers, etc.) <br />- Large dry erase white board w/supplies<br />- 1 or 2 lockers with emergency response kits/supplies inside them. (Currently we just have this stuff stuck in a corner).<br />- Lighting controls - recessed lighting with dimmers works best<br />- Phone systems with 2-4 lines including direct line to EOC, Command Post, etc. Small area for coffee pot, supplies, microwave.<br />- Ability for Video Tele Conference setup. All required hardware and software will be coordinated with pertinent on base agencies that support this service (COMM).<br />- MacDill Base station- ability to switch frequencies talk to any org on base via base station/handheld radio.<br />- Wall mount flat screen w/cable of IPV hookup for local/national news stations for updated news during catastrophe, national emergency, hurricane evacuation, etc.</p>

<SUBJECT>Relationships Between Laboratory-Measured and Field-Derived Properties of Pavement Layers
<SOLNBR>DTFH61-08-R-00032
<CONTACT>angela fortson, Email angela.fortson@dot.gov
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to sponsor systematic research to develop a fundamental understanding of the factors underlying observed differences between laboratory-measured and field-derived properties of pavement layers.  Ultimately, this work is to support development of improved methods and/or relationships that will allow laboratory and field-based methods of material characterization to be used interchangeably for design and performing analyses.  

Research is needed to clearly explain the difference between the backcalculated layer moduli and the laboratory measured properties, such as dynamic and resilient modulus of asphalt, elastic modulus of Portland cement concrete (PCC) and cement-stabilized material, and the resilient modulus of unbound materials.

This project will be considered successful if it yields either relationships enabling the interchangeable use of laboratory-resilient modulus test data and backcalulated values, or a clear explanation of why it was not possible to derive such relationships. 

This effort will likely require expertise in the areas of pavement materials characterization and modeling, laboratory pavement materials testing and mechanism, numerical modeling of pavement systems, mechanistic and empirical pavement design, use of FWD data to evaluate in-service pavements, backcalculation of pavement moduli using FWD data, strength and deformation modeling of the pavement layers. 

This requirement will be conducted under full and open competitive procedures.  For the purposes of subcontracting and to identify potential small business, the NAICS code for this solicitation is 541712, with a Small Business size standard of 500 employees.
A solicitation will be available on FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov.  The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps posting system listed above.  Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by e-mail. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Contract Specialist, Fax 301-827-7151, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA1041476

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking a Total Small Business Set-Aside for vendors to write an analytical report on the Effect of Occlusion (Overlays) on the Percutaneous Absorption of Drugs

Description of Work/Statement of Work. 

i) Background
Occlusion and subsequent hydration of the stratum corneum, which is the uppermost layer of the skin consisting of dead cells, increases the absorption through the skin (percutaneous absorption) for many drugs.   This could result, for example, from the use of water-impermeable tape over a transdermal patch.  Generally, hydration of the skin causes a decrease in the stratum corneum resistance and an increase in the delivery rate of drugs that have the stratum corneum as the rate limiting step to drug diffusion.  It is possible that a drug that is not rate-limited by the stratum corneum, but by the viable epidermis, may not be as significantly affected by skin hydration as other drugs.  It might also be possible that with more water in the stratum corneum that a very hydrophobic drug might even have a decreased delivery rate. 

ii) Vendor Objectives
The objective of this research is to examine percutaneous absorption of model compounds with different hydrophobicities, occluded and non-occluded, using the human skin in vitro diffusion model and pre-clinical studies.  Cadaver skin or abdominal reduction surgical waste skin and a diffusion cell system shall be used for permeation studies.  Different drugs shall be applied, and movement across the skin shall be determined by measuring drug concentration on either side of skin layer in the diffusion cell.  The diffusion experiment is initiated by applying an appropriate amount of formulation to the skin, unoccluded or occluded (with or without an impermeable cover).  Bioclusive cover can be used to mimic the occlusion condition in later stage experiments.  The diffusion samples shall be analyzed according to modified extraction and chromatography methods found in the scientific literature.  Based on the results, permeability studies shall be conducted in the appropriate animal model (hairless guinea pig).  Candidate drugs shall be applied with and without occlusion to the skin of hairless guinea pigs.  Blood samples shall be collected over time, and analyzed for drug concentrations using validated analytical methods. Using plasma concentrations vs. time profiles, the pharmacokinetics of each drug shall be determined following transdermal application.  Finally, in vitro-in vivo correlations shall be developed, using results from the diffusion studies in vitro, and the in vivo study in animals.

Specific Aim 1: Vendor shall test the hypothesis that the significant effect of occlusion on triamcinolone acetonide (or a similar drug) percutaneous absorption can be measured in human skin in vitro; 

Specific Aim 2: Vendor shall test the hypothesis that occlusion will also have a significant effect on a more hydrophilic molecule (triamcinolone) and not have an effect on two very hydrophobic molecules (fentanyl and oxybutynin) in human skin in vitro.  

Specific Aim 3: Vendor shall develop predictive models using in vitro and in vivo data from animal studies.

Reporting Requirements and Deliverable Items. 

A written progress report shall be provided to the FDA six months after award in both paper and electronic formats.  Receipts for expenditures should be submitted and will be reimbursed on a monthly basis.  In addition to labor, supplies and overhead costs, expenditures include travel economy class to one conference, and reimbursement for hotels, meals, and transportation.  

Thirty days before the completion of the project, a report analyzing the results of the study shall be provided to the FDA.   In addition, all of the raw data from the experiments, in both paper and electronic format, shall be provided to the FDA.  Data may be shared with the institution where the research is conducted.

Duration of Project. 
The FDA anticipates a one year period of performance.

Evaluation Criteria for Competitive Proposals.

50% Qualification of the PI as assessed by education, publications, and previous research projects relevant to the project.

25% Quality of the facilities required including laboratory space and analytical instrumentation.

25% Quality of the proposal as assessed by its ability to meet the requirements in the statement of work

Site Visit Schedule.

FDA scientists will visit the vendors site two times during the period of performance.

The performance period shall be one year from the time of award.  The NACIS code for this work is 541690. Vendors response to this RFQ must be limited to no more than 10 pages.

This is a REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 5:00 pm (1600) EST on May 20, 2008.

<SUBJECT>Assessing Risks of Changing Sterile Drug Manufacturing Sites
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-00641a
<RESPDATE>052808
<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Fax 301-827-7151, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA-SOL-08-00641a

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Full and Open Competition for vendors to write an analytical report on Sterile Drug Manufacturing sites. 

The purpose is to demonstrate risks due to changing the manufacturing site can be managed strictly within the manufacturer's change control process so that a supplement to an application is not required.

Changing sterile drug product manufacturing sites poses risks to product safety and quality. Currently, changing manufacturing locations is considered a "major" change, requiring a company to submit a supplement to an application. The Office of Pharmaceutical Science (OPS) has embraced Quality by Design (QbD) to ensure that risks associated with manufacturing changes are managed within the manufacturer's internal change control process. 

OPS reviewers make decisions on product safety and quality based on how a manufacturer describes site specific changes to their sterile manufacturing process.  OPS reviewers require detailed information regarding the proposed manufacturing facility, the manufacturing process, the methods by which the processes will be validated, and the expected outcome of validation studies. 

Specifically, the vendor shall demonstrate how changing the manufacturing site for sterile drug products can be managed strictly within manufacturer's internal change control process. The authorization to do this would be granted through approval of a risk management plan.  Risks include sterility assurance failures due to variations in the facility, manufacturing process, design space and/or process control strategies (e.g. validation, sampling, monitoring, and acceptance criteria), and the introduction of impurities to the drug product as a result of changes, raw materials, equipment, and/or container closure components.  The vendor shall describe a way to make manufacturing site changes using change control processes that are part of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP).  To accomplish this goal, the vendor shall interview industry experts and OPS review staff. The vendor shall then document the findings, using ICH Q9 Risk Management and OMB/OSTP's "Updated Principles for Risk Analysis."  Following development of a work plan, the tasks will be divided into a data gathering process and summary, followed by the risk management draft document for each product class (synthetic and biotech).  The selected vendor will have a record of brining together a wide range of groups and people to generate consensus through workshops and/or forums.  The performance period will be one year from the time of award.  The NACIS code for this work is 541618. Vendors response to this RFQ must be limited to no more than 10 pages.

This is a REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 5:00 pm (1600) EST on May 19, 2008.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov to be considered.  FDA intends to make an award soon after the response date of this notice and all bids must be submitted via email and be received by 10:00 AM (1000) EST on 28 May 2008 to the attention of David Kordel, david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for two novel portable, hand held semiconductor laserbased prototype sensors for the detection, monitoring and quantification of &lt;5ppmv CO,&lt;1ppmv HCN, &lt;1ppmv HCl, and CO2 in the 300ppmv 3% range with ~1 second updaterates.The contract will have three deliverables:1)	A prototype gas detection system that demonstrates the QEPAS (Quartz EnhancedPhotoacoustic Spectroscopy) approach for the target gas species.2)	A prototype gas detection system that demonstrates the PHOTONS (PhotonicNetworked Sensors) platform for the target gas species.3)	A report documenting the key performance metrics including response time,detection limits, and chemical specificity. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Rice Univeristy. Based upon the uniquecapabilities of Rice University in the development of QEPAS (Quartz EnhancedPhotoacoustic Spectroscopy) and PHOTONS (Photonic Networked Sensors) and the successfuldemonstration of prototype systems in hostile environments, the impact of not contractingwith Rice University could jeopardize developing prototype hardware that demonstratesfunction in time to meet flight delivery schedule needs.  Failure to contract with Riceeliminates the chance to evaluate QEPAS, and increases the risk that a prototype failsinitially and requires redesign and redevelopment.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Based uponmarket research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12,Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies orservices.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the American Journal of Preventive Medicine (AJPM), 9500 Gilman Drive, DEPT 0811, La Jolla, CA 92093-0811 for publication services regarding a special supplement "The Science of Team Science: Assessing the Value of Transdisciplinary Research".</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be from June 1, 2008 - October 30, 2008.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requisition is to produce a publication for the scientific community on a topic of key interest to the Behavioral Research Program/DCCPS/NCI and the NIH. Specifically, the special supplement will discuss the outcomes from an NCI-led national scientific conference entitled - The Science of Team Science: Assessing the Value of Transdisciplinary Research. This national conference was held October 30-31, 2006 in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>The articles for the supplemental issue will be based on the presentations given at this meeting, as well as additional commentaries regarding topics that were determined to be important additions to the presentations. This special issue will be distributed to the general research community and will help disseminate important research gathered at the conference. The main goal of the publication will be to help the audience of health  researchers learn about critical scientific and management challenges related to transdisciplinary research including issues regarding leadership, training, and creating new methods and metrics to evaluate this type of research. This special issue is critical, given that this was the first conference sponsored by NIH on the topic of transdisciplinary research and methodology, and there is burgeoning interest at NIH and elsewhere on transdisciplinary team science .</p>
<p>The American Journal of Preventive Medicine (AJPM) specifically addresses educational initiatives aimed at improving the ability of health professionals to provide effective clinical prevention and public health services. The AJPM publishes original, peer-reviewed articles in the areas of prevention research, teaching, practice and policy. Papers on health services research pertinent to prevention and public health are also published.   AJPM is read by multiple disciplines, and is disseminated to researchers with less experience in transdisciplinary science who may find the information useful in pursing these types of collaborative activities.  The AJPM is the only known journal that specifically targets new researchers, as well as existing researchers and teachers . For the aforementioned reasons, the AJPM is uniquely qualified to perform this work.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on May 27, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80073-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), conducts research on marine mammals important to the mission of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and NOAA, with particular attention to issues related to marine mammals off the coasts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California.
The North Pacific right whale Eubalaena Japonica was severely depleted by whaling in the past two centuries.  The current size of the eastern population is estimated at fewer than 100 individuals and this stock is considered critically endangered; its current distribution is known only from records in a relatively limited area of the southeastern Bering Sea, and from a few occurrences in the Gulf of Alaska.  Historical catch and sighting data indicate that right whales were abundant and widely distributed in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska in summer and early autumn.

The NMML has a requirement for the performance of aerial surveys to determine distribution and abundance of cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin.  The aerial surveys shall take place in the North Aleutian Basin in the Bering Sea during the months of July and August 2008 and 2009, focusing on the regions currently designated as Right Whale critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act, and proposed oil and gas sale lease areas in the Southeastern Bering Sea.  The Government will provide the survey aircraft.  Reconnaissance flights and line transect surveys will be flown to determine, through observation, the distribution and abundance of North Pacific Right Whales and other cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin.  When encountered, Right Whales and other large cetaceans shall be photographed.  The aerial surveys will require an experienced scientific team comprised of a Project Coordinator/Principle Investigator, Field Project Leader and three Observers. The Principle Investigator must demonstrate knowledge of aerial survey methodology.  The Principle Investigator and Field Project Leader shall plan and coordinate the aerial surveys in consultation with NMML to determine the survey effort area.  Observers shall have experience photographing and identifying marine mammals from aircraft, and be familiar with computer software used to collect sightings, survey conditions, and position data.  The vendor shall compile the survey data, photographic images, and provide final field reports and raw data (including photographic images) to NMML within two months of the end of the survey for each survey period.  Deliverables will include electronic files containing all raw data including photographic images, a report summarizing all survey effort, sightings, and environmental conditions.  
 

This procurement is open to all interested parties.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.  For this procurement, the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract.  The period of performance is for one (1) base year with one (1) additional one-year option period.  Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about April 1, 2008 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued.  For a copy of the solicitation, please utilize the FedBizOpps feature [register to receive notification] as well as [register as an interested vendor] to receive e-mail notification upon release of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA201) is soliciting information from industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully design, develop, integrate, test and qualify a new Multi-Purpose Bomb Rack (MPBR).  The Government intends to procure on a competitive basis the System Design and Development (SDD) of a non-pyrotechnic Multi-Purpose Bomb Rack (MPBR) for carriage and release of weapons and stores employed on BRU-33, BRU-41, BRU-42 and BRU-55 bomb racks.  This rack must employ weapons and stores cleared to the current envelope of the F/A-18+/C/D and E/F series aircraft.  This rack is also intended for employment of future weapons such as Joint Air to Ground Missile and Small Diameter Bomb and for integration on the JSF and other objective platforms.  A complete list of threshold and objective stores and platforms is contained in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) as Attachment 1 to the draft RFP to be release under a separate announcement.  Accommodation of objective stores and platforms is not required for the supplier to submit a qualified proposal.  However, the Government will consider proposals that do accommodate objective stores and platforms to have additional merit above those which are threshold-compliant only.

The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to assess current industry experience and capabilities, and to support the possibility of a full and open competition to satisfy the objectives identified herein.  This Sources Sought is the first of several future announcements advertising this requirement.  NAVAIR plans to issue a separate Sources Sought announcement which will include the Governments Draft contract and performance specification.  The MPBR performance specification and Statement of Objectives are currently under development; however, early draft specifications and other related technical and programmatic documentation will also be made available for your review and comment at that time.  NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in the responses to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, performance specification and RFP.

A major objective of this SDD effort is to minimize flight-testing and re-certification of the threshold stores on the threshold aircraft by requiring the MPBR conform to the Outer Mold Line of the BRU-33 bomb rack, with the addition of store umbilicals and supporting hardware.  Offerors who have the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to successfully develop and provide an MPBR will be required to submit a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer analysis of the Offerors design concept.  Specific details for the CFD will be contained in the draft RFP.

A competitive performance-based specification solicitation for the MPBR effort is anticipated for release in the 4th quarter of FY08.  A Best Value source selection is planned with an anticipated award in FY09.  Interested parties should check this web site periodically for updated information.
 

It is anticipated that the draft RFP will be posted to the NAVAIR homepage on or about 15 May 2008.  The NAVAIR homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  To find the solicitation you must select Doing Business with Us and then Open Solicitations or call the help desk at (301) 342-4686 if you  are in need of further assistance.  Except as noted here, the Government will only release the draft solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet.  No telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted, no written requests will be accepted and no hard copies will be mailed.

Any amendments issued will be posted on the same NAVAIR web page.  After the draft solicitation release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all amendments.  Failure to obtain any posted amendments and to respond to each of them prior to the date and time set for receipt of offers may render your offer non-responsive.

<CONTACT>Vaughn Lasater 850-235-5362 , or Contracting Officer Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole-source contract to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT), 1900 Campus Commons Drive, Suite 300, Reston, VA 20191-5464, to perform a hydrodynamic analysis to assess the hydrodynamic performance effects of modifying the nose shape from the present configuration to a hemispherical shape and generate a new hydrodynamic model for use with the autopilot design.  Additionally contractor support is required to perform an autopilot analysis, using the new hydrodynamic model, for the various AQS-20 configurations (e.g., single pass shallow, single pass deep, volume, and identification mode) and tow cables (MH-53, MH-60, Remote Minehunting Vehicle) to assess the impact of the modified nose shape on the autopilot performance.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the localizer algorithm.  Accurate hydrodynamic analysis of the AN/AQS-20A model is critical to the operation of the AN/AQS-20A.  Use of another company to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an accurate hydrodynamic analysis could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  
All deliverables will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. The NAICS is 541330, Small Business Size Standard is $4M, the FSC is AD24. Contract Specialist: Vaughn Lasater Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, email  Vaughn.lasater@navy.mil .  NSWC Panama City intends to release the solicitation electronically only on or about 05/30/08.

<CONTACT>DAVID GAGLIARDI 215-697-9606 DAVID GAGLIARDI, CODE 260.1B; PHONE 215-697-9606; FAX 215-697-9569; E-MAIL ADDRESS: david.gagliardi1@navy.mil.
<DESC>The FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire, on a sole source basis, continued development and implementation of an Internet Web-based, Department of Navy Criminal Justice Information System (DONCJIS) on behalf of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) representing the interests of the U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Law Enforcement, Corrections, Judge Advocate General (JAG) judicial components, and the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS) Component Responsible Officials (CRO).  This is a requirement for a contractor to provide full life cycle software development services (requirements analysis, project management and planning, design, development, testing, documentation and training, implementation, and post-implementation support) for a new Criminal Incident and Case Management System.  The Department of the Navy Criminal Justice Information System (DONCJIS) is an evolutionary next step in the modernization of the Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center (CLEOC) and will serve as the Navys cradle-to-grave law enforcement information system by incorporating data on criminal investigations and their associated legal proceedings and correctional records.  The primary objective for DONCJIS is to provide a web-based interface for data entry of criminal incident and case data; incorporate business processes and workflow requirements from the law enforcement, investigative, judicial, and corrections user community; enhance the existing systems for US Navy and Marine Corps Law Enforcement, JAG, and Corrections users; provide full data processing and case tracking capabilities from incident to corrections; include in-depth reporting capabilities, data extracts, and statistical analysis of criminal data; and solve limited network bandwidth problems for users who connect to the system via dial-up connections.
These development and implementation services are currently being performed by InterImage, Inc. under FISC Contract N00140-05-D-0058 which was competitively awarded as a small business set-aside. This is a cost plus fixed fee type contract on which delivery orders are issued. 
Due to unanticipated growth of the DONCJIS user population and consequent revisions to the system requirements, the contract ceiling and estimated level of effort has been exhausted.  It is therefore necessary to modify the current contract in order to add sufficient ceiling and hours to complete development and implementation of the DONCJIS System thru final system approval.  It is estimated that approximately 93,813 additional hours of effort will be added to the contract in order to complete DONCJIS development. The period of performance of the contract is expected to extend thru 31 March 2009 including final system acceptance and initial operations.
It is further anticipated that a competitive solicitation will be issued in the near future for the operation and maintenance of the completed DONCJIS system as well as potential future development tasks associated with DONCJIS.  The new contract would take over after completion of the current contract.
The currently proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contracting action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposal Number R-CHI-00943 in support of the HUD headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Research, Evaluation and Monitoring Division. One indefinite-quantity contract (IQC) is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation for research and analysis of administrative data for a variety of housing and supportive services to measure the impact on homeless families. The purpose of this research effort will be to reach some definitive conclusions as to the minimum combinations of housing and services necessary to effectively produce housing stability and family well-being among variously challenged homeless families.  The inquiry will require conducting a panel study of homeless families with differing levels of challenge that will be exposed to various combinations of housing and supportive services.  Families will be tracked for as long as feasible, using survey research and administrative data to measure impact.  Outcomes will include housing stability, income, and employment, changes in substance use, adult and child well-being.  This IQC contract has a duration of 120 months from the date of award.  The funding source for the base project must be expended by the end of FY 2011, and extension of participant tracking beyond the time envisioned in the base project would require a separate source of support.  Under the base project, each offeror should be alerted to the possibility that participant tracking could be extended to four years from enrollment (2.5 years beyond the tracking schedule for the base project provided for in this RFP). This procurement is unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) and the size standard is $6.5 million, average for the last three years.  A Time and Materials type contract is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation. However, the Government reserves the right to award the most appropriate type of contract. If the contractor awarded this contract is a large business concern, a subcontracting plan is required to be submitted with their proposal.  The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has established a 45% small business goal for prime contractors.  The solicitation package will be available on or about 15 days form this notification and proposals will be due on or about 45 days from this announcement. Special Announcement: This notice will be posted on HUD's Internet Home Page since HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities at http//www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/Index.cfm.  Potential offerors who download copies of solicitations from HUD's Home Page Contracting Opportunities or FedBizOpps will not automatically receive any amendments to those solicitations. You are advised to check back frequently to see if HUD has issued any amendments to solicitation you have obtained. Hard copies of this solicitation may be obtained by writing to: Wayne Bernacki, Contract Specialist, HUD Chicago Contracting Operations Branch, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Room 2517, Chicago Illinois 60604-3507 or you may contact Wayne Bernacki at 312/886-2760, extension 2505. Please make reference to the solicitation number.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

It has a tilt bed suitable to load self propelled equipment such as the skid steer, tool cat, and forklift to the fish trap, fish dump, the basin, and Howard Hanson Dam. This trailer can be towed by any vehicle in the MMD motor pool which makes it more compact and maneuverable and doesn't tie up the dump truck. Without this trailer, the large dump truck with a trailer would need to be used which is over sized for the load to be carried. It is also far less economical and less convenient and will not fit into smaller areas where corners are tight and turning around is not possible.

The Regional Contracting Office, Southwest (RCO SW), Camp Pendleton, CA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the above named company with a one (1) month base period and  three (3), one (1) month option periods.  This bridge contract is necessary to ensure services are not interrupted after 6 June 2008 until the follow-on contract (which is currently in a source selection status) is awarded.

As Office Depot is currently providing supplies and services to the CMSC store, it already has an existing stock of supplies at the store and is familiar with CMSCs internal operating systems and procedures.  No other source would be prepared to begin services by 6 June 2008, as there is not enough time to initiate a turnover process and train a new source on internal operating procedures. The anticipated award date is 7 June 2008.  
This notice is not a request for competitive quotations. This notice is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals, or quotations.

<CONTACT>Sharon L. Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-1781, Fax 301-427-1740, Email sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking an ANSI-accredited Standard Development Organization (SDO) to coordinate and effect the development of standard value sets (i.e., code sets) needed to implement the common reporting formats for patient safety event (PSE) reporting. The project would also establish a mechanism for the maintenance of resultant value sets. The development of these value sets is critical to promoting the inter-operability of patient safety event data for clinical care and public health. Standardization of the value sets will allow more efficient aggregation and analysis of reported data and will provide a more efficient process for disseminating any future changes to the value sets.

It is AHRQs intent to award this project to Health Level Seven if no other interested SDOs respond to this sources sought notice.

Background Statement - Section 923(a) of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Act) mandates that the Secretary (of Health and Human Services) facilitate the creation of, and maintain, a network of patient safety databases (NPSD). Further, the Secretary has chosen, under authority conferred by Section 923(b), to determine common formats (CF) for the reporting to and among NPSD. AHRQ has led the coordination of development of these common formats through an Interagency Work Group. The members of this workgroup include CDC, CMS, FDA, HRSA, NIH, VA, IHS, and the DoD.   The common formats (version 0.1 Beta) will be released in July/August 2008.  As part of the development of common formats data sets for patient safety event reporting AHRQ intends to support the development of American National Standard (ANS) value sets.

The AHRQ-led common formats development process has identified various on going harmonization initiatives and discovered competing, and, thus, the absence of, standard PSE value for such basic variables as type of health care facility and location within a facility.  The immediate purpose of these value sets is for use in the PSE common formats.  A subsequent purpose is to encourage adoption worldwide for use in other health care applications, such as for regulatory and administrative purposes.

The maintenance and updating of these PSE value sets will be arranged by AHRQ once the initial value sets are developed. 

	Acquisition Plan Work - The work of this acquisition plan is to harmonize existing and develop new standard definition/value sets for health care facilities, health care workers, and locations within health care facilities. Task involved will include:
	Creating a catalogue of existing value sets related to PSE data
	Drafting a conceptual framework for defining/classifying health care facilities, health care workers and locations within health care facilities.
	Identifying/review existing and developing new proposed standard value sets for health care facilities, health care workers, and locations within health care facilities
	Revising proposed standard value sets for health care facilities, health care workers, and locations within health care facilities via an ANSI-accredited  consensus process.
	Publishing value sets for health care facilities, health care workers, and locations within health care facilities.	
	Maintenance of these value sets will then arranged by AHRQ once the initial set has been developed.

Contractor Experience and Capability Requirements
AHRQ is seeking:
1.	Standards Development Organization which:
&#61607;	develops standards for interoperability to improve care delivery, optimize workflow, reduce ambiguity and enhance knowledge transfer for all stakeholders, including the government
&#61607;	operates in the clinical and health administrative data domain
&#61607;	is ANSI-accredited
&#61607;	Specializes in the healthcare arena and in the development of standard value sets and related data exchange standards  for patient safety clinical data.
2.	Expert staff with demonstrated knowledge of complex databases, common data formats and their use in patient safety event reporting systems.
3.	Prior experience related to development of taxonomy and interoperable ANSI-accredited data standards related to patient safety and quality improvement initiatives.

AHRQ intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  However, interested organizations that believe they are capable of performing the above with the requisite qualifications and expertise should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirements.  Capability statements are due no later than May 28, 2008.  No solicitation is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at Sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov or paper copies (original and two copies) to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  Capability statements should be no more than 10 pages long and may include attachments such as resumes in addition to the 10 page limit.  Capability statements received after May 28, 2008 will not be reviewed.  Organizations should include their DUNS number and indicate the size of the company (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone, etc.).  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement or a sole source procurement.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought
---------------
A.	General Information:
The Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Heartland Regions, collectively referred to as Logistical Support Area (LSA) North, a military integrated delivery network comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of states of Maryland, Virginia, New York, Washington D.C., Delaware, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky  announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Ostomy Supplies to include, but not limited to pre-cut & cut to fit wafers one & two piece drainage pouches, adhesives, clamps and closures, belts, skin preparations, deodorants and lubricants

The Mid-Atlantic Region has been designated as the Lead Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) for this standardization action.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across the LSA North based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The 8 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) that will be participating in this standardization initiative are:  Northeast Region  79th Medical Wing, Andrews AFB, MD; Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Mid-Atlantic Region- 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; Womack Army Medical Center, Ft Bragg, NC; Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, NC; Heartland Region-Wright Patterson Air Force Base Medical Center, OH.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the LSA North (Owens & Minor).  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is August 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  
   
Point of Contact Robert Meinertzhagen, 757-953-2134, Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

The approximate total annual purchase volume of all types of Ostomy Supplies is $189,130 for the LSA North and is based upon the historical usage of standardized Ostomy Supplies over a one year period.  This is included as a reporting metric.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria.

At the request of the LSA North MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor

C.  Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your response to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your companys Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your companys responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companys base uncommitted DAPA pricing. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.   If required, any postal mailings should be sent to the following address: 

Robert Meinertzhagen
Tri-Service Regional Business Office
Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the TRBO via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.   Evaluation Criteria

The LSA North Tri-Service Product Review Boards (TPRB) are the governing boards of the standardization process. The boards include clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the LSA North. They are the decision makers for this initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The LSA North intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the LSA North).  Additionally, the LSA North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the LSA North may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs or respective TRBO/TPRB representative as appropriate.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the LSA North. Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor  offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the  vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the vendor has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the vendor has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the  vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Ostomy Supplies products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.   At a minimum, a complete product line includes:
Pre-cut and cut to fit wafers
      		Drainage pouches
		Adhesives, Deodorants, and Lubricants

Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.

2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Ostomy Supplies product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the LSA North.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the LSA North PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.  
5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative in each region comprising the LSA North.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Ostomy Supplies products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy with the initial submittal responding to this RFQ.

<a href="mailto:harold.buck@us.army.mil">Harold Buck</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&LLCMC) is conducting a market survey for the acquisition of a multi-purpose warhead with high accuracy electronic fuze for use on the 2.75 inch hydra rockets fired from Special Operations Forces (SOF) aviation platforms.  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project to qualify a multi-purpose penetrator warhead that is more effective against an array of targets to include buildings, bunkers and ships.  (A multi-purpose penetrator warhead is being qualified and this fuze must function with this warhead.)
(1) Penetration: When mounted on a MK66 rocket motor and fired, the warhead and fuze will penetrate 24 in of reinforced concrete and 4 ft of timber/earthen bunkers.  
(2) Non-Developmental / In Service Status: The multi-purpose warhead with high accuracy fuze must be non-developmental.
(3) Mass/CG Flight Characteristics:  When mounted on a Hydra rocket motor, the warhead will have a similar mass and center of gravity when compared to the M299/M151 warhead to insure that no need to change supporting fire control instrumentation (weapon racks) or effect ongoing spiral developments (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System).
(4) Incendiary Effect: The multi-purpose warhead must provide an incendiary effect to create secondary fires after impact.
(5) Fuze: The Fuze for the multi-purpose penetrator will be a variable delay settable fuze that is compatible with the current setter technology as used on MH60 and AH6 helicopters to insure that no change to the existing system needs to be made.  Fuze settings will enable the warhead to be initiated at variable times to account for the delay in penetrating different targets and to effectively engage exposed targets.  The delay settings will consist of a super-quick option for surface impact as well as a minimum of three delay options for light to medium penetration targets ranging from 1 to 10 ms  10% of set time.  The fuze must have a TRL of 7 to include demonstrating that the fuze functions with the current warhead.  If an alternate warhead is being produced it must have a TRL of 9.
(6) Facilities, Expertise and Safety:  These warheads and fuzes should meet stringent Navy WSESRB requirements/standards.  All the warheads with the fuze should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (IM characteristics), resistance to Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. 
Interested firms who believe that they are capable of providing a product that meets or exceeds the capabilities delineated in Items 1 thru 6 above are invited to indicate their interest by providing a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements.  This announcement does not constitute an invitation for bids or a request for proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this announcement. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this announcement.  Interested sources should submit the requested information not later than 11 June, 2008 to JM&L LCMC Acquisition Center, Attn:  Mr. Harold J.

<DESC>The Government is interested in obtaining information regarding a Scanning Electron Microscope System used to study the chemical and physical properties of concrete and other materials on the microscopic level. Analysis of the needs for the system requires imaging of nanosized, uncoated conductive samples of various materials including building materials, soils, etc. The ERDC requires that uncoated samples such as concrete be imaged.  Furthermore, research into nano-sized materials requires precise navigation to allow repeatability and consistency in measurement.  In addition, the ERDC requires imaging of samples at both high and low accelerating voltages to be able to not damage samples as well as be able to obtain quantitative chemical analysis.<BR><BR>The Government is interested in any vendor that can furnish and deliver the system with the following specifications:<BR><BR>1.	Schottky Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) that combines high- and low-voltage ultra-high resolution capabilities. A low-voltage BSE detector must be included to obtain superior contrast and compositional information.  It must have an immersion lens mode combined with low-vacuum that will allow for unique, ultra-high resolution, characterization in an environment that suppresses charge build-up on non-conductors without limiting the overall size of the specimen. Clean and contrasted imaging is required when imaging in low vacuum for those samples that suffer from residual surface contamination.<BR><BR>2.	The system must be equipped with a complete oil-free vacuum system. In addition, the gun section must be pumped by a two-stage ion getter pump and separated from the specimen chamber by an isolation valve. Through-the-lens differential pumping must be included to enable the use of two specimen chamber vacuum modes: high vacuum and low vacuum. Specimen exchange must be able to be made in a few minutes. The system must be able to be switched between two vacuum modes enabling the investigation of conductive, non-conductive and high-vacuum incompatible materials: High vacuum (typically 10-5 mbar) for imaging and microanalysis of conductive and/or conventionally prepared specimens; Low vacuum (up to 200 Pa chamber pressure) for imaging and microanalysis of non-conductive specimens without preparation or coating;<BR><BR>3.	The FESEM must be equipped with a 5-axes motorized x-y-z-rotate-tilt stage, of which x, y, and rotation movements are piezo-controlled. Movements provided must be: x = y = 150 mm (motorized); z = 10 mm (motorized); Tilt +60 to 5 degrees (motorized); Minimum step size is 100 nm; Repeatability at 0 degrees tilt is 1 m, and 2 m at greater than 50 degrees tilt. Stage control software must include standard facilities for: Store and recall of sample position; Double-click feature select function; Multi-directional stage drive; Rotation<BR><BR>4.	The Electron optics system features must include: The Schottky FEG gun, a high stability ultra-high brightness FE electron source with high beam current capability; A two-mode final lens, allowing for immersion and field-free operation. The field-free mode ensures undistorted, very low magnification imaging. In immersion mode, the highest resolution is achieved; Beam deceleration, which can be activated for getting higher surface sensitivity and contrast using low and very low landing energies down to 50 eV, must be implemented as an additional degree of freedom to optimize contrast and surface sensitivity while improving the optical performance of the electron column. <BR><BR>Source:    FEG with ultra-high brightness Schottky field emitter<BR>Voltage:  High voltage 200 V to 30 kV, continuously adjustable<BR>Landing energy:  50 V to 30 kV, continuously adjustable<BR>Beam Current:  Up to 100 nA<BR>Resolution:  High-vacuum: 1.0 nm @ 15 kV, 1.6 nm @ 1 kV with secondary electrons (SE); Low-vacuum: 1.8 nm @ 3 kV, with optional SE detector<BR><BR>5.	The system must have high-resolution digital scanning engine controlled from the user interface:<BR><BR>Resolution: 512x442, 1024x884, 2048x1768, 3584x3094 pixels<BR>Minimum dwell time: 50 ns/pixel<BR>Electronic scan rotation by n x 360 degrees<BR><BR>6.	The system must have an in-lens SE and BSE detection for high-resolution imaging at both high and low kVs, as well as an Everhart-Thornley SE detector for conventional SE detection. The balanced field extraction system of this in- the-lens detector must allow continuous mixing of SE and BSE electrons. This in-lens system allows TV rate BSE imaging to an accelerating voltage of 1 kV. For imaging of non-conductive or contaminating samples, the system must be equipped with an SE detector that directly detects SE from gas amplification, as opposed to indirect means of photomultiplier detectors,  and enables imaging in low vacuum at low high-tension values, giving maximum surface information and minimal contamination. An integrated IR-CCD camera for in-chamber viewing must be included.<BR><BR>7.	Images must be displayed in an area of 1024 x 884 pixels, configurable for single frame display or 4-quadrant (live) display. Images must be able to be viewed live, averaged or integrated. Images must be able to be saved in TIFF, BMP or JPEG file formats, and in 8-bit or 16-bit depth, to the hard disk  on a support computer provided with the system or LAN  (via the Support Computer) from the graphical user interface. Image printing must be available from the user interface.<BR><BR>This Sources Sought is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ). This Sources Sought is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this Sources Sought. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this Sources Sought.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Butterflies (used for Blood Collection and Intravenous Infusion).<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is August 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Butterflies (used for Blood Collection and Intravenous Infusion), which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $260,138.85.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  This is included as a reporting metric.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  21 gauge x  inch needle 12 inch tubing with adapter; 23 gauge x  inch needle 12 inch tubing with adapter; 23 gauge x  inch needle 12 inch tubing without adapter; 23 gauge x  inch needle 7 inch tubing with adapter; 25 gauge x  inch needle 12 inch tubing with adapter.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 3 June 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Mrs. Sarah Allen, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230. (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>  Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); 5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); 6) Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, National FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.  and 7) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will validate/approve the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<BR>1.	Vendor must provide a complete line of  Safety Butterflies.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the Safety Butterflies.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.   At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Safety Butterfly Blood Collection Sets and Safety Butterfly Intravenous Infusion Sets.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety Butterfly product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7, & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.  <BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are willing to provide quotes on discounts in response to this RFQ upon request.<BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number and e-mail address.  <BR>6.    Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all products to be supplied. Provide this information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFQ.  <BR>      7.  Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such<BR>requirements with the initial submittals.  Provide literature on the training.<BR>8.  Vendors products will have visible expiration date on the labeling.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the twenty-first calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 (threshold # may vary) for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0  <BR>1.	Ability to deploy safety feature with a single hand.<BR>a.	Clinicians require this to deploy safety feature with a single hand.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the Safety                                                               Butterfly on approximately 6 patients. <BR>c.	Product will be examined for ease of opening during use and evaluation.  <BR>2.	Audible or visual activation of safety feature is immediate. <BR>a.	Clinicians require this to know safety features have been deployed.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the Safety                                                               Butterfly on approximately 6 patients Clinicians will note the activation during the evaluation process. <BR>3.	Safety feature does not obscure visibility of needle for insertion. <BR>            a.   The safety feature impacts the amount of needle thats visible. <BR>      b.   This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the Safety                                                                   Butterfly on approximately 6 patients.<BR>c.   Clinicians will inspect this product to ensure the device is not bulky.  <BR>4.	Tubing is soft, flexible and does not have memory.<BR>a.   Clinicians require this feature to prevent coiling, kinking and tangling of tubing when removed from packaging.<BR> b.   This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the Safety                                                               Butterfly on approximately 6 patients.<BR> c.   Products will be applied and observed for ease of insertion and kinking during use and evaluation.<BR>            5.  Wing features are designed to add control.<BR>a.   Clinicians require this feature to provide stability of needle and prevent accidental needle sticks.<BR> b.   This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the Safety                                                               Butterfly on approximately 6 patients.<BR>c.    Products will be applied and observed for ease of insertion during use and  <BR> evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.  5) The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>

<DESC>This is NOT A Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposals.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The NAICS Code is 334220

This RFI is issued to survey the commercial market to determine the availability of potential solutions and commercial products available in the market.

Comments from industry are requested on the feasibility of the Statement of Objectives (SOO).  It is the Governments intent to procure a system with expandable capabilities.


United States Coast Guard Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Transmitter Recapitalization Project
Statement of Objectives (SOO)

1.0	Purpose:

The Maritime Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Service, operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, consists of 86 remote DGPS broadcast sites. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is interested in procuring, installing, and operating a proven, commercially available radiobeacon transmitter for the USCGs Maritime DGPS Service. 

2.0 Overall Objectives:
The USCGs Maritime DGPS Service provides navigation information for coastal areas, harbors and waterways in the continental U.S., the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, and portions of Alaska, Hawaii, and a greater part of the Mississippi River Basin. The correction signal is broadcasted on marine radiobeacon frequencies to improve the accuracy and integrity of GPS-derived positions.
As part of a multi-phased DGPS modernization project, the USCG is seeking technical information regarding available DGPS Radiobeacon Transmitters. The DGPS radiobeacon must be compatible with the existing DGPS architecture and must be capable of broadcasting accurate navigation correction messages. 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) mission requires a rapid phased deployment of the DGPS transmitter. The operational objective is to enhance system availability and reliability for maritime safety in critical waterways. 
With DGPS, the USCGs radiobeacon system meets the Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP) accuracy requirements for Harbor/Harbor Approach (HHA) navigation and international Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS). The existing USCG DGPS Service is required to deliver 10 meter accuracy, but typically delivers accuracies of 1-3 meters in all established coverage areas. For a system to be considered, it must meet the basic mission goals while maintaining an inherent ability to grow and improve in capability through next generational technological insertion and optional system enhancements. 
3.0 Scope:

The system will be installed as a sub-system which must integrate with the existing DGPS architecture. The system must fully integrate with legacy DGPS equipment and future DGPS upgrades. The system designed must incorporate open architecture methodology to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and non-proprietary commercial protocols. The system should minimize proprietary interfaces with outside sources or other proprietary systems without degrading the current baseline capabilities and requirements.

In an effort to execute the projects testing, procurement, and implementation goals, the vendor may be contracted to assist during the primary installation phases at remote DGPS sites. The USCG may exercise options to purchase additional units and/or services for remaining DGPS sites, DGPS training sites, and DGPS Testing and Research Facilities. 

4.0 Discussion:

The proposed DGPS Radiobeacon Transmitter system must consider the existing DGPS Transmitter system.

4.1 Baseline Requirements:

The DGPS Transmitter shall meet the following core requirements:

a)	System must be capable of broadcasting standard RTCM formatted DGPS signals to prescribed coverage areas using the carrier frequencies within the DGPS frequency range of 283.5325 kHz.

b)	The prospective DGPS Transmitter system shall interface with the DGPS architecture and must broadcast the DGPS navigation signal.

c)	The new system must be IP addressable. The transmitter must incorporate system controls via Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (TCP-IP) connectivity in conjunction with HyperText Markup Language (HTML) capability.

d)	Depending on the DGPS station location and broadcasted station identification code, the beacon transmitter must be capable of sending data at a rate of 100 or 200 bits per second with 50 ohms impedance.

e)	The new transmitter which combined with the existing system must meet DGPS availability requirements in accordance with COMDTINST M16577.1, April 1993, Broadcast Standard for the USCG.  (Including support for E3 and TEMPEST programs as described in paragraph 4.3.2.j. and k.) 

f)	The solution shall allow for full system operation from a remote location using message formatting compliant with the RTCM recommended standards for Differential NAVSTAR GPS reference stations and integrity monitor (RSIM) systems.  This standard stipulates that the Transmitter will receive, interpret, and transmit formatted messages for RSIM messages: 1, 2, 5, 24, 25, 26, and 27.

g)	The transmitter must have a dual transmitter design.                                 

h)	Each transmitter must provide a method of displaying actual operating hours (i.e. Elapsed Time Indicator (ETI), etc.). The display will measure the systems actual operating hours, and will be used to track the Mean Time between Failure (MTBF). 

i)	The selected system shall incorporate remote environmental monitoring.

4.2 Logistics and Logistics Support Objectives:

The USCG goal is to establish a dual maintenance concept with on-site CG organizational maintenance which may include contractor support for on-site system maintenance and repair.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science MissionDirectorate (SMD) plans to release for community comment a draft Announcement ofOpportunity (AO) for the third New Frontiers mission (NF-3) in September 2008.Approximately two weeks after the draft is released, SMD will hold a community workshopin the Washington, D.C., area. The final AO will be released in December 2008 withproposals due approximately 90 days later. In August 2009, up to three missions will beselected for a 9 to 11 month Phase A that will be funded up to $2.5M each. Downselectionto a single mission for flight will occur in fall (September to November) 2010. Launch isto occur no earlier than 2015 and no later than 2018. This NF-3 AO will solicit onlymissions that do not require nuclear sources for power generation or propulsion, althoughRadioisotope Heating Units (RHUs) and calibration sources will be allowed. The PrincipalInvestigator (PI) Mission Cost for all phases of the mission will not include the launchvehicle and will be capped at $650M in FY09 dollars.An Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) in the Intermediate Class with any of thefairing sizes available will be provided by NASA as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)at no charge against the capped PI Mission Cost. The Intermediate Class EELV that NASAwill provide can deliver up to 5,300 kg to an orbit with a launch energy of C3=10km2/sec2. Standard launch services will also be provided as GFE. Special or missionunique launch services above those included in the standard launch services must beincluded within the PI Mission Cost.No minimum experience qualifications will be required of the PI, but the experience andexpertise of the proposing team will be an evaluation factor for the evaluation ofsubmitted NF proposals. With the cancellation of minimum PI experience requirements, NASAhas terminated prescreening for compliance with the cancelled requirements. NASA will follow recommendations 1 and 2 of the National Research Council's (NRC's) NewOpportunities for Solar System Exploration (NOSSE) committee report available at:http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12175     .Recommendation 1: In drafting the rules for the NF-3 AO, NASA should emphasize thescience objectives and questions to be addressed, not specify measurements or techniquesfor the implementation. Recommendation 2: NASA should expand the list of potential missions in the NF-3 AO toinclude the three remaining candidate missions: South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return,Venus In Situ Explorer, and the Comet Surface Sample Return, and also the five additionalmedium-sized missions mentioned in the decadal survey: Network Science; Trojan/CentaurReconnaissance; Asteroid Rover/Sample Return; Io Observer; and Ganymede Observer. Thereis no recommended priority for these missions. NASA should select from this set ofmissions based both on science priority and overall mission viability. This NF-3 AO will not provide a funding profile. Proposals are to propose the optimumfunding profile for the mission consistent with the cap on PI Mission Cost and are tospecify the duration and budget requirements for Phases B through F (Closeout).The cost of using the Deep Space Network (DSN) must be included within the PI MissionCost. Except for emergencies and critical events (e.g., Entry, Descent, and Landing) whencontinuous coverage is required, DSN use will be limited to a single 34 m DSN antenna ata time. Missions are encouraged to consider the use of Ka band as appropriate.Proposers will be given the option of selecting none or one of two specific technologiesfor insertion into their mission. The two technologies are the NASA Evolutionary XenonThruster (NEXT) and the Advanced Materials Bipropellant Rocket (AMBR) engine. Formissions that insert NEXT, the cap on the PI Mission Cost will be raised up to $15M. Formissions that insert AMBR, the cap on the PI Mission Cost will be raised up to $5M. Theappropriate use of these technologies will be evaluated and could affect the risk ratingof the proposals. However, the inherent risk of these technologies has been accepted byNASA and will not affect the evaluated risk rating of the proposals; all proposers willreceive feedback on the use of the new technology. Once that feedback has beenincorporated into the Concept Study Reports (CSRs) of the missions selected for Phase A,both the appropriate use and the inherent risk of these technologies will be evaluatedand could affect the risk rating of the CSRs. Any PI considering the use of either ofthese technologies should contact David J. Anderson of NASA Glenn Research Center atdavid.j.anderson@nasa.gov.The cost of complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for RHUs andcalibration sources must be included within the PI Mission Cost.Proposals must not designate an Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) lead or describe anE/PO plan. Designation of an E/PO lead and development of an E/PO plan is to be doneduring Phase A. Proposals must allocate a budget for E/PO that does not exceed 1% of thePI Mission Cost and proposals must contain a commitment by the PI to provide an E/PO planif selected.Questions may be addressed to Dr. Adriana C. Ocampo, New Frontiers Program Executive,Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-2152; Email:aco@nasa.gov.

U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing (Drones, Miscellaneous Aircraft Accessories, and Components; Aircraft Launching Equipment).
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing (Drones, Miscellaneous Aircraft Accessories,  and Components; Aircraft Launching Equipment).
According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBAs 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-205-7408; by FAX at (202) 481-4783; or by email at Pamela.McClam@sba.gov 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBAs 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBAs regulations at 13 CFR 121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing (Drones, Miscellaneous Aircraft Accessories,  and Components; Aircraft Launching Equipment).

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336413. Product Service Codes 1550,  1680, 1720. 
The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionRequesting Agency: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)Patient Health Care and Enrollment Services1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772Contracting Activity:Department of Veterans AffairsCorporate Data Center Operations (CDCO)Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) (200/00D)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772Project Background:In October 1996, Congress enacted the Veteran's Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-262, which required Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to implement a priority based enrollment system. The Enrollment program includes functionality to process veteran's applications for enrollment, share veteran's eligibility and enrollment data with all VA health care facilities involved in the veteran's care, manage veterans' enrollment correspondence and telephone inquires, and support national reporting and analysis of enrollment data. The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Legacy system handles this functionally. In August 2008, ESR 3.0 will replace the legacy system in order to provide greater flexibility to meet critical requirements on a timely basis, better safeguards to meet security requirements, and improved reliability.This program also encompasses Income Verification Matching (IVM) functionality, which verifies certain veterans' self-reported income information with the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) federal tax information to identify veterans' responsibility for making medical care co-payments and to enhance revenue from first party collections. ESR 4.0 will replace the IVM 2.9 system, and will include a workflow component to create, assign, view, track, and complete work items. This program also encompasses HEC IT Operations support. On July 19, 2004, the VA's Health Eligibility Center (HEC), part of the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), located in Atlanta, GA, in conjunction with the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T)- Enrollment division purchased these ILOG JRules developmental licenses under Contract GS-35F0330J, Purchase Order 742-A40034 with Immix Technology. Before the procurement execution, HEC and OI&T conducted extensive market research for the best product and value to the Government. A technical evaluation was prepared identifying and recommending the business rules engine for the development of the Enrollment system for the HEC. Two different software products (ILOG - JRules and Fair Isaac - Blaze Advisor) were selected for this technical evaluation. These products were short listed from a larger selection of rules engines. The technical evaluation included the following: a) Implementing the provided business rules (Subset of Eligibility and Enrollment Rules); b) Demonstrating and presenting products using the provided business rules; and c) Evaluating on a set of criteria. The technical evaluation recommended the use of a Business Rules engine over embedding the rules in code for the following reasons: 1) Rules Maintenance; 2) Rules Validation; 3) Rules Development. Nature and/or description of the action:  This is a request for a firm fixed priced delivery order under National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP IV) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for the following: Procurement of ILOG, Inc. licenses to transition from Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) development licenses to production ESR licensesProcurement of additional licenses for development serversMaintenance of these licensesAITC is directed to procure software on NASA SEWP IV through a memorandum from the Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology dated June 1, 2007 which made the NASA SEWP contract mandatory for all VA offices. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs The ESR project is a Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE) modernization, rehosting and re-engineering of the legacy Health Eligibility Center's enrollment application and processes. The VA currently owns ILOG licenses and maintenance support of these licenses which are for a pre-production state that covers software development, testing, and annual maintenance support. This requirement is to procure ILOG Inc., JRules production licenses which transition the Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) version (v) 3.0 software from a pre-production state to a production state.  ILOG JRules software is used to create human readable/writable business rules that are translated into Java code. These licenses are perpetual license which means that the VA buys these one time and the licenses are good forever (exclusive of the annual maintenance fee). The manufacturer of this product is ILOG, Inc. and they have numerous resellers of these products. In order to be compatible with the existing ILOG, Inc. installation, only ILOG, Inc. brand name products can be purchased to upgrade to the licenses. No substitution in manufacturer (brand name/or model) is acceptable.  The question is not whether another manufacture's product works with ILOG's licenses. ILOG is a business rules engine that works with VA's application. This solicitation is not considered for issuance as brand name or equal. In order to remove these products (licenses) now and use another product, this would require full development cycle replete with recoding, regression testing, user acceptance testing, integration testing, and deployment.  This would take up to a year and likely would cost an additional $4,000,000.00.An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.     FAR 6.302-1(c) Application for brand name description.   Citation: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. The ILOG JRules software is already installed on the current servers and is highly integrated with the business service layer of the actual ESR v 3.0 code. Selecting a new product at this time would require a complete recoding of the business service layer of the software which easily equates to an additional year of a coding, testing, and software release cycle.  Costs associated with this would exceed $4,000,000.00 in resources alone and would delay the release of subsequent, mission critical congressionally mandated software to support the Global War On Terrorism.Therefore, the VA purchased and implemented ILOG Jrules into the Enrollment System Redesign product. Since this product already exists in the VA's system, no other manufacturer's products could be used to upgrade the licenses or provide additional licenses to expand capacity. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  A notice of this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities System (FedBizOpps). To meet the fair opportunity provisions of the SEWP IV contract, a posting will be publicized on NASA SEWP request for quotations site. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The anticipated proposed prices are based on previously-negotiated prices under a current government contract which are already determined to be fair and reasonable.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Market research for ILOG, Inc. resellers on NASA SEWP resulted in two contract holders (GMRI PCMG and Merlin). GMRI PCMG's products/CLINs/part number did not meet the Government's requirements. Merlin's products/CLINs/part numbers did meet the Government's requirements. Market research for ILOG, Inc. resellers for ILOG Jrules on GSA IT 70 contract resulted in one contract holder (immixTechnology). immixTechnology's products/part numbers did meet the Government's requirements.ILOG, Inc. also has numerous partners for open market procurements. Their types of partners include: software (39 partners), service (38 partners), channel (11 partners), technology (5 partners), and association (15 partners).  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: This information technology (IT) procurement request is integral to the Enrollment System Redesign and the Enrollment program as a whole. These costs are part of the life-cycle costs included in the Enrollment Enhancement OMB exhibit through 2013. The above referenced brand named products available, in the case of this follow-on contract, are part of a major system. This is an upgrade to license status and additional licenses. The substantial duplication of cost to the Government would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition. In addition, there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.   Request for quotation has not been posted yet to NASA SEWP.A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  Continual market research is being conducted by the program office to identify other contractors that can meet the agencies needs.  The VA continues to research using brand name or equal on subsequent solicitations. In addition, the VA continues to research the possibilities of procuring the re-procurement rights to the software.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web
ite at http://wdol.gov/.
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

JUSTIFICATION: The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Sole Source basis for modular furniture to include design and installation.  Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC) has a requirement for reconfiguration of an existing Haworth modular furniture workstations and to include associated component parts/accessories to match existing and therefore the new workstations must be compatible with existing areas for interchangeability.  No other modular furniture will interface with Haworth Furniture. Haworth has provided modular furniture and accessories since 1989, which equates to over 2000 Haworth workstations.  HQ AFPC averages approximately 10-15 reconfiguration projects per year. Haworth is the only known manufacturer of modular furniture that offers the versatility, flexibility, and adaptability that meets HQ AFPC fluid mission needs.  Haworth is the only modular furniture that offers both quick horizontal and vertical change through incremental panels, therefore reducing future reconfigurations costs significantly.  Additionally, with the number of Haworth workstations already installed in the building, new workstations must be compatible with existing areas for interchangeability.  The approximate total replacement value cost is $10,000,000.00; the government would not be able to recoup these costs in a competitive environment.  Therefore, it would not be in the Governments best interest to procure from another manufacturer. This could result in an adverse effect by negating any existing warranties on the current system.

However, the quote of a business with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The offeror is to provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.<BR> <BR>This announcement will close at 3:00 PM local time, 19 May 2008.

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Harris HF Communications Equipment. AF/RSA-ACOTA has identified that the Harris HF Communications equipment is an essential component of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) UNAMID contingents communication suite. The equipment listed is required to complement Harris communications equipment already in use by the ENDF in UNAMID (Darfur) and replace damaged and missing components of the communication equipment already in use.  Reliable communications is an essential element of the ENDFs performance in Darfur.  Provision of equipment other than the type already in use by the ENDF would result in maintenance, supply and   operational interoperability problems that would diminish the performance of the ENDF contingent in Darfur.  The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the product identified by brand name herein has been the primary communication system used by the ACOTA trained Ethiopian military in support of the UN peacekeeping operations in Darfur (UNAMID).  The Harris HF Communications equipment has been proven to be a worthy piece of equipment for the ENDF.  Any other communication system will not meet the sustainment goals of replacement of damage or missing components, the training for the use and care of this specialized equipment that is already in use by the deployed peacekeeping force as the Harris HF Communications equipment is the primary items written in these solicitation.The requirement will be competed as the field support community responds to price requests on Fed Bid.There is no other manufacture of the listed equipment so market research was not conducted. It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fed Bid process.<BR><BR>

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Dont use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. R to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Price

Technical and delivery, when combined, are ____N/A______when compared to price.

Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

The vendor will provide prompt payment discount terms in their proposal.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

	If editing is required, update the first submission; dont create a second invoice submission.

	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Dont use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. R to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a months worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:Commandant (CG-9131)

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>The 950th Electronic Systems Group (950 ELSG), Hanscom AFB, MA, is issuing a sources sought for the purpose of obtaining information for the sustainment of Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS) systems to include: hardware maintenance, software maintenance, and potential updates to DIS commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware baseline to provide new capabilities. Eagle Vision is the only deployable commercial ground station in DOD that can directly receive and process panchromatic/multispectral/SAR imagery from commercial remote-sensing satellites. Eagle Vision provides imagery products for military operations, disaster relief and homeland defense, especially for use in combat commander mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems. DIS imagery output includes both industry standard and government-specific output formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG 2000, NITF 2.1, and RPF CIB. The DIS resides at each of five geographically-separated Eagle Vision sites: Ramstein Air Base Germany, San Diego, CA, Eastover, SC, Honolulu, HI, and Montgomery, AL. Each DIS system comprises six independent workstations (mix of desktops and laptops), a Local Area Network (LAN), shared storage devices, printers, and plotters. Each workstation contains multiple commodity COTS applications software for imagery, office automation, and geospatial processing applications, including Leica's ERDAS Imagine and ESRI's ArcGIS. The sustainment effort will also support one workstation with all DIS software at the Air Force Combat Support Office (AFCSO) in the Pentagon, Washington, DC. Additional informational about the locations and hardware/software configuration of the DIS systems may be found on the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB), http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/. Under business opportunities, choose systems/Hanscom for type and location. The inform! ation can be found under Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS) Sustainment.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), conducts research on marine mammals important to the mission of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and NOAA, with particular attention to issues related to marine mammals off the coasts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. The North Pacific right whale Eubalaena Japonica was severely depleted by whaling in the past two centuries. The current size of the eastern population is estimated at fewer than 100 individuals and this stock is considered critically endangered; its current distribution is known only from records in a relatively limited area of the southeastern Bering Sea, and from a few occurrences in the Gulf of Alaska. Historical catch and sighting data indicate that right whales were abundant and widely distributed in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska in summer and early autumn. The NMML has a requirement for the performance of aerial surveys to determine distribution and abundance of cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin. The aerial surveys shall take place in the North Aleutian Basin in the Bering Sea during the months of July and August 2008 and 2009, focusing on the regions currently designated as Right Whale critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act, and proposed oil and gas sale lease areas in the Southeastern Bering Sea. The Government will provide the survey aircraft. Reconnaissance flights and line transect surveys will be flown to determine, through observation, the distribution and abundance of North Pacific Right Whales and other cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin. When encountered, Right Whales and other large cetaceans shall be photographed. The aerial surveys will require an experienced scientific team comprised of a Project Coordinator/Principle Investigator, Field Project Leader and three Observers. The Principle Investigator must demonstrate knowledge of aerial survey methodology. The Principle Investigator and Field Project Leader shall plan and coordinate the aerial surveys in consultation with NMML to determine the survey effort area. Observers shall have experience photographing and identifying marine mammals from aircraft, and be familiar with computer software used to collect sightings, survey conditions, and position data. The vendor shall compile the survey data, photographic images, and provide final field reports and raw data (including photographic images) to NMML within two months of the end of the survey for each survey period. Deliverables will include electronic files containing all raw data including photographic images, a report summarizing all survey effort, sightings, and environmental conditions. This procurement is open to all interested parties. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency. For this procurement, the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract. The period of performance is for one (1) base year with one (1) additional one-year option period.

The purpose of this modification is to answer a question from a potential offeror and to revise the instructions on white paper submissions.

1. Q. Is the coating this solicitation is seeking meant for application to the landing deck of the ships exclusively or does the NRL also want submissions presenting coating/lining solutions for other areas of the ship where non-skid is desired e.g. stairs, mechanical areas, etc.?

    A. The NRL has two areas of interest, one being the high temperature flight deck area and the other an advanced performance G general grade ( for decks) under the mil spec.

2. White papers should only be submitted to Dr. James Martin and Dr. Airan Perez as refrenced in the previous notice.
