<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

<CONTACT>Kate Puckett Hydrology Supervisor 5095755848205  kpuckett@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office, Yakima Field Office, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Loren Kjelgaard to assist the Yakima Field Office, by providing technical and other services, in summarizing and documenting materials related very specifically to Yakima Project operations and past decisions on Yakima Project operations.    The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b).  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) operates the Yakima Irrigation Project, a multi-purpose project that delivers approximately 2.5 million acre feet of water per year to about one-half million acres of farm land in south central Washington. The Yakima Field Office (YFO)  plans and directs Project reservoir and river operations by collecting and analyzing current hydrologic and operational data, forecasting probable runoff conditions, determining irrigation diversion requirements, and scheduling flood routings and water deliveries for daily operations.  The Project is operated according to State and Federal water rights, Contracts, multiple Court Orders, and procedures that have developed over a long history with considerable controversy.  Assistance is requested from Mr. Loren Kjelgaard to support project operations in the following areas: 1)summarize and document methods related to rationing water (volume vs rate; period of calculating rationing; use of water blocks; total water supply available (TWSA) 2) build files and summarize information (as pertinent to current Yakima Project operations) on Conditional Final Orders, Contracts and amendments, Court Orders related to operations, authorities, winter flows, smolt passage flows, power subordination, TWSA, drought operations, flood operations, flip flop operation, ramping rates, water transfers, and other issues; 3) document methods related to tracking diversions and compliance with entitlements and suggest improvements; 4) summarize and document data management processes; 5) Assist in updating entitlement tables ; and 6)summarize and document hydromet facilities, sites, equipment, and equipment age.  "Documenting" means locating relevant data, court materials, hydromet or other hydrology data, hydrology operation notes, YFO letters or correspondence, or any other materials that were used to make past decisions related to current operations.    Mr. Loren Kjelgaard has key knowledge and vital experience specifically related to Yakima Project operations as follows: Specific knowledge of Reclamation Yakima Project issues in Yakima Basin adjudication, including court orders, conditional final orders, 1945 Consent Decree, and settlement agreements. Key knowledge of how the Yakima Project operates: total water supply available estimates, Yakima Project contracts, water rights, drought operations, flood operations, in stream flow target development, specific operations procedures related to data management (such as records work up procedures, data editing procedures, and hydromet procedures), Yakima Project operations (flip flop, mini flip flop, entitlements, measurement & reporting), and history of the Yakima Project operations.   This key knowledge is understood with sufficient depth to carry out the requested tasks.   This knowledge was gained by working directly for the Yakima Project in several different capacities for a period of many years.  The immediate objective is to get this work accomplished during fiscal year 2004 because of possible changes linked, in part, to the progress of the Yakima Basin adjudication.   Pressure from both within and outside Reclamation are forcing us to evaluate Yakima Project operations; in order to do this the current operations, methods, and decisions must be thoroughly understood and documented.    Mr. Kjelgaard's extensive knowledge of the Yakima Project adjudication and detailed knowledge of the Yakima Project will require minimal start-up time and minimal involvement of Yakima Project staff.   The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Supporting evidence must be furnished, insufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business February 6, 2004, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Goverment not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Goverment. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attn. Connie Morgan, or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov@pn.usbr.gov. Original Point of Contact: Katheryn Puckett, kpuckett@pn.usbr.gov

<DESC>The MURI program supports basic science and/or engineering research at institutions of higher education (hereafter referred to as “universities”) that is of critical importance to national defense.  This special targeted competition is specifically for the topic of  High Confidence Real-time Anomaly and Misuse Detection within Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and High Confidence, Adaptable Software (SW).

A detailed description of the topic can be found in Section VIII SPECIFIC MURI TOPIC of this BAA.  The detailed description is intended to provide the proposer a frame of reference and is not meant to be restrictive to the possible approaches to achieving the goals of the topic and the program.  Innovative ideas addressing this research topic are highly encouraged.

Proposals from a team of university investigators may be warranted because the necessary expertise in addressing the multiple facets of the topics may reside in different universities, or in different departments in the same university.  Proposals must name one Principal Investigator as the responsible technical point of contact.  Similarly, one institution will be the primary awardee for the purpose of award execution.  The relationship among participating institutions and their respective roles, as well as the apportionment of funds including sub-awards, if any, must be described in both the proposal text and the budget.

Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) (as defined by 10 U.S.C. 2323a (1) (c)) are encouraged to participate in the MURI program, either as the lead institution or as a member of a team.  However, no specific funds are allocated for HBCU/MI participation.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price contract to SECOR International Incorporated, Golden, Colorado for a pilot test and optional full scale implementation of a technology for remediation of hazardous waste at the FHWA Materials Lab.  The objective of this contract is to test and implement a remediation technology available for accomplishing bedrock contamination cleanup at the site on the Denver Federal Center.  

The FHWA Materials Lab at Building 52 on the Denver Federal Center experienced a release from a former underground storage tank of TCA (trichloroethane) solvent in 1988.  Interim measures have been undertaken to clean up the site including hydraulic containment of the highly contaminated groundwater in both shallow and deep groundwater units by a groundwater pump and treat system.  CFLHD now proposes to enter into a contract to pilot test a compressed gas remediation technology (not soil vapor extraction) in saturated fractured bedrock, as well as options for a full-scale system including operations and maintenance to accomplish a final source area remediation at the Materials Lab.  

This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements. GSA Federal Supply Schedule may also be utilized in contracting for this work. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications specifically to perform the identified technology in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on February 11, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Order DTFH68-04-F-00059 will be issued to SECOR International on or about  February 16, 2004, with a response due no earlier than February 23, 2004. Contract award will not be made before February 27, 2004.  Alternate contact is John Hunt, Contract Specialist, email john.hunt@fhwa.dot.gov, fax (303) 969-5971.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) uses graphic design services to support an extensive range of publications and reports.  As an expression of Design Excellence, most of the new work should complement the quality and design strategies already developed for the OCA.

In addition, the portfolio shall include a statement (no more than three pages) articulating the lead designer’s design philosophy, approach to projects, and commitment to the work of the GSA Public Buildings Service Office of the Chief Architect.  The lead designer’s resume shall also be included.  Offerors shall concisely summarize the size, number of employees, experience, and technical capabilities of the firm and all potential subcontractors.  Offerors shall describe how projects are managed, the interaction with the client and subcontractors, the process used to develop and refine designs, and the strategies for managing schedule and costs.  

Proposals meeting minimum requirements will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation factors: (1) Past Performance in Design as Demonstrated in the Lead Designer’s Portfolio (2) Past Performance in Project Management; and (3) Experience and Professional/Technical Capabilities.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE:  This requirement is for the procurement of a qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Alterations and Building Upgrade of the Norris Cotton Federal Building, Manchester, NH.  The facility is a seven story building over two basement parking levels, with a total of 14,325 square meters.  The building exterior façade is constructed of granite and insulated aluminum panels with small operable windows.  The work includes but is not limited to demolition; alterations; installation and commissioning of new roof; replacement of windows with a new curtain wall system; new entrance; finishes, HVAC systems, power distribution, lighting, telephone and data components, lightning protection, fire protection, energy management systems, fire alarm; asbestos abatement, and tenant space fit-up.  The project will be completed in two phases to accommodate a partial occupancy by the government during construction, with disruptive work being performed after normal business hours. This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is 36 months.

The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on phased occupied renovations & alterations.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $10 million dollars or more and/or phased construction renovation projects in occupied buildings of approximately $10 million dollars or more. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the “best value” to the Government in terms of price and technical merit,  and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach,  subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.   

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing
    phased/building occupied construction projects.
3  Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan including management control, quality 
    assurance, coordination and small business category goals.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Applied Ordnance Technology, Inc., 103 Paul Mellon Court Ste. A, Waldorf, MD, 20602-2747.  The proposed procurement will provide support for implementation and use of the Advanced Modular Gun Demonstrator (AMGD) which is a test gun based on the XLR (Extended Long Range) gun design developed under SBIR N96-268.  This contract covers the Phase IV effort that defines the follow on work required for the design, development, engineering, fabrication, and testing of gun components, projectiles and propellant for the AMGD program.  This contract includes the associated program management, engineering, manufacturing, testing, and logistic support planning requirements.  The contract is principally for the support of PEOIWS3C technology efforts.  The AMGD program is intended to pr ovide a technology transition test bed for future gun and projectile innovations.  The goal is to provide a versatile, gun test platform for the U.S. Navy to further explore advanced gun technology in the areas of materials, ballistics, projectiles, wear, and erosion.  Applied Ordnance Technology, Inc. (AOT) and Advanced Power Technology, Inc. (APTI) own a joint patent (Pat. No: 6,571,676) on the XLR design.  Also, the amount of time required for any other company to gain the necessary knowledge would present an unacceptable delay to the program, while incurring greater costs to the program.   The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren Laboratory Procurement Division has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area; therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/ww wDL/XD/SUPPLY.  DoD will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR Web site at http://www.ccr.gov.  A paper registration form may be obtained from the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>The National institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting proposals from small business concerns having the capabilities to provide independent review and assessment of pathology and clinical pathology.   Such review provides feedback to NIEHS regarding areas that could be improved, such as slide quality, tissue accountability, necropsy documentation, consistency of terminology and diagnosis, etc. at the testing facilities and helps identify special pathology issues that may need to be addressed in pathology conferences.
          Based on the number of studies in progress, projected study starts, and number of studies to be peer reviewed, it is estimated that twenty-four 2-year studies, twenty 90-day studies and six genetically modified mouse (GMM) model studies will be reviewed under this contract per year.  From past experience it is estimated that approximately  15,000 rodents will be involved in studies to be reviewed on an annual basis.  For 2-year studies an average of 14 slides are produced per animal, including approximately 52 tissue sections.  It is estimated that approximately 20 percent of all histologically prepared tissues from each study or approximately150,000 tissues will be evaluated for QA per year.  In addition, since nearly all 90 day studies have clinical pathology results, it is estimated that clinical pathology results will need to be evaluated for 20 studies per year, with 20% of the slides reviewed for QA. The Contractor shall have the ability to provide pathology service for toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.  This includes evaluation of pathology records, evaluation of the pathology diagnoses and comparison with the histological material and evaluation of clinical pathology specimens and clinical pathology data.  It also includes evaluation and reporting on the utility of the peer review process, as well as providing reports and continuing education relative to issues identified during peer review.  The studies to be evaluated are currently on test and additional studies will be started under the National Toxicology Program (NTP) during the period of the contract.  Tasks to be performed under this contract include: Task 1 – Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs); Task 2 – Pre-QA Pathology Data Review (PDR);  Task 3 – Audit of Pathology Materials;  Task 4 – Clinical Pathology Data Quality Assessment;  Task 5 – Anatomic Pathology Data Quality Assessment; and Task 6 – Quality Assessment-related Activities.  
	The prospective contractor shall have or be willing to establish offices, equipment, and technical facilities, including laboratory facilities, within twenty minutes driving time of NIEHS and the NTP Archive, both are located in the Research Triangle Park, NC, for the duration of the contract period of performance.  The requirements of the contract necessitate the contractor’s frequent (once or twice daily) trips to the NTP Archive and the NIEHS for delivery and pickup of pathology slides and data.  The contractor staff shall be required to attend meetings of the Pathology Working Group (PWG).  Most of the contractor pathologists shall attend periodic continuing symposia at the NTP that will be held at the NIEHS or in the immediate vicinity.  The contractor Principal Investigator shall frequently visit the Project Officer at the NIEHS to discuss progress issues and problems.  Award of one cost reimbursement, completion type contract is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The resulting contract shall consist of a base period of four years with three optional periods consisting of two years each, for a total of ten years if all options are exercised.  Performance based contracting methods  will be used to determine the exercise of options.   Requests for this solicitation must reference RFP Number NIH-ES-04-05, and must be directed to the office listed above.  Expected release date of this RFP is February 18, 2004 with proposals due on April 6, 2004.  See Numbered Notes 1 and 26.*******

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the University of Michigan, School of Public Health for the acquisition of  professional services in identifying potential participants for the EPA Detroit Exposure and Aerosol Research Study (DEARS)  aimed at measuring personal exposures and indoor concentrations of PM and air toxins. The study will take place in Wayne County, Michigan with several different monitoring areas throughout the  county. Because of environmental concerns related to source emissions and health effects on residents in Detroit, there are several community groups that are instrumental in assisting with identifying participants for the DEARS. Researchers at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health  (UM-SPH) have conducted personal exposure studies in Detroit and developed innovative community-based participatory research approaches to involve these same community groups to help recruit participants. As a result, strong relationships have been forged between UM-SPH and the community groups in  the area. This contract will capitalize on the previously established  relationships between UM-SPH and the community groups in Detroit and allow EMAB to engage in community-based participatory research to recruit participants for the DEARS during the first year of the study. Researchers at UM-SPH  will work through community groups to aid in selecting homes and individuals in several key areas that we have already been identified for possible monitoring. The EPA has identified the University of Michigan, School of Public Health, as the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement in order  to ensure study completeness and accuracy. The circumstance permitting soliciting from a "single source" is FAR 13.106-1(b) .  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided  the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of  this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Ardra Morgan-Kelly (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Pending acceptance of the First Article(s), the balance will then be awarded to the best value offeror.

<DESC>This amendment is to clarify requirements and extend the due date for the Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) for Eastern and Western Range Spaceports, posted to Federal Business Opportunities web page on 3 Oct 03, Reference Number 3. This requirement is similar to four Multiple Award, IDIQ contracts let in 1996 by the Air Force Research Laboratory for the Space and Missile Systems Center's Launch Test Program. These contracts were for spaceport services for potential launches from Cape Canaveral, FL; Vandenburg AFB, CA; Wallops Island, VA; and Kodiak, AK. The basic requirement centers on the providing facilities (e.g. buildings, launch pad) to support a build up of a launch vehicle (tasks which are mainly performed by a contractor providing launch services under a different contract), and the actual launch of the vehicle. The facilities must have licenses or demonstrate the ability to obtain licenses from appropriate authorities to perform launches of suborbital and orbital vehicles (e.g, from FAA.) "Eastern and Western Range", as used for this acquisition, refers to the eastern and western coasts of the United States, including Alaska. There is a possibility that the contracts will require a facility clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance, and appropriately cleared individuals, to handle classified information. Electronic submissions of Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) are acceptable, to be sent to Mr. Larry Melancon at larry.melancon@kirtland.af.mil. The due date for SOCs is extended to 3 Nov 03.

<DESC>AETC CONS and the 71st FTW will host an Industry Forum at Vance AFB, OK on 4 Aug 1999.  The purpose of the forum is twofold:  (1) for the government to provide information about the upcoming re-competition of the Vance AFB aircraft maintenance and BOS services and (2) for industry to provide information that can assist the government in writing a requirement that will result in a contract that will best meet the government's needs.

The forum will begin at 0830 and consist of a mission briefing, an overview of the service areas and an explanation of the source selection process.  The second half of the day will be devoted to one-on-one question and answer sessions scheduled with each prospective offeror group.  Each session should last 45 minutes to one hour.

Format for one-on-one sessions: Please categorized questions into "public" and  "private" exchanges.  The public exchanges are solicitation clarification questions.  These will be addressed first and may be shared with other offerors or the final solicitation may reflect changes as a result of these exchanges.  The private portion will be used to discuss issues that are proprietary.  Anything discussed during the private period will be held confidential and will not be shared with other offerors.

Please notify Terry J. Lazenby, procurement contracting officer at terry.lazenby@randolph.af.mil or fax 210-652-7665 no later than 26 Jul 99 of the names and titles of those who will be attending the Forum.  Please indicate in your e-mail if your company would like a one-on-one session.   The appointment times will be arranged via telephone upon receipt of your request.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the fulfillment of Public Law 2319 and is the periodic announcement of a Qualification Requirement, which is available for the manufacture of the F-16 Circuit Card Assembly, 2nd IF AMP-Receiver/STALO Assembly, NSN: 5998-01-383-0065WF, part number 12607652.  The 2nd IF Amplifier Board Assembly is part of F16-Radar Receiver Assembly.  The Receiver mixes, amplifies, and conditions the first IF signal from the LNA and applies it to the Sample Data Assembly as the I and Q video signals.  The first IF signal passes through an Image Reject Filter to the second mixing stage where it is mixed with LO2 oscillator that came from the Transmit Microwave.  The 2nd IF produced is close to the frequency of the 3rd local oscillator and is passed through a bandpass amplifier to the Noise Gain Control Section.  The 2nd IF signal out of the Bang Snuff Circuitry is input to a bandpass filter centered at the 3rd LO frequency. 

Although the F-16 Logistics Operation Division does not have an immediate requirement, this notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  

Interested parties may request a source qualification statement from Joe Refahiyat, (801) 775-4602, javad.refahiyat@hill.af.mil.  Request any engineering data in support of this synopsis by contacting OO-ALC/LGVED, Sheila Gunn.  The request can be emailed to Sheila.Gunn@hill.af.mil or faxed to (801)-777-9092.

<DESC>Capable sources are sought to satisfy requirements for Air Force Disaster Recovery Systems at operational commands' DoD Intelligence Community sites for the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP). This program will permit disaster recovery plans to be implemented at each command encompassing processes and procedures that address system design, development, integration, testing and evaluation for the purposes of remote (nominal 100+ miles) replication of digital mission critical and mission essential GDIP funded data, servers and applications to prevent their loss should a disaster occur.  Site requirements will be analyzed through systems analysis and tradeoff studies, architecture analysis and design, and system feasibility/impact studies to evaluate candidate subsystems for inclusion in customized Disaster Recovery (DR) Systems augmenting existing infrastructures. System Architectures for specific sites will be developed, including proposed hardware and software, adapted to the sites’ unique architectures. Site visits will be made, as necessary, to conduct surveys of site requirements, existing infrastructure and plans. Detailed implementation plans will be developed to document approved configurations and design and to guide the implementation, installation, initial data load, test and initial operating capability for each site. Assistance will be provided to the sites for security accreditation purposes following certification testing.  An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (I.D.I.Q,) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - Completion type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of forty-eight (48) months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is $48,000,000.00. The prime contractor, system integrators, and subcontractors for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to identify the capability of any firms that can provide and install a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) at the EPA in Cincinnati, OH, to track laboratory samples in a biosafety level-3 laboratory in which bacteria, protozoan and virological analyses are potential.  Because of biocontainment requirements and safety concerns, documentation of sample analyses on paper is not permitted.  Both forensic and research samples will be tracked with this software.  Because of the forensic nature of some of the samples, electronic documentation must be of the utmost quality.  The software system must possess the following characteristics:  

1) It must operate on a Microsoft platform and be able to operate on an isolated LAN.
2) It must be intuitive and user friendly, so analysts with weak computer skills can operate it.  
3) It must be adaptable (programable to changing needs) to allow numerous assays for different microorganisms to be incorporated.  
4)  It must maintain or document chain of custody and be defensible in court.  
5) It must maintain information about the client and contact information about the client. 
6) It should require minimal effort to maintain the system.  
7) It must allow multiple users to enter data simultaneously in various laboratory locations.  
8) It should permit labeling and data input by bar code.  
9) It should track the location of the sample and how much of the sample remains.  
10) It should generate reports to the client.

The applicable NAICS code is 541511, computer program or software development.

Any interested firm should submit a capability statement,  which clearly demonstrates the firm’s ability to provide a software system that can perform the functions described above.  A description of previously developed systems, that are similar to that described above, shall be provided, along with reference information.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   In the capabilities statements, contractors must indicate their businesses size and status (ie - certified 8(a) firm, small, small disadvantaged, or large business).  Responses to the above should be submitted electronically via e-mail to the attention of Kathleen Roe at roe.kathleen@epa.gov no later than 2/13/04.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON CURRENT TECHNOLOGY
This is a request for information only. This is not a notice of RFP or RFQ issuance.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from commercial enterprises which currently provide automated emergency notification systems. This information is designed to give the U.S. House of Representatives knowledge of commercially available technologies and to assist in the development of requirements and terms of any subsequent, competitive solicitation. Respondents of interest to the House may be invited to demonstrate their system.

The House has an automated emergency notification system which can be defined as a scenario-based automated communication system capable of notifying individuals/groups of individuals simultaneously across 144 ports established over 8 T1 circuits. Activation of the system can be done locally or remotely. At present, the primary system includes, but is not necessarily limited to:  
•	One workstation (keyboard, monitor, mouse, printer) with switch-able access to two servers running Dialogic Communicator software on a Windows 2000 (server) platform with MS Access database. 
•	144 ports capable of simultaneous outgoing and/or incoming service.
•	Full size rack outfitted to house all equipment
•	4 independent modems (two assigned to each server)

The House is considering the procurement of equipment, software, support and maintenance to establish a redundant system at an alternate location as a back-up to the current system (a Dialogic Communicator). The scope of work would encompass the following:

(1)	Installation and implementation of equipment and software required to provide, at minimum, identical functionality of the primary emergency notification system. 
(2)	Development of software/process for downloading all current database/scenario/notification information from Dialogic Communicator.
(3)	Support, maintenance and training. 

This notice is initiated to compile a list of companies that can provide assistance to HIR in the development of a redundant backup for an automated emergency notification system. Respondents are asked to address feasibility of this endeavor and potential compatibility issues with primary system. Please provide: overview of service applications/configuration, engineering approach and pricing estimate (per port). Price is intended for ROM budgetary purposes only and firm quotes are not required. Respondents are also asked to provide references of where systems are installed. Interested parties are required to submit written responses in Microsoft Word format and as an attachment to an email only, no later than February 16, 2004.  The response should include the company name, address, telephone number, fax number, point of contact, email addresses, and company website, if available. Email your responses to jim.caskey@mail.house.gov and reference this RFI number and title. Direct technical questions to Mr. Tim Wright via email at tim.wright@mail.house.gov. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  These email addresses are provided for responses to this RFI only and are expressly not intended to be added to general solicitation lists, i.e., consider this an “opt-out” notice.

<DESC>SUBJECT: 13-MARINE LOCATION MARKER, MK 58 SERIES. The purpose of this sources sought is to identify alternative technologies for the red phosphorus candles used in the MK 58 Marine Location Marker mod 1, NSN 1370-01-074-0591, DODIC L580. The Coast Gu ard and the Navy use the MK 58 mod 1.  The marker is launched from aircraft in either day or night to mark the course of enemy submarines in antisubmarine warfare operations.  Markers may be used launched from high-speed aircraft or helicopters.  They can be used for any type of air to sea surface marking that are referenced by smoke and flame.  A marker consists of an aluminum body, approximately 21.78 inches in length and 5.03 inches in diameter, weighing approximately 11.5 lbs.  The center of gravity sho uld be 7.93 inches from the base end of the marker.  It is activated upon entry into the seawater and produces yellow flame and white smoke for a minimum of 40 minutes and maximum of 60 minutes.  Past and current production configuration utilizes red phosp horus (RP) candle to produce the yellow flame and white smoke.  The Navy is the design agency for this marker and is looking for alternative approaches to replace the RP candle. A performance specification technical data package is available. Companies int erested in proposing an alternative approach to the RP candles can contact HQ JMC, ATTN SFSJM-CDC/Mark Dorr, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, IL 61299-6000.  Request companies respond no later than 27 February 2004 and identify Marine Location Marker RP Alternative Sources Sought as the subject of your response. You can send questions to Mark Dorr, email:dorrm@osc.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Ground Truth Test Data
<DESC>DARPA intends to enter into a sole source contract with Geo-Centers of Pine, CO, to support a recurring Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) requirement under the Low Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) program.  Specifically, the requirement calls for the collection and processing of ground truth test data which will be conducted during the Summer 2004. The effort is a continuation of research and development previously performed by Geo-Centers, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable schedule delays. Furthermore, the contractor under this effort must be currently trained and qualified on the existing ground truth data collection system, sensors and custom algorithms previously delivered to DARPA/SPO, and currently stored at the Geo-Centers establishment in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The research is deemed to be available only from Geo-Centers.  This Notice is intended for informational purposes only; it is not a Request for Proposals. However, interested parties should contact Geo-Centers for subcontracting opportunities.

You may also submit supplemental hardcopy materials such as brochures, training materials, etc. to Vicki Walker at: Capital District Contracting Center 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101 Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5134 Statement of Objective Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) Training Background:  DAU has a requirement to deploy Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) training  to both the DAWIA and non-DAWIA workforce.  The value of training is in timely application.  There are dozens of courses available covering PBSA; however, few carry through with taking an organizations basic requirement that is to be executed and eventual ly placed on contract by the organization, and transform that basic requirement into an executable performance-based requirement. Requirement:  DAUs approach to PBSA training is to conduct a PBSA training workshop.  In the workshop, members of an organizationÃ¢Â€Â™s contracting and functional staffs will train together.  During the workshop, a current or planned requirement from the organization will be developed into a performance-based requirements document that achieves the performance outcomes contained in outcome 2 below.  It is recommended that the organizationsÃ¢Â€Â™ requirements be ones in the current acquisition planning cycl e and to be placed on contract in the near future.  DAU will review and validate course content and approach, and place selected vendors on a DAU-approved list from which agencies can directly order and schedule course offerings.   DAU faculty will audit c ourse offerings at no cost.  All documents developed in outcome 2 below will be posted in the applicable DAU PBSA Community of Practice (exclusive of any contractor-developed training materials). Performance Outcomes of the Workshop: 1. Enhanced understanding of PBSA, both in theory and application. 2. Facilitated learning through application to develop the following executable documents: a. Performance-based requirement, either as a performance work statement or statement of objectives. b. Performance assessment metrics and methodology. c. Acquisition approach to include type of contract, incentive arrangement, and source selection evaluation criteria. 3.Distribute student critiques and arrange for their submission, using a designated workshop representative, to the DAU-CLO office at the conclusion of the workshop. The potential demand for this type of workshop will exceed DAUs capacity to deliver it from organic resources.  We are requesting vendor proposals to determine: (i) their approaches to achieve the required performance outcomes listed above; (ii) number of hours and days needed for conducting the workshop; (iii) workshop cost; and (iv) the qualifications of their proposed trainers. Multiple awards are anticipated.  The offerors that qualify for award will be grouped as qualifying for one or more PBSA categories.  These categories are:  (1) Maintenance, overhaul, repair, servicing, rehabilitation, salvage, modernization, or modification of supplies, systems (including weapon systems), or equipment (2) Facilities maintenance and management (3) Operation of government-owned equipment facilities and systems (to include information technology and communications) (4) Transportation and related services  Performance assessment will be based on student critiques and feedback.  Vendors approved for offering this workshop will be listed on an approved vendor list, along with their cost for the workshop and the ratings they have received from past workshop cus tomers (on a five-point scale).  It is the vendors responsibility to: (i) develop all course materials, and (ii) provide subject matter experts and the facilitation necessary to successfully achieve the performance outcomes.

<DESC>THIS IS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. *****This solicitation, W914NS-04-Q-0134, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13 and DFARS Change Notice 20020531.  The associated NAICS code is 423860.*****The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Baghdad, Iraq has a requirement for ten (10) RHIB boats (Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat) with five (5) to be delivered NLT 2 Apr 04 and the remaining five (5) to be delivered NLT 1 Sep 04 to Umm Qasr Naval Base, Iraq.  The Key User Requirements are:
a.)  to operate safely offshore, on major rivers and estuarine waters up to and including sea state 4. b.)  to be operated by a crew of 2. c.)  to carry up to 6 passengers, each with 20 Kg of equipment.  d.) To provide a stable platform from which to conduct boarding operations.  It is envisaged that a boat length of 22 ft is the minimum required.  e.)  To have main propulsion system redundancy.  f.) to be capable of 35 knots (26 knots fully laden in calm conditions) g.) to have an endurance of 8 hours (patrol speed) or 3 hours (max speed).  Range of 100nm.  h.) to be supplied with a road-transportable trailer. i.) to be inter-operable with Coalition Forces (CF) and other Iraqi agencies. 
The ability to exhibit presence and effectively patrol Iraq’s territorial and estuarine waters and inland waterways is seen as a fundamental requirement needed to counter illegal activities which threaten the stability and security of a strategically vital region of Iraq. The standing up of an effective indigenous force capable of asserting itself on Iraq’s territorial and estuarine waters is therefore necessary.  The ICDF maritime capability is being developed by CMATT (Coalition Military Assistance Training Team.)  To provide the boarding capability required, it has been determined that there is a requirement for a medium sized RHIB powered by an out-board motor (OBM.)  OBMs are the preferred type of propulsion because they are more suited to the local environmental conditions and are considered more practical to maintain in the existing maintenance infrastructure.  Specifically, inboard engines are particularly susceptible to fuel contamination problems caused by micro-bacterial contamination (cladisporium resinae) which is prevalent in hot, humid conditions.  OBMs may also be removed from the boats for maintenance in a protected and climatically controlled environment ashore.  Particularly in view of the requirement to operate in offshore waters, a twin engine configuration is required to provide an appropriate level of propulsion system redundancy.	To develop the initial operating capability, it is calculated that 10 fast support craft will be required.  This will support the CMATT supervised training program and meet the force level needed to conduct the mission tasks throughout the AO.  The key tasks and priorities identified are as follows:	Primary Tasks:  Provision of credible presence in the ICDF AO.  Interdiction operations against vessels and personnel engaged in illegal activity.  Board and search operations against suspect vessels.  Protection of key Iraqi maritime facilities, including ports and offshore installations.  Operations with Coalition Forces.    Secondary Tasks:  Movement of ICDF personnel between locations across the AO.  Provision of support to civil authorities. 	Development of interoperability with Iraqi civil organizations in pursuit of regional security.	Development of interoperability for Joint and Combined Operations.
REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATIONS:  Ten craft will be required to meet the scope of the ICDF tasks.  The boats will require a range of 100 nautical miles, a top speed of 35 knots, an endurance of 8 hours at patrol speed and 3 hours at maximum speed.  The craft should be capable of carrying up to 8 people, each carrying 20 kilos of equipment.  Boarding operations will be carried out against a wide variety of vessels including; fishing vessels, dhows, oil barges and general cargo vessels in conditions up to Sea State 4.
A training program will commence mid Mar 04, with an operational capability in place by Oct 04.  A lack of ICDF capability to conduct effective maritime operations will ultimately impact upon the security of the region and in particular upon the operation of the only port facility in Iraq. 
SUMMARY:  The ICDF will need to operate boats capable of conducting boarding and search operations in Iraqi waters.  This capability will form a highly visible element of Iraq’s own security arrangements which are an essential part of the overall Security Sector Reform process.  The boats need to be delivered in time for specialist training to commence in mid Mar 04 (first 5 vessels) with the remaining 5 needed no later than 1 Sep 04.  These boats must be sufficiently robust to operate in the local conditions and should provide a long term and sustainable capability.  CMATT will oversee the introduction of these boats and provide the necessary training to Iraqi personnel to ensure that the maximum effect is achieved.
