<p>In support of its education mission, DoDEA-E operates transportation services for students attending DoD schools in eight host nations. DoDEA-E does not own vehicles used for student transportation, nor does it employ drivers or adult safety or security attendants. Student transportation is obtained by contracts with host nation commercial bus transportation companies. The inherent vulnerabilities of student transportation regarding the threat of terrorist and criminal exploitation make it imperative that DoDEA-E operate an active student transportation security services program that is (a) tailored to identification and assessment, containment and reduction of the risk to student security during daily transportation to and from school and home; and (b) that puts in place structure and procedures to respond to and manage en-route security emergencies when they occur.</p>

<p>Vendors who replied to the HE1254-18-R-STSSP, Request for Information (RFI) Source Sought, posting/ or e-mail, and submitted a Capability Statement, will be provided a copy of the Solicitation Restricted Access Request.<br />This acquisition will be conducted using Full and Open Competition Procedures.

<CONTACT>Michael Eagan, Contracting Officer, Phone 2565446679, Email michael.c.eagan@nasa.gov - Jennifer B. McCaghren, Contracting Officer, Phone (256) 961-7454, Email jennifer.b.mccaghren@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the continued Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) and low-rate initial production of the Space Launch System (SLS) Stages element, which is being developed under the SLS Stages contract, NNM07AB03C with The Boeing Company (Boeing).<br />&nbsp;
<p>SLS is the launch vehicle designed to send people and hardware to low earth orbit and beyond. The vehicle is an element of the overall Exploration Systems Development (ESD) architecture that includes launch vehicles, spacecraft, mission systems and ground systems needed to embark on a robust human solar system exploration program. The current stages contract includes the Core Stage (CS) and the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) and is a significant portion of the propulsion platform that provides power to the SLS.</p>
<p>The acquisition contemplated to fulfill the Government's requirements for finalizing DDT&amp;E and transitioning to low-rate initial production is the Stages Production and Evolution Contract (SPEC). SPEC will support the ESD architecture through the production and evolution of the Stages launch system for Exploration Missions (EMs) potentially through 2031; including sustaining engineering, ground and flight operations support, and the development of block upgrades which will represent new capabilities and functions required in addition to the base vehicle design. Some of these block upgrades may have a notable impact on the vehicle design.</p>
<p>SPEC is for the DDT&amp;E and production of the SLS Stages launch system to support the Agency's exploration launch date requirement of EM-3 in 2023, with a subsequent launch rate of one launch per year through 2031. Given currently available performance data on the Stages DDT&amp;E contract, the lead-time for the production of the CS and EUS is 48 months. Ultimately, SPEC will allow the Government to procure the Stages launch system for up to 10 additional missions, Flights 3-12, cover Flights 1 and 2, and address any potential acceleration in launch rate that may occur during the period of performance.</p>
<p>NASA/MSFC intends to procure the above requirements on a sole-source basis from Boeing under the authority of 10 U.S.C &sect; 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Suppliers or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" should no other respondents be capable of effectively producing one or both stages. Boeing is the incumbent contractor under the current Stages contract and is responsible for the DDT&amp;E and production of the highly specialized Stages launch system to meet mission requirements through EM-2. Boeing has developed critical knowledge, capabilities, and essential infrastructure during performance of the current DDT&amp;E contract, which uniquely qualifies them to support the production and operations of Stages under SPEC. These qualifications position Boeing to support an effective, timely, and safe transition to SPEC without substantial duplication of cost and schedule delays that would result from awarding SPEC to a new contractor. In addition, Boeing is uniquely qualified as the incumbent to ensure knowledge gained in performance of the current contract is transitioned to SPEC, including stabilization of the production process, incorporation of block upgrades, and the reduction of costs through learning curves as the program transitions to low rate initial production. Ultimately, this sole source contract will progressively reduce the risk associated with performance and support a future contract for full-rate production and operations.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 336414, "Guided Missiles and Space Vehicle Manufacturing," and has a size standard of 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a written capability statement which shall be considered by the Agency. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort via email to michael.c.eagan@nasa.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. CST on March 27, 2018. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Room 1E646, Rockville, MD 20850-9700.
<p>Note: This synopsis follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on March 8, 2017 under HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-PCPSB-75006-45. THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), NCI, has a long-standing pharmaceutical agent development program administered through the Chemopreventive Agent Development and Research Group (CADRG) as a Repository services unit. The object of the Repository program is to establish a centralized source of agents for use in studies by the DCP and to support the translation of promising laboratory discoveries into effective interventions for the prevention or reduction of cancer. The Repository services are integral to most of the scientific and clinical work undertaken by the Division.</p>
<p>This procurement is to continue a well-established Repository program within the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The successful Contractor shall maintain a centralized source of agents and development services necessary to support chemoprevention studies for effective medical interventions in the prevention or reduction of cancer. The repository provides important logistic organization for the acquisition, tracking, storage, maintenance, testing, quality control, and distribution of investigational agents.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, all work shall be in conformance with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) established current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/cder/ucm095412.htm), and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) standards (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=58 ). If there are subcontracted activities needed during the development of an investigational agent, the Contractor shall audit, implement, coordinate and monitor the flow of subcontracted work so that it proceeds in the most efficient and timely manner possible.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201100046C held by MRIGlobal.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />The purpose of the acquisition is to provide services to support many different agent development functions critical to chemoprevention research. These functions are generally described as sourcing, acquiring, documenting, storing, quality testing, custom manufacturing, packaging and labeling, distributing and tracking both pre-clinical investigational agents for basic research and clinical supplies for human clinical trials.</p>
<p>1) The Core Competencies required include cost estimation, agent receiving, specification setting, analytical testing, material acceptance and release, packaging and labeling, stability testing, proper environmental storage, shipping domestically and abroad, inventory tracking of clinical trial materials, agent returns and destruction or disposal of investigational agents and clinical study supplies. All information to support regulatory filings to health authorities, scientific reports for research documentation and manuscript publication will be maintained by the contractor and provided to DCP, when requested.<br />If the contract requires specialty services for the timely development of agents identified through DCP programs (e.g., the DCP RAPID program), a well-organized and effective subcontracting administrative unit may be needed if the Offeror is unable to self-perform the required work.</p>
<p>2) An offeror's facility must have sufficient space for: storage of pre-clinical agents (estimated at 5,000 sq. ft. of useable space); storage of clinical study supplies (estimated at 5,000 sq. ft. of useable space); a staging/quarantine area; separate shipping and receiving rooms; and, space devoted to an analytical chemistry unit (estimated at 5,000 sq. ft.) with a detached weighing area. The space must include areas for refrigerated and other environmentally-controlled storage conditions (e.g., light protection, humidity controlled cabinets - approximately 500 sq. ft.).</p>
<p>3) A comprehensive and continuously updated computerized logistics management system containing inventory movements, quantities on hand, expiration or re-test information, Certificates of Analysis and analytical testing results, on all materials, must be made available electronically to the National Cancer Institute Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) on demand through a secure, password-protected, DCP-dedicated server.</p>
<p>4) The successful Awardee shall be required to demonstrate experience and competency in domestic and international shipping of pharmaceuticals, especially through U.S. and foreign Customs, the FDA, and other Health Authorities in accordance with applicable regulations. The successful Awardee must have experience in obtaining a Quality Persons Determination for agents shipped into the European Union.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement will be for non-R&amp;D support services which will include severable and non-severable services. The severable services will include inventory management which includes receipt, processing, and distribution of research materials and agents. The non-severable services will include manufacturing vaccines not commercially available for use in pre-clinical and clinical trials.</p>
<p>This acquisition shall be acquired through full and open competitive procedures, and will be processed under FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) and the business size standard is $15,000,000.</p>
<p>The NCI anticipates awarding a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to the Offeror capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the Base Statement of Work (SOW.). Only one (1) award will be made as a result of the Solicitation with a 60 months base period of performance beginning on July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />The place of performance will be the Contractor's work site.</p>
<p>Set Aside Status:<br />None.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Notice of Intent<br /><br /></strong></span></div>
NAICS Code: 541620 Environmental Consulting Services. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-12-001, as described below.<br /><br />The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has a requirement in the Support for the Metals, Minerals and Energy Sector. This requirement is currently performed under Contract EP-D-12-001.<br /><br />Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) outlines the statutory requirements for the EPA's stationary source air toxics program. Within Section 112 there are several different programs for which the Sector Policies and Programs Division (SPPD) is responsible. Until recently, the SPPD's primary focus has been the development of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards under Section 112(d). When developing these standards, the EPA bases the regulatory requirement on technologies which are available and in use. Thus, most of the stationary source air toxics program has been "technology-based" to date. The SPPD has completed the last set of MACT standards under Section 112(d). However, there is existing and anticipated litigation on some of these standards that must be resolved and may require further technical analysis. With the finalization of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy (UATS) in July of 1999, the EPA introduced and outlined its "risk-based air toxics program," which includes both regulatory and non-regulatory programs and actions, support for studies, standards, development, and/or guidance preparation that focus on the metals, minerals, and energy sector. The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs. The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for major and area sources, residual risk standards and other standards development activities. Development of the standards considers available technologies and costs associated with implementing emission control requirements. Anticipated activities include, but are not limited to, identification of emission control equipment, cost of air pollution controls, assistance in developing the regulatory package, summarizing the public comments, analysis to support the response to comments document, assistance with executive order requirements (e.g., Paperwork Reduction Act), and review of the regulatory text.<br /><br />The incumbent Contractor provides support for studies, source pollutant standards development, and/or guidance preparation that focus on the metals, minerals, and energy sector, the development of standards that regulate the emissions of air toxics from stationary sources, the emissions of air toxics from stationary sources, and stationary source criteria pollutant standards which may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) or a standard based on "Best Available Controls (BAC) and guidance document activities.<br /><br />The current contract, EP-D-12-001, period of performance was extended for six months from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017 via Far Clause 52.217-8-Option to Extend Services. The current contract was then extended for an additional eight months from June 30, 2017 to February 28, 2018 via FAR Clause 6.302-2-Unusual and Compelling Urgency. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award a follow on contract for a one-year base period and two one-year option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulation<br />(FAR). However, due to delays in the acquisition process, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the current expiration date of February 28, 2018 of contract EP-D-12-001. Since the services of the contract are critical and cannot lapse, the EPA must extend the period of performance of the current contract for an additional six months to allow time for the new follow on contract to be awarded. The EPA intends to negotiate this period of performance extension on a sole source basis.<br /><br />There are no other contractors that have the capability of providing the level, breath, depth of support, and continuity of services that are required by OAQPS for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.<br /><br />This notice will be posted for 5 calendar days.<br /><br />The intent of this notice alerts the vendor community to the extension of contract EP-D-12-001, and the upcoming opportunity for competition of this opportunity. This notification alerts all vendors to this action and to determine if any other source (s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. Responses to this notice should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Jeffery Clodfelter via the following e-mail address (Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov) within 5 calendar days from the date of this notice.<br />

<DESC>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government desires to procure technical and analytical services in support of the Department of the Army's Military Construction Programs as described in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement supporting a small business program, provided 2 or more qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside. Be advised the Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if 2 or more small businesses do not respond with information to support the set aside. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Women-Owned Small Business concerns) to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price.
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government-wide Point of Entry Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) or General Services Administration (GSA). It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor FBO and GSA for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, with a size standard of $15M. This requirement under consideration is being looked at as a five (5) year effort, which would include a one year base period and four (4) one year options.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM) is the lead proponent for executing day-to-day military construction Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) responsibilities. OACSIM is the appropriation sponsor for Military Construction, Army (MCA) and Non-Appropriated Funded Construction (NAFC) projects. Military construction is governed by public law and each project must be specifically authorized and funded in MILCON legislation or performed under special statutory authority. The MILCON Program involves a sequence of reviews by the Office of the Secretary of the Army, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of Management, and Budget, and the Congress. The MILCON Integrated Programming Team (IPT) is the principal forum responsible for providing Army leadership with detailed analysis and strategic program recommendations for military construction needs, capabilities and priorities for the Active Army, Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve in order to support major Army initiatives within given fiscal constraints. Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands and Direct Reporting Units submit requirements to OACSIM in accordance with program guidance. Requirements are vetted through the MILCON IPT and result in development of a Future Year Defense Program that is approved by the Stationing Senior Review Group. Once approved, MCA Budget Justification Books for the Budget Estimate Submission (BES) and President's Budget (PB) are developed and coordinated. Justification Data is also compiled for the NAFC Program. Justification data is ultimately submitted to Congress and used to defend program requirements.</p>
<p>If a potential vendor believes they can provide services which meet or exceed the requirements identified in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement but under a different NAICS code, please feel free to respond to this Sources Sought document and identify the appropriate NAICS code and why you believe it is appropriate.</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3.

<p>5. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>

Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-2269, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>
<p>8. Any questions you might have about the Performance Work Statement which may help us further define the requirement. Please understand you will not receive a response to your individual question(s), but they may be addressed in future iterations of the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>9. Identify the appropriate GSA Government-wide Acquisition Contract/Schedule and your individual contract number that you believe this requirement would be a good fit for.<br />It is requested interested businesses submit (via e-mail) their completed response (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12-point font minimum) utilizing subject line reference W9124J-18-R-MILC to the following personnel: Ms. Mariapaz Ruiz, Contract Specialist, mariapaz.d.ruiz.civ@mail.mil, and Ms. Angelic M.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY NOR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS REQUEST. THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

The Department of Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office   NCO 2 is conducting a market survey in search of a responsible and verifiable Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business   SDVOSB   in order to determine the acquisition strategy for this potential procurement.

The anticipated requirement is for routine and emergency response asbestos abatement remediation services, inclusive of all labor, equipment, supplies as well as the transportation of all hazardous materials    asbestos, lead-based paint and/or mold    waste generated by the abatement to a suitable disposal facility.  Contractors would be expected to ensure that all work meets or exceeds all applicable Local, State and Federal laws and codes for abatement activities.  A five-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity   IDIQ   contract is anticipated. Specific work requirements would be determined by individual task orders to be issued under this basic IDIQ contract. 

Projects may be assigned at any of the five facilities within the VA New York Harbor and New Jersey Healthcare System   NYHHS and NJHCS:

VA NYH HCS Brooklyn, 800 Poly Place, Brooklyn, NY 11209

<SOLNBR>140R1018R0003
<RESPDATE>031218
<CONTACT>William Blyth, Contracting Officer, Email wblyth@usbr.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought<br />Minidoka Switchyard Modernization Project<br /><strong><br />SYNOPSIS</strong><br />&nbsp;A. The location of work is the Minidoka Dam, approximately 12 miles Northeast of Rupert, Idaho, in Minidoka County.<br /><br />&nbsp;B. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is conducting market research for the Minidoka Switchyard Modernization Project. The Minidoka Dam switchyard is a main bus and transfer bus arrangement with seven bays serving four transmission lines, one belonging to BPA, one to Raft River Electric, and two belonging to Idaho Power. Two other bays serve the incoming Minidoka powerhouses, with the final bay serving as the main connection point between the main and transfer bus. Each bay is wired through two to three sets of disconnects, which provide plant personnel with flexibility to electrically isolate each bay for maintenance, while maintaining electrical reliability to the outgoing transmission lines.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;C. Principle Components of Work: In the 138 kV Minidoka Switchyard Reclamation is planning to replace 20 disconnect switches and 4 ground switches, 55 stand-off post insulators and 66 suspension insulators, and 3 main bus potential transformers. The replacements are due to the equipment being at the end of intended service life and observed carbon tracking.<br /><br />&nbsp;D. The order of magnitude for this project is estimated to be from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000.<br /><br />&nbsp;E. Reclamation and BPA have coordinated the outages necessary to perform the replacement for the least impact on the Transmission System. Below is the Minidoka Switchyard outage work construction window and list of principle components to be replaced:<br />&nbsp; a. Estimated duration: September 18th - November 16th of 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Phase I: September 18th - October 23rd of 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) With the west side of the switchyard completely de-energized, the Contractor will remove, install, and test 14 disconnect switches; 3 ground switches; 3 main bus potential transformers; 41 stand-off post insulators; 42 suspensions insulators associated with Bays 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Phase II: October 26th - November 16th of 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) With the east side of the switchyard completely de-energized, the Contractor will remove, install, and test 6 disconnect switches; 1 ground switches; 14 stand-off post insulators; 24 suspensions insulators associated with Bays 5 and 6.<br /><br />&nbsp;F. The outage periods during which work can occur are extremely limited and cannot be altered. The Contractor will be responsible for providing all necessary resources to complete tasks during the allotted outage window(s).<br /><br />&nbsp;G. The intent of this notice is to identify potential offerors for Minidoka Switchyard Modernization Project. Reclamation is seeking qualified, experienced firm capable of providing the labor, equipment, and materials necessary to accomplish the Principle Components of Work identified above and as identified within the project specifications and drawings (not included herein and must be requested). Interested offerors are invited to submit the following information:<br />&nbsp; 1. Statement of interest as a prime and/or subcontractor <br />&nbsp; 2.

Firm's capability to successfully manage complex requirements <br />&nbsp; 6. Recent projects similar in size and scope<br />&nbsp; 7. Answers to following Questionnaire:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Please explain any issues you see with the current work sequence that would be detrimental to the performance of the work in the scheduled outage work performance window.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Please explain what your company's staffing approach would be for completing the work within the established outage work performance window (i.e. necessary number of crews, crew size, hours per week, etc.).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Please explain any issues with the proposed equipment arrangements that may pose complications, delays, or constructability problems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Please explain if you have any recommendations that would increase the likelihood of successfully completing this work in the outline outage work performance window.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Please explain any part of the work that poses safety issues you feel cannot be adequately mitigated.<br /><br />&nbsp;H. Interested Contractors may request a copy of the current set of draft project specifications and drawings with an email to wblyth@usbr.gov. Requests must be accompanied with a completed Non-Disclosure Agreement form included herein.<br /><br />&nbsp;I. This market research is for informational purposes only. This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued, and shall not be construed as a RFP or IFB, or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

<p>DLA Troop Support is conducting market research on the above item to determine an acquisition strategy that will enhance our support of military customers worldwide as well as to determine what your industry will be capable of providing with respect to the required item. For this reason, DLA Troop Support would appreciate your firm sharing your expertise and insight into how this item can be most efficiently procured.</p>
<p>DLA Troop Support anticipates issuing a solicitation for the referenced item under an Indefinite Quantity Contract. The contract may be for a term of one year or may contain an option to extend the term of the contract. If an option provision were included in the solicitation, each option term would be one year. However, the total contract term will not exceed five years. The answer to the questions concerning pricing will be one of the factors that will help the Government to determine the term of the contract.</p>
<p>Please note that your firm must be able to supply all NSN's in order to be considered for this anticipated acquisition. Consider this all or nothing type procurement.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this inquiry, in no way, should be interpreted as a solicitation for offers. No information provided in response to this inquiry will be considered binding between the vendor and the Government. With these facts in mind, please review the item listed above and answers the questions on the attached pages. The answers you provide will remain confidential. Please return this survey to Samuel Clifton at samuel.clifton@dla.mil, by March 12, 2018 at 3:30 pm.</p>

<SUBJECT>Precision, Vibration Isolated, Cryogenic Positioning System
<SOLNBR>NB686100-18-01185
<RESPDATE>030118
<CONTACT>Marc R. Zurasky, Phone 3034973246, Email marc.zurasky@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Acquisition Management Division (AMD)<br />Sources Sought for Commercial Item Purchase(s)
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on vendors that can provide a precision, vibration isolated, cryogenic positioning system. Said system will be installed at the mixing chamber plate of an Oxford Triton cryogen-free dilution refrigerator. The system will be used to position the quantum dot under investigation to the focal spot of a high numerical aperture microscope objective that is also operating at the mixing plate temperature.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements: The contractor shall provide a precision, vibration isolated, cryogenic positioning system meeting the following technical specifications:<br /><br />&bull; The positioners must be validated for operation below 25 milliKelvin.<br />&bull; Minimum step size at 4K - &lt; 5 nanometers.<br />&bull; System range in x and y dimensions &gt; 8 mm<br />&bull; System range in z direction &gt; 3 mm<br />&bull; The system shall have an integrated vibration isolation platform operating inside the dilution refrigerator to isolate positioners from cryostat and ambient vibrations. <br />&bull; System range in z direction &gt; 3mm.<br />&bull; Positioners shall dissipate zero heat while not in motion.<br />&bull; The stage shall include encoders (optical or resistive) to measure the position of each positioner with resolution &lt; 1 micrometer.<br />&bull; The encoder power should be less than 100 microwatts when active, and should be able to be turned off for zero heat load on the cryostat.<br />&bull; Energy dissipated by moving the actuators shall be &lt; 0.1 mJ/step.<br />&bull; Total weight, including vibration isolation platform &lt; 4 kg.<br />&bull; Load capacity of stage &gt; 75 grams.<br />&bull; Size of total system (including vibration platform) shall fit on a circular base in customer cryostat with 140mm diameter.<br />&bull; Height of total system shall be &lt; 150 mm</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The system must have a method for reading the position of the stage, so that if a good QD is found, we may return to that position later. There are many pumps and actuated valves attached to the refrigerator whose vibrations are transmitted to the plate that our experiment is planned to be mounted to. Since positioning stability of &lt; 25 nm is required in our experiment, these vibrations must be sufficiently attenuated before reaching the sample stage. For this reason, a vibration isolation stage specifically designed to attenuate spurius vibrations in a dilution refrigerator must be include with the system.</p>
<p>WARRANTY INFORMATION: The contractor shall provide a one year warranty from the date of acceptance.</p>
<p>PLACE OF DELIVERY: NIST / Boulder 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado, 80305, No Later Than (NLT) ten (10) weeks after receipt of order (ARO).</p>
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available now. The purpose of this sources-sought is to identify organizations with the requisite qualifications to meet the requirements of the item(s) stated herein. After results of this market research are obtained, analyzed and compared with NIST's minimum requirement(s). NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract.</p>
<p>If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses. This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334516. The specific purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is to determine if there are small businesses, within the parameters identified above, that can provide the product(s) identified.</p>
<p>Interested organizations that believe they can meet the requirement(s) should submit electronic copies of their capability statement. Please limit responses to five (5) pages or less. Responses should include the following information:</p>
<p>a) Name and DUNS or CAGE Code of organization that will provide the requirement.<br />Spec sheets and/or examples of similar requirements previously provided.<br />b) Lead time in providing the requirement after receipt of order. <br />c) Relevant information that is not listed above which the Government may consider in developing its minimum requirements and finalizing market research.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information should be clearly marked. Only electronic statements will be accepted. All responses to this Sources Sought shall be submitted via email by the required Response Date to Marc Zurasky at Marc.Zurasky@nist.gov. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information or comments received from potential sources resulting from this Sources Sought. This is not a Request for Information. The Government will not provide a response to questions regarding this project as a part of this Sources Sought.</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Science Data Integration Group (SDIG) with the Pacific Marine environmental Laboratory (PMEL), on a sole source basis with Weathertop Consulting, a small business, in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), One Responsible Source. Using FAR Part 12 and 13.5 procedures, the Government intends to negotiate a contract for the continuation of operation and maintenance of a server for a total performance period of three years.
<p>The purpose of this service is to continue the operation and maintenance of a complex web application which began in 1993 with 35 man years of development and is the foundational data visualization service of many NOAA, Government and non-Government entities. NOAA plans to contract with Weathertop Consulting for this service, of which the principal programmer has been involved in the project for seventeen years.</p>
<p>The Science Data Integration Group (SDIG) with the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) applies innovative software concepts to develop software for scientific data integration tools. One of the in-house developed, and widely accepted tools developed by SDIG is the Live Access Server (LAS) application.</p>
<p>LAS is a unique web application for geo-science dataset analysis and visualization that has been developed by and is supported by SDIG at NOAA/PMEL (see http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/LAS/) that strives to blend these two approaches to environmental science. LAS provides users with a highly interactive interface through which they can visualize, subset, download and inter-compare scientific data sets (Schweitzer et al 2007 and Schweitzer et al 2008, Hankin et al 1998, Sirott et al 2001, Callahan et al 2004). On the order of 50 Live Access Server sites are in operation within NOAA, within other Federal Agencies and within academia and internationally. The LAS server is the foundation for several projects that the SDIG group is responsible for: the Observing System Monitoring Center (OSMC -- http://osmc.noaa.gov/Monitor/OSMC/OSMC.html), which supports the NOAA Office of Climate Observations (OCO); the NOAA/GFDL data portal (http://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov:8380/las/servlets/dataset); the Surface Ocean Carbon Atlas (SOCAT) server (http://socat.info/); and the Earth Systems Grid Federation (ESGF -- http://esgf.llnl.gov) in which SDIG is a collaborator with responsibility for Web-based visualization tools and for supporting participation in the federation by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA/OAR/GFDL). LAS will be an integral component for data selection, subsetting and visualization with the implementation PMEL Data Integration Strategy with an expected implementation period of 6 years.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to continue with the design cycle that has made LAS successful within the specialized community of ocean and climate scientists: to understand emerging ocean and climate data analysis requirements; to develop data models that address these requirements; to evaluate software requirements; develop an object-oriented architecture based on those requirements; create a design, including frameworks, data models, protocols, objects, integration with legacy code, and testability based on the architectural specifications; implement and debug the design; manage operating systems to accommodate application needs regarding network data access, network security and usage logging; design user interfaces and perform usability testing; and troubleshoot and correct interactions with legacy software.</p>
<p>The range of software disciplines will include object-oriented design, distributed computing, network programming, computer graphics, scientific graphics, user interface design, usability testing, database design, scientific data formats, client-server, multi-threaded, procedural programming and ocean/climate data modeling knowledge. The computer languages in which the work will be performed include both procedural and object-oriented languages: Python, HTML, JavaScript (and languages that compile-down to JavaScript like Dart), and Java. The operating system environments on which the work must be performed and deployed includes UNIX systems (Linux) and Windows systems. The contractor will be required to track the continually evolving standards for Java, HTML, XML, JSON, HTTP, GWT, and other World Wide Web protocols and adapt developments to adjust to these changes.</p>
<p>There exists no other company with the unique skills and expertise with respect to LAS - the system architecture&#894; the Web service interfaces&#894; the configuration framework&#894; the Serverside transformation capabilities&#894; the user interface design, the unique combination of scientific analysis and visualization functionality that this contract addresses in its Statement of Work, and the specific software environments in which the system has been built such as the PyFerret application, the Google Web Toolkit, and the Bootstrap framework.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may provide written notification to the Contract Specialist. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services and the small-business size standard is $27.5M of average annual receipts.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, erik.lundstrom@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered at sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), on a sole source basis with Inmarsat Solutions, Inc., in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), One Responsible Source. Using FAR Part 12 and 13.5, procedures, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with Immarsat Solutions, Inc. for Routerbased unrestricted digital internetworking connectivity solution (RUDICS), Short Burst Data (SBD), and voice service.
<p>This satellite service allows sending and receiving of data to ships, buoys, drifters, floats, and other oceanographic equipment. As new equipment gets deployed, PMEL must have new services activated and initiated within 2 days, this is done by activating and initiating SIM cards that are held on the NOAA campus. Requested activation/initiation information must be provided within 2 days of request. Deactivation must occur within 7 days of the request. Inmarsat Solutions Inc. is the vendor that currently provides this service. PMEL has over 400 active SIM cards with Inmarsat.</p>
<p>Currently no vendor is able to offer a transition to their service with a guarantee of an error free transition with minimal downtime (less than 4 hours). There is a concern that the data after a switch won't be able to properly port to the PMEL server. Additionally, switching the physical SIM cards requires NOAA ship time. Travel time to get to each SIM card location can be anywhere from 1 to 10 days depending on location and weather conditions. PMEL estimates that switching the SIM cards at scheduled service intervals would take seven years to complete. If a transition was to take place and there was any issue causing the new value added reseller (VAR) not to be able to activate any of the SIM cards for not-retrievable instruments, thousands of dollars in equipment could be lost and invaluable amount of data could be lost.</p>
<p>Engineering requirements:<br />Global 24x7 Coverage<br />Bi-directional communications<br />Baud rates &gt;=2400bps<br />Mobile Originated and Mobile Terminated Calls<br />RUDICS (Router-Based Unrestricted Digital Internetworking Connectivity Solutions)<br />Short-burst data (SBD)<br />Voice</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may provide written notification to the Contract Specialist. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

corrective actions will be dictated by the identification of microorganisms recovered (at least to the genus
level) by an appropriate credentialed laboratory of any microbial bioburden captured as a CFU using an
impaction air sampler. Highly pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., Gram-negative rods, coagulase positive
Staphylococcus, molds and yeasts) can be potentially fatal to patients receiving compounded sterile
preparations and must be immediately remedied, regardless of CFU count.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: <br /></strong><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong>
<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong><br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a photo-acoustics sensing based laser vibrometer. The technology is a sensor for remotely detecting sub part-per-billion (ppb) levels of ambient trace gases and chemical species. The system includes a high-repetition-rate, pulsed laser module that is spectrally tuned to a desired chemical species. The photons from the laser are absorbed by the target chemical, creating an acoustic vibration that impacts a diaphragm (which acts like a speaker). A highly sensitive, photo-emf detector is then used to measure the magnitude of the vibration, which corresponds to the concentration of the target chemical. The technology is being developed as a small handheld device, making it appealing for a variety of commercial uses such as: chemical detection, contactless cardiac monitoring, amongst many others. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/<br /><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.</strong></p>

<DESC>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to issue a sole source procurement for a LiDAR Mobile Surveying System from GEXCEL SRL under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services&nbsp; will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />
<div>NIST Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) currently has an active research program studying various aspects of location-based services. A high-precision LiDAR surveying system is needed to enable research related to indoor mapping, localization and tracking, and navigation. PSCR has initiated a collaboration with the European Research Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) who have developed an extremely powerful system and software that are used for a variety of applications, including as a reference measurement system for indoor localization competitions which is considered proprietary. The capabilities in this system are proprietary and have been developed specifically for research and monitoring applications requiring very precise, accurate data collection, as well as flexible software features. The JRC has licensed their system and software for purchase through a single vendor, GEXCEL, as the HERON AC-1. In order to continue this collaborative research with the JRC, PSCR recommends a sole source acquisition of the HERON AC-1 through GEXCEL.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Issue Date: 23 FEBUARY 2018 - Closing Date: 12 MARCH 2018 - 4:00 PM EST<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>I. Request for Information:</strong></p>
<p>The Government is issuing this RFI as part of a market survey in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to determine the availability of sources to provide Phoenix Integration ModelCenter Suite Software at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane, IN.</p>
<p>This RFI is published to obtain information for use by NSWC Crane Division, for market research and planning purposes only; and is not a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to current and near-term abilities. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is as follows: The purpose of this requirement is to procure Phoenix Integration ModelCenter suite software licenses and 8 hours of Application Engineer Advanced Support in support of GXT Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) efforts on Strategic Systems program Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) project at NSWC Crane. GXT requires the ability to link architecture models with analysis framework for the architected system to run trade studies, perform requirement verification, and to conduct trusted technical reviews. Once in the analysis framework, ModelCenter provides integration and execution of architecture, CAD, analytical, and simulation tools. ModelCenter will provide the interoperability and singular execution of these tools and the capability to customize a solution for toolsets beyond its out-of-the-box capability. GXT will also be able to open, review, and execute contractor created model integrations. Phoenix Integration is the Sole Source Supplier of the ModelCenter suite in the United States.</p>
<p>Information may be submitted by any government or non-government entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and any institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and /or engineering (universities), or by consortia compromising such concerns. The Crane Division encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUB zone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The Government may choose to visit, or host a visit from, any potential sources. This request for information/sources sought synopsis in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the Government for information provided.</p>
<p><strong>II. BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>Market Research conducted by the Requiring Technical Authority has identified the ModelCenter as the product that provides the connectivity required the for the architecture, CAD, analytical, and simulation tools currently being utilized and tools planned for GXT Model Based Systems Engineering. Market Research included internet searches for competing toolsets, integration between modeling tools, and for technical paper on model integration.</p>
<p>In addition, members of GXT have attended workshops and conferences by the National Defense Industry Association and the International Council for Systems Engineering to listen to success stories from industry on model integration. Lastly, the capabilities needed were discussed at the NSWC Crane Systems Engineering (SE) Community of Interest (COI). Members of the COI could not provide an alternative toolset to integrate the variety of engineering domain models required.</p>

<p>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Opportunity with the Department of Homeland Security for the Development of Molecular Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccines.</p>
<p>AGENCY: Science and Technology Directorate, DHS.</p>
<p>ACTION: Notice of intent.</p>
<p>SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T), through its Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), is seeking industry collaborators to aid DHS S&amp;T in developing foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) molecular vaccine technologies with the goal of producing commercially available FMD vaccines. DHS S&amp;T requests that vaccine manufacturers submit a white paper describing their capabilities and experience with various molecular vaccine platforms. Selected applicants will be required to enter into a Limited Purpose (LP)-CRADA that will define the conditions of the partnership, including intellectual property rights and licensing conditions associated with DHS S&amp;T technologies. Specifically, DHS S&amp;T is interested in the use of a FMD virus (FMDV) 3C protease mutant (see Journal of Virology, Foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C protease mutant: Implications for FMD vaccine development, (doi:10.1128/JVI.00924-17), shown by DHS to significantly enhance FMDV capsid expression compared to wildtype (wt) 3C. DHS S&amp;T has successfully evaluated and demonstrated feasibility of the 3C mutant in the following expression platforms: baculovirus, mammalian cell culture, and E. coli culture. Details will be disclosed to partners who are selected to participate.</p>
<p>The role of the industry collaborator(s) for this LP-CRADA collaboration will be to develop and evaluate the use of the 3C protease mutant in production of molecular FMD vaccine candidates in collaboration with DHS S&amp;T at PIADC. Upon successful completion, the commercial partner will submit an FMD vaccine product license application and product development plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) (see Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) section 102.6 and related USDA APHIS Veterinary Services memoranda). The FMD vaccine candidate(s) must also have the capability to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals using commercially available test kits. DHS S&amp;T is seeking collaborators who own or have access to the technological components for, have the technological expertise in, and have proven track records of success in the fields of transboundary animal disease vaccine research, development, and the attainment of USDA vaccine product licenses. LP-CRADA collaborators must indicate if they are currently or may be funded by the Federal government for any related efforts, and if yes, they must include a discussion of how proposed LP-CRADA work and Federal government-funded work would not be duplicative.</p>
<p>The proposed term of the LP-CRADA can be up to thirty-six (36) months.</p>
<p><br />ADDRESSES: Mail comments and requests to participate to Dr. John Neilan (ATTN: John Neilan, PIADC, P.O. Box 848, Greenport, NY 11944). Submit electronic comments and other data to John.Neilan@st.dhs.gov.</p>

When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the commercial buy as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. Contingent upon availability of funding, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the fully capable vendor FINMECCANICA S.PA that quotes the overall best value to the government. With exception of the Aircraft OEM, a capable vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Service Facility, and/or an OEM approved distributor facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the commercial buy, and be able to certify the accessories and parts are for the HC-27J. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their quote for capability determination or for registration in WWW.SAM.GOV . If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS item managers and engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Mr. Samual Vigo (252) 334-5268 for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
