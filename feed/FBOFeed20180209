<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees.
<p><br />AFRL/RITA requires a purchase of a Hydra Harp + SI100. The system is comprised of the following components:</p>
<p>&bull; Quantity of 1- Part Number 930021<br />o HydraHarp 400M - Mainframe<br />&#61607; USB 3.0 interface <br />&#61607; Picosecond event timer<br />&#61607; Sync module up to 150MHz<br />&#61607; TTTR Mode and DLL library for custom programming <br />&bull; Quantity of 4- Part number: 930015<br />o HydraHarp 400 - TDC Module<br />o Two channel TDC module, independent channels<br />o 1ps time resolution, 65535 time bins<br />o Variable delay settings for each channel<br />&bull; Quantity of 8- SI100, inverters</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>PicoQuant Photonics North America, Inc. - PQPI<br />9 Trinity Drive<br />West Springfield, MA 01089</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It is essential to have a system with a counting, time-tagging and correlation system for interfacing with a large array of photon counting detectors. The HydraHarp System (8-channel) counting model must reach the desired resolution (1ps) respectfully, include constant fraction discriminators and contain all the necessary elements to be used in conjunction with current applications and with the existing HydraHarp Systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PicoQuant Photonics North America, Inc. is the only company that can provide a mainframe that can be used with existing TDC modules and interface with the other <br />HydraHarp Mainframes already in the Governments possession.<br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Other manufactures are unable to meet the requirement without severely impacting or jeopardizing the success of ongoing research and result in substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition. </span></p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before&nbsp;16 March&nbsp;2018.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

<DESC><p><br />This is a synopsis for&nbsp;the repair of the C-5&nbsp;Ram Air Turbo pump (RAT) is used to provide pressure to the No. 2 hydraulic system for limited flight control use in the event of an in flight emergency such as a multiple engine failure. The RAT, which is located in the forward portion of the left main landing gear pod, consists of a pressure pump and a six-bladed turbine which drives a fixed displacement hydraulic pump. The RAT pump is critical to the emergency operation of the No. 2 hydraulic system, which controls all the flight controls on the C-5. Failure to repair and produce serviceable assets will cause grounding of C-5 aircraft.</p>

proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through

requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<RESPDATE>022418

<DESC><p>Pre-solicitation Notice</p>
<p>Title<br />Procurement and Late-Stage Development of Smallpox Antiviral Drug(s)</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Smallpox (Variola viridae or VARV, the etiological agent responsible for smallpox disease) is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people throughout history. An effort spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) led to the eradication of smallpox disease in the 1970s, with the last case of smallpox diagnosed in 1977. While smallpox disease is eradicated, repositories of VARV remain, it is still considered one of the most dangerous human pathogens as it is highly communicable and carries exceptionally high morbidity; the two known repositories are in the Russian Federation and the United States. Furthermore, recent advances in synthetic biology allow for the creation of smallpox viruses from published genomic sequences available to the public.</p>
<p>Medical countermeasures (MCM) against Smallpox are urgently needed should future outbreaks of Smallpox occur. The 2014 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan identifies Smallpox as a high-priority threat as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Vaccines are no longer administered to the US population (outside of military recruits and first responders) and there are no therapeutic agents available on the market to treat symptomatic smallpox. To counter the threat, the US Government stockpiles both a large quantity of smallpox vaccine intended for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and a limited quantity of antiviral therapeutics intended to treat symptomatic patients during the course of a smallpox event. The government has pursued this multi-faceted approach with the goal of being able to rapidly deploy lifesaving therapeutics to an effected population during a smallpox event and to provide sufficient vaccine to protect the population surrounding an effected area or those who are considered at risk of infection.</p>
<p>While there is a licensed vaccine for the pre-exposure prophylaxis against smallpox, there are currently no approved therapeutic antivirals for the treatment of symptomatic smallpox. BARDA is seeking to procure smallpox therapeutic antiviral agents for the Strategic National Stockpile that can be used in the event of an outbreak to treat symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>All proposals submitted to any future solicitations shall have evidence of two formulations of the antiviral (parenteral and nonparenteral), an active FDA IND or licensed product with completed phase I trials for both products, evidence of efficacy in at least two animal models accepted by the FDA for the evaluation of a smallpox medical countermeasure, and the ability of the Offeror to deliver at least one formulation to the SNS upon contract award (e.g. FDA approval, pre-EUA IND on file).</p>
<p><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice Objective</p>
<p>This Pre-solicitation Notice is issued pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.2. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This Pre-solicitation Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, AMCG is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an RFP may be available electronically through the FedBizOpps website in February 2018 for 45 days with proposals being due in April 2018. Once any RFP is posted we encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor this internet site (www.fbo.gov) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one contract award with both cost reimbursement and firm-fixed CLINs will be awarded by July 2018. The anticipated base period of performance for any resultant contract(s) will be for a total of 60 months and up to 10 years with options if exercised. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1)
requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is
for a proposed award of a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), base and four (4) option years, under the Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) to the following contractor for Fire Alarm System Maintenance Services in support of Iowa City VA Health Care System, 601 Highway 6 West, Iowa City, IA 52246-2209:

Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP
DUNS: 094738007
4700 Exchange Court, Suite 300
Boca Raton, FL 33431-4450

This is done under authority of 41 U.S.C. 152 (3) and 40 U.S.C. 501, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6
(a)(1)(i)(B): Only one source is capable of providing the supplies and services required at the level of
quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

This is not a request for competitive quotes.

Market research revealed that Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP is the proprietary developer and sole
service provider for the fire alarm system currently being utilized by Iowa City VA Health Care System.
Additionally, Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP is the creator and Original Equipment Manufacturer of
the fire alarm equipment (4100ES Networked Fire Alarm System) and has over the life of this equipment
serviced this equipment for Iowa City VA Health Care System. Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP,
furthermore, owns the proprietary maintenance rights for this equipment. Thus, it is impossible for any
other company to provide maintenance for this equipment as Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP has
sole rights and does not allow for authorized resellers, authorized dealers, or third party maintenance
vendors to provide such services. Any other entity besides Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP providing
this service would result in violation of these proprietary rights and voiding of any equipment warranties,
as applicable.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this service is 561621 (Security
Systems Services) and the Product Service Code (PSC) is H963 (Other Quality Control/Test/Inspect  
Alarm, Signal, and Security Detection Systems).

While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and
capability to satisfy the requirement, including documentation from the proprietary rights holder Johnson
Controls Fire Protection LP that such contractor could provide this service as an authorized reseller,
authorized dealer or third party.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement no later than 10:00am Central Standard Time (CST), 2-23-2018, which shall be considered by the agency by emailing such statement and supporting documentation to Doug Reed, Contracting Officer, at douglas.reed3@va.gov. No phone calls please. Please indicate  Response to FSS LSJ Fire Alarm System Maintenance  in subject line of e-mail.

Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the
procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon
responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government under authorities cited above.

<CONTACT>Benton, Alfred
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Caribbean-Florida Water Science Center (CFWSC) has a requirement to establish Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ) base year with four option year periods. The minimum requirements for the tags that's needed to provide satellite-location only, whereas we need others that provide satellite-location plus depth, and still others that provide GPS location, satellite-location, plus depth, and another model that is an accelerometer (i.e., acceleration data logging tags or ADLs). We anticipate that annually we will need a mix of 40-60 tags, depending on future funding and project goals. The need is project-based, and we have 2 current projects where we need both location and depth, but we need to have flexibility in the size of the tags because we may get juvenile turtles that cannot be tagged with the largest models of tags. We also need flexibility in programming the tags (i.e., we need to be able to program them once we have them in the field) because on these new projects, we do not yet know which species we may be capturing; we would program a tag differently for a green turtle versus a loggerhead versus a Kemp's ridley versus a hawksbill. As well, for any adult males captured, we may need to program the tags differently from how we would program them for adult females whom we know more about from decades of tracking studies around the globe. 

There are four option year periods.
Request for Proposal (RFP) 140G0118R0003 will be issued on or about 02/09/2018 with written proposals due on or about 03/06/2018. This acquisition is total small business set-a-side. The NAICS code is 334513. The size standard is $750 employees.
The anticipated award date of the contract is 03/16/2018. A vendor must be registered at
https://www.sam.gov/index.html to be awarded the contract.
All responsible sources may submit a bid or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Responses may be emailed to abenton@usgs.gov or mailed to the address specified in the solicitation.

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY

Ambulance/Wheelchair for Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, (Uptown and Downtown and outlying locations), Augusta GA 

This is a source sought announcement ONLY and is NOT a request for proposals or quotes. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposal or solicitation of offerors. This notice is to assist the VA in determining sources, reviewing commercial terms and conditions and ensuring a best value to the Government.  

The attached Statement of Work documents are draft format and utilized for market research purposes only and seeking possible contractors that can perform the requirement.

The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their business size classification (hubzone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, small veteran owned or service disabled veteran owned small business) relative to NAICS 621910 and 485991 (size standard is currently $15.0 Million). Requisition will be listed under NAICS 621910.

Hawk One: Unlike orbital, laser or rotational atherectomy, the HawkOne system, with its directional cutting design, offers the greatest versatility when treating PAD. Whether your atherectomy goal is to maximize luminal gain, create in-line flow, target eccentric or circumferential disease.
ONE DEVICE FOR ABOVE & BELOW THE KNEE 
Now available in 6F, the HawkOne  device is the newest addition to Medtronic s directional atherectomy portfolio, which restores blood flow by removing plaque from blocked arteries in the lower extremities.
The design enhancements of the HawkOne platform plus the new 6F size simplify device selection for physicians who treat above and below the knee.
TREAT ALL MORPHOLOGIES
The HawkOne  device allows physicians to treat all morphologies, including severe calcium.  The directional cutting design is consistent and predictable, with no increase in cut depth
 Device pushability and torqueability offers control through challenging lesions
TREAT WITH PROCEDURAL EFFICIENCY
 Cleaning time is faster with preloaded distal flush tool
 No capital equipment provides easy set up
Turbo Hawk: 
The TurboHawk  plaque excision system treats peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by removing plaque from blocked arteries. The TurboHawk device is available in a High Efficiency (HE) Cutter to tackle the toughest lesion morphologies, including calcium,* and a Smooth Cutter to treat mild to moderately calcified lesions. Now you can treat PAD with technology that maximizes lumen gain, preserves a patient s native vessels, and keeps future treatment options open.
Silver Hawk:
SilverHawk technology uses a tiny rotating blade that shaves and removes plaque from the vessel lumen, thereby enhancing luminal gain. By removing plaque, the SilverHawk device creates an open channel for adequate blood flow without stretching the vessel. No capital equipment is needed to operate the SilverHawk system so set-up time is minimal.
The SilverHawk Plaque Excision System from Covidien treats peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by removing plaque buildup in the arteries of the leg. SilverHawk technology incorporates use of a tiny rotating blade that shaves plaque from the vessel lumen, thereby enhancing luminal gain, and removes plaque from the body. Directional atherectomy with the SilverHawk device enables physicians to maximize lumen gain and minimize barotrauma without leaving any implant behind.

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract based on responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 with a size standard of $15.0 million is being considered.</p>
<p>NCI may issue a request for quotation (RFQ) as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />The objective of this requirement is to investigate common and differential changes in gene (mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA) profiles associated with fractionated and single dose radiation for the discovery of markers and druggable pathways in multiple human prostate cancer models. <br /><br />REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />TASK 1<br /><strong>Analyze in vivo experimental cell population data to identify signals for radiation injury classification.</strong><br /><br />This task seeks to understand differences in the cellular response to a bolus dose of radiation vs a fractionated dose by examining data from cells irradiated in vivo. In this task, the Contractor will use the sets of mRNA and lncRNA data to identify relevant signals for classification between three radiation-injury responses: 0Gy, 10Gy, and 10x1Gy doses. For both mRNA and lncRNA, the Contractor will look at the in vivo experimental data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. These methods could include elastic net regression, random decision forests, support vector machines, and fused support vector machines.<br />&nbsp;<br />TASK 2<br /><strong>Merge in vivo, in vitro, long term in vitro, and in vitro 3d model datasets to identify signals across all three experimental conditions relevant to radiation injury classification.</strong><br /><br />This task seeks to understand differences in the cellular response to a bolus dose of radiation vs a fractionated dose by examining data from all datasets available. In this analysis, the Contractor will merge the in vivo, in vitro, long term in vitro and in vitro 3d model data to create one comprehensive dataset, for both the mRNA and lncRNA datasets. The Contractor will look at the combined experimental data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice, then will run a qualitative analysis of the identified signals to determine if the signals are relevant to study radiation injury in humans. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. Performance of these models will be compared to the in vivo model results from Option 1 to determine if additional experimental data adds information to the classification of radiation injury. By using the performance in a similar classifying scheme between radiation doses as a point of comparison, the Contractor will highlight the common signals that are potentially found using different experimental methods to support future research into these signals as biomarkers of disease.<br /><br />TASK 3<br /><strong>Analyze in vitro and in vitro 3d model experimental cell population data to identify signals for radiation injury classification.</strong><br /><br />This task seeks to characterize similarities and differences between the response to radiation of cells cultured in conventional vs. 3-D in vitro cell culture methods. Similar to Option 1, the Contractor will use the sets of mRNA and lncRNA data to identify relevant signals for classification between three radiation-injury responses: 0Gy, 10Gy, and 10x1Gy doses. For both mRNA and lncRNA, the Contractor will examine the in vitro and in vitro 3d model experimental data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. These methods could include elastic net regression, random decision forests, support vector machines, and fused support vector machines. <br /><br />TASK 4<br /><strong>Analyze in vitro and long term in vitro experimental cell population data to identify signals for radiation injury classification.</strong><br /><br />This task seeks to understand similarities and differences in the response to radiation between cells cultured for a short term and long term in vitro. Similar to Option 1, we will use the sets of mRNA and lncRNA data to identify relevant signals for classification between three radiation-injury responses: 0Gy, 10Gy, and 10x1Gy doses. For both mRNA and lncRNA, we will examine the in vitro and long term in vitro data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. These methods could include elastic net regression, random decision forests, support vector machines, and fused support vector machines. <br /><br />DELIVERY POINT:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center, Medium Endurance Cutter Product Line, has a requirement for the purchase of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Escher-Wyss, Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP) Hubs, miscellaneous spare parts for hub overhaul, and the overhaul of hubs.
<p><br />These supplies and services are required for the CPP hubs on U.S. Coast Guard 270' WMEC "A &amp; B" class cutters. The Coast Guard does not possess the proprietary technical specifications, drawings, manufacturing/provisioning data, or special tools necessary to provide these supplies or training. This information was not purchased at the time of the original acquisition and is proprietary to the OEM, Andritz Hydro. It is the Government's belief that only NW Propeller Operations, in Lakewood, Washington, has the capability to provide the supplies and services due to the fact that they are the only U.S. based authorized parts distributor and have primary access to the proprietary information required to complete OEM overhauls.</p>
<p>However, potential sources can submit information demonstrating their capabilities to provide genuine OEM supplies, have access to OEM technical information required to complete OEM overhauls.</p>
<p>This information shall include, but is not limited to: (1) Data that<br />the required support and supplies have been satisfactorily provided to the OEM or the Government in the past; AND (2) a written letter, signed by the OEM, which verifies the interested party's authority to supply OEM support manufactured items and parts to the Government and provide the necessary technical information to complete overhauls. The Government does not intend to pay for any information that is submitted in response to this synopsis.</p>
<p><br />The above information must be received no later than ten (10) calendar days from the date this notice is published.&nbsp; Information received after this period may not be considered.</p>

SCOPE: 

The scope of this effort falls in line with VA s mission, goals, and objectives in support of providing Veterans  care. Automated Medication Dispensing Systems is a computerized drug storage device or cabinet designed for hospitals. It allows medications to be stored and dispensed near the point of care while controlling and tracking drug distribution. They are also called unit-based cabinets (UBCs), automated dispensing devices (ADDs), automated distribution cabinets or automated dispensing machines (ADMs). Because automated dispensing systems track user access and dispensed medications, their use can improve control over medication inventory. The real-time inventory reports generated by many cabinets can simplify the fill process and help pharmacy track expired drugs. Furthermore, by restricting individual drugs   such as high-risk medications and controlled substances   to unique drawers within the cabinet, overall inventory management, patient safety, and medication security can be improved.

This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the offeror indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product. For each equal product, the offeror must include a description reflecting the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the equal product(s) specified in the solicitation. The offeror also must clearly identify the item by brand name (if any) and make/model number. Finally, the offeror must include descriptive literature, such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the contracting officer, and clearly describe any modifications it plans to make to a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.
 
See attachment for Contract Line Item Numbers along with Salient Characteristics, P/N and description which will be in the proposed solicitation. 

DISCLAIMERS: 

The VA will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to: 

1) Provide the commodity consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 
2) Secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 
3) Implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with delivery schedules; and meeting the rigid listed specifications.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) <br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) <br />Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong><br />This announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) by the United States Air Force, Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Offutt AFB, NE. AFLCMC/HBCK intends to execute a one-year extension (through 29 April 2020) on the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) contract (FA8730-14-D-0011) with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Northrop Grumman Information Systems, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This NOCA shall not be considered by your organization as an invitation to bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. Issuance of this NOCA does not restrict the Government regarding an acquisition approach.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong><br />The GAP CIE contract is a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract, awarded to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation on 1 May 2014. Individual delivery orders may be awarded under the IDIQ through 30 April 2019, and the contract ceiling for the basic contract is $98M. The basic contract includes FAR Clause 52.216-22 which allows performance on individual orders through 29 Apr 2020. This contract action will align the current GAP CIE ordering period to coincide with the current GAP CIE performance period. The current contract value is $30.8M, and the basic contract ceiling will not be increased as a result of this extension. The GAP CIE contract provides software sustainment and maintenance deliveries to the GAP CIE software application code base, and is one of several contracts that fall within the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) program portfolio.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension Requirement(s)<br /></span></strong>Under the present contract, the Government has focused sustainment efforts on re-architecting the GAP CIE system to address significant cybersecurity challenges due to a combination of planned and unexpected events. This re-architecture is technically complex and must be accomplished without loss of critical operational capabilities. Upcoming sustainment efforts include but are not limited to, infrastructure upgrades, authentication subsystem re-architecture and coalition releasability. These efforts have been planned and budgeted, and will commence prior to the end of the current ordering period, but will not be finished until the end of the performance period. Extending the ordering period to coincide with the performance period reduces the Government's risk in addressing unknown requirements that need to be satisfied prior to the end of the performance period without maintaining code baselines from multiple software developers. The technical code base, as currently designed, is not conducive to a multiple developer approach and integration risks and cost associated with multiple developers is not in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></strong><br />If your company can meet the continuation of all GAP CIE contract requirements by 1 March 2018, please provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer at lee.e.smales.civ@mail.mil no later than 12:00pm CST on 1 March 2018. Responses are limited to five (5) pages in a Microsoft Word or PDF compatible format. To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure. The Government reserves the right to contact the submitting parties for further clarifications. Any response submitted for this NOCA constitutes consent for that submission to be reviewed by military personnel, Government civilians, and associated support contractors including Strategic Professional Resources, Inc. and the MITRE Corporation. Respondents are advised the Government is under no obligation to provide feedback with respect to any information submitted. All submissions become the property of the Government and will not be returned. All information received from responsible sources by the above date will be considered, however the determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this notice nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to AFLCM/HBCK.</p>

This transition of contract vehicles took advantage of SOF experience and expertise within PdM STS and reduced cost due to the lower overhead of the SOF RAPTOR III contract. However, the cost of supporting the ARSOF 1<sup>st</sup> SWTG (A) training support added approximately $40 Million of unexpected total contract cost to the SOF RAPTOR III ceiling.

This transition of contract vehicles took advantage of SOF experience and expertise within PdM STS and reduced cost due to the lower overhead of the SOF RAPTOR III contract.

<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Email knwood@fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price contract with Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, California for the purpose of procuring a service agreement for its existing MiSeq FGx and NextSeq instruments.
<p>DSU is in the process of evaluating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) instruments and technologies in order to support the FBI Laboratory's DNA program activities by advancing the technologies applied to DNA casework and expanding the range of specimens from which probative data can be recovered. Now that NGS has been established as a worthy methodology for future DNA casework application, it is necessary for the DSU to evaluate and compare NGS instruments offered by other vendors in order to thoroughly and fairly assess the market options and determine the most promising platform for BAS applications. In order for DSU to continue its evaluation of NGS instruments, a maintenance contract for its existing Illumina NGS instruments is required. The contract will ensure the preventive maintenance needs, instrument failures, instrument upgrades, and other necessary items are addressed in a timely and cost-effective manner. This will in turn ensure that instrument testing can progress unhindered. The maintenance/service requirements are listed below.</p>
<p>&bull; Service Agreement for 4 MiSeq FGx instruments<br />&bull; Service Agreement for 1 NextSeq instrument<br />&bull; Coverage to include all parts and labor<br />&bull; 1 Preventative Maintenance service visit per year<br />&bull; Adequate and timely on-site response/support when necessary</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Illumina, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the MiSeq FGx and NextSeq instruments and its associated peripherals; therefore, they are the only company capable of providing the necessary service and support to include preventive maintenance needs, instrument failure coverage, instrument upgrades, and other necessary items for these instruments.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: KNWood@fbi.gov by Thursday, February 15, 2018 (12:00 pm Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price contract with Tecan U. S., Inc., 9401 Globe Center Dr Ste 140, Morrisville, NC 27560-6211 for the purpose of procuring training in the proper use of the software and maintenance of the Tecan instrument.
<p>The FBI is expanding the capabilities of their laboratory to better serve the forensics community. Specifically, the number of core CODIS loci analyzed by the Federal DNA Unit has increased. In order to be efficient with these new technologies, all personnel must be trained in the proper use of the software and maintenance of their instrumentation. The requested training will allow the FBI personnel to utilize all the Tecans to their fullest potential and in turn increase the throughput and efficiency of the Federal DNA Unit processes.</p>
<p>The training from the manufacturer, Tecan U. S., Inc. will give our biologists and examiners hands on experience with updated software and troubleshooting which will assist in a seamless implementation process. It is imperative that laboratory personnel are trained in the technology as well as the instruments and software created by Tecan in order to efficiently process and analyze the volume of samples submitted to the Unit on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Tecan U. S., Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the FBI's existing Tecan instruments and is the only vendor that can provide the required training on&nbsp;the proper use of the software and maintenance of the instrument.</p>

<DESC>The Malheur National Forest is requiring updates to their existing Remote Automated Weather Station. System upgrades consist of replacing sensors with the most upgraded equipment to meet communication requirements.<br /><br />Only the FTS products and systems will be supported by the RAWS Depot. Any other supplier's products would require a maintenance agreement that would be an additional expense over and above the current Depot agreements. The extensive network of RAWS locations requires not only annual maintenance but parts and upgrades to support improving technology and higher quality weather data for Wildland Firefighters and public safety. Maintaining consistency between weather station models within the fire organization is crucial to our mission for inter-agency and interoperability and safety. The Government intends to award a contract for this requirement. The suggested contractor is <strong>FOREST TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS; 1065 HENRY ENG PLACE; VICTORIA, BC. V9B 6-B2.<br /><br /></strong>This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all interested parties who believe they may meet these requirements, may submit in writing within 10 calendar days of this notification, complete information describing the ability to meet these requirements. Information will be used solely for purposes of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Companies that can provide an equal product must submit their Technical Capabilities to include Technical Specifications of their product, past performance information, price, and delivery time.<br /><br /><strong>All responses to this announcement must be directed to RaShauna Workman at: </strong><a href="mailto:rworkman@fs.fed.us"><strong>rworkman@fs.fed.us</strong></a><strong> no later than 1:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, February 19th, 2018. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.<br /><br /></strong>IAW FAR 52.202(a)(6), this acquisition will be ordered against an existing IDIQ contract under a GSA schedule and no other offers will be solicited for this requirement. IAW FAR 8.404(a), placing orders under the Federal Supply Schedule, contracts using the procedures of FAR 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement. A determination will be made by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The Requirement items are commercially available therefore, existing market forces support the cost reasonableness determination. <strong>The prices quoted are based on GSA Contract GS-07F-9253S. </strong>Per FAR 8.404(d), GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services at hourly rates, under schedule contracts are to be fair and reasonable. Market Research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Supply Schedules. Market Research indicates that; while the FTS supplies are not unique for all equipment or all parts; they are compatible with the weather stations. <br /><br />This is the only source available to purchase the required components and meet the delivery requirements of the agency. It was determined that no other FSS vendor has all parts and equipment or services on schedule that matches, has inter-connectivity to, and is compatiable with the existing requirements of the weather stations. This requirement is not available for "full and open competition" based on the need for these services and supplies in maintaining the integrity of the unit and delivery time.<br /><br />The use of FTS items and services is essential to program requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product or obtaining services by another company. Acquisition of a different brand would cause incompatibility with the existing component stations, delay in awarding, and not meet delivery requirements with the process of testing the integrity of the other manufacturers parts of equipment to these propriety components; would directly impact the Fire Program and have significant effects on firefighter and public safety.

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), has a requirement for the Model 1000SL Universal Testing Machine with Horizon Software Package.</p>
<p>The purchase of this equipment is vital to the success of current and future research projects. The stiff frame tester is required to fit in the current machine envelope and the following:</p>
<p>Be a replacement of the servo-controlled 200,000 lb stiff frame testing equipment currently utilized at the Spokane Campus under the Spokane Mining Research Division for testing of mine ground reinforcement items and standardized testing. A test machine of 200,000 lbs capacity for tension and compression cross-head capabilities to test ground support members and cementitious cylinders to ASTM standards is required. The envelope must have a 31x31x60 in capability for testing with pull claws and clamp heads to tension test support members. The extra-long pull rods on the machine provide capability not usual in standard testing, thus fitting the exact bolt and support member testing performed at the Spokane campus.<br />Either these reinforcements consist of steel members or cement-based castings. The tester is used to conduct an ASTM stroke or load control tests on the members brought to the laboratory. The current machine is 200,000 lbs capacity in both directions and takes up an envelope of 91x42x126 (x,y,z) inches. The testing table is 31x51-1/2x86 (x,y,z) inches and the test area envelope inside the stations is 31x31x60 (x,y,z) inches, Additionally the tension capability envelope is 31x31x72 (x,y,z) bottom of cross bar to top of crossbar. Speeds are 0.001 in/min to 6 in/min servo-controlled for position and load with 9 inches of stroke. A dual cross head configuration and gripping system were also required along with extended reinforcement bars and ample test area envelope.The floor space at the NIOSH Spokane Campus is available for the 36x24x126 (x,y,z) inches required by the testing machine with extensions along with the counsel of 40x33X34 (x,y,z).The replacement machine shall be designed for tension, compression, flexure and shear strength testing on materials and assemblies, the robust design that incorporates quality materials and components ensures that a superior performance and ease of testing are achieved. The software capable of both creep and high-speed testing 0-3 in/min allow for all test methods of both cementitious and homogenous types of supports tested. The capability to transfer the results directly and see a current reaction curve are also required for ASTM-type tests. The low-profile jaw cross-head also provides additional space for end affectors on the test specimen.</p>
<p>Where: Typical tests include (not all inclusive):<br />&bull; Unconfined compression tests<br />&bull; Indirect tension tests on rock cores (Brazilian tests and splitting tensile tests)<br />&bull; Tensile tests with rock bolt plates<br />&bull; Tension tests with short rock bolts<br />&bull; Tension tests with 2-ft x 2-ft wire mesh samples.<br />&bull; Couple shear tests on bolts<br />&bull; Bi-axial compression tests on rock cores<br />&bull; Backfill poisons ratio tests<br />&bull; Concrete/ Backfill/ Paste and Shotcrete compression and tensile tests<br />&bull; Pull test ram calibration</p>
<p>The software must have post processing capabilities built in with a library data base, active help desk menu and tabbed test data areas with accompanying graphs. A test live data window with multiple channels and rate selector must also be included. This system is also on a current windows format windows 8 or above (yr 2018).

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service intends to award a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Cooling Tower Replacement project at the Greensboro, NC NDC located at 3701 West Wendover Avenue, Greensboro, NC 27495-0001. All work will be accomplished in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $950,000 to $1,150,000 with construction completion within 270 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained.</p>
<p>(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.</p>
<p>(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.</p>
<p>(5) Contractors must submit information for three comparable security projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $500,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Information provided to the Contractorâ€™s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

The RTF Inductrix FPV from Blade builds on the Inductrix platform and transforms flying it into first-person experience. With its integrated 25mW video transmitter, FPV camera, high-performance motors, and 200mAh battery, the Inductrix FPV is designed to fly in the smallest of places with ease. SAFE technology helps makes flying simple for beginners, while the ducted propeller design allows means collisions with walls and objects won't be the end of the world. 
This is a Ready-to-Fly (RTF) bundle that comes with all of the essentials â€” including transmitter (radio controller), flight battery, and USB charger â€” in the box.
The Inductrix FPV is equipped with a 25mW video transmitter capable of transmission on Fat Shark channels 1 through 8 and all Raceband channels, enabling you to race several pilots at once without interference. You can choose channels from a selection button at the top of the drone. The camera is encased in a housing for added protection, while the dipole antenna has been chosen for video transmission with durability in mind. Video range of the Inductrix FPV is nearly 100 yards line-of-sight.
The included FPV monitor features 4.3" screen and a 32-channel FPV receiver. It works not only with the included camera, but other Spektrum and Fat Shark FPV products as well. The monitor integrates a USB-rechargeable battery that lasts approximately 1.5 hours. It can be clipped on to the MLP4 radio controller for hands-free operation. The monitor can also be paired with the separately available SPMVM430HA headset adapter, which effectively convents the display into FPV goggles.
The Inductrix FPV requires additional horsepower to fly with the added weight of the camera. It comes equipped with four high-performance 14,300 Kv motors.
Each rotor is housed in a true duct and is extremely quiet during flight. The benefit of using ducted fans instead of propellers is that they fully protect the fans during a crash and prevent the Inductrix from causing any damage to walls.
With brilliant white and red LED lighting illuminating each Inductrix FPV, it's easy to follow friends while flying together or even see if the battery is getting low when they begin to blink. The lights are mounted inside each frame, so they too will be protected in a crash.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS PROGRAM OFFICE'S<br />CONTRACT FOR THE FY2017 APPLICATION REVIEW</p>
<p>I. Background</p>
<p>The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program Office operates under the authority of FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate within the Department of Homeland Security. In FY 2017, Congress appropriated a total of $345 million under the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017, (Public Law 115-31) to carry out the activities of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program.</p>
<p>The Assistance to Firefighter Grant application review panel will be held from April 9 through April 13, 2018. This program generates thousands of applications with the program consistently receiving around 9,000 applications each year. This grant opportunity is competitive and each application must be evaluated independently against established criteria in order to assure fair and equitable opportunity for each. This independent evaluation is conducted by a panel of subject matter specialists who are flown in for one week to review and evaluate the applications.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the panel reviews, the program will need to secure commercial conference space and lodging for all participants. We expect that we will need lodging facilities to accommodate as many as 200 subject matter specialists who will be supported by up to 10 Federal employees and 20 contract support staff.</p>
<p>II. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The government requires lodging for all attendees participating in the FY2017 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) panel reviews during the projected week of April 8, 2018. It is the AFG program office's preference that conference facilities be located within a 50 mile radius of Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) or Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to identify the facility characteristics that are minimally necessary to provide lodging for individuals participating in the FY2017 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) panel review process. Specifically:</p>
<p>i. Conference facility with lodging services located within a within a 50 mile radius of Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) or Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA);</p>
<p>ii. Transportation to-and-from the airport via shuttle services;</p>
<p>iii. Conference/ballroom space to conduct the FY2017 AFG review panel;</p>
<p>iv. Securable breakout rooms or other workable space within the immediate proximity of the main conference area for support of the panel process;</p>
<p>v. High speed Internet connectivity to support government owned equipment;</p>
<p>vi. Free self-parking with unlimited access to enter and depart parking area is preferred;</p>
<p>vii. Restaurants within close proximity and accessibility is preferred;</p>
<p>viii. Comfortable chairs with cushioned seats, backs and arms;</p>
<p>ix. Audio-visual and internet technology support requirements will be requested by FEMA's support contractor and coordinated with the hotel upon award of the contract.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

OTC drugs are medicines sold directly to a consumer without a prescription. OTC drugs now account for about 60 percent of all medications used in the United States. The OTC monographs represent regulatory standards for the marketing of non-prescription drug products not covered by new drug applications. Those standards need to be continually updated to add, change, or remove ingredients or other pertinent information.</p>

<p>The Monographs Unit within NCTR's Office of Research is responsible for the systematic literature review for safety and effectiveness of OTC monographs active ingredients as requested by CDER.

<p>Contractor Performance Evaluation (s)<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.15, FDA will complete annual and final contractor performance evaluations.  Annual evaluations will be prepared to coincide with the anniversary date of the contract.  Additional interim performance evaluations may be prepared at the CO's discretion, as necessary. Final performance evaluations will be completed upon contract expiration.</p>
<p>FDA will utilize the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) in order to execute annual and final contractor performance evaluations. CPARS is a secure Internet website located at https://www.cpars.gov/main/cparsmain.htm. FDA will register the contractor in CPARS upon receipt of the name and email address of two (2) individuals who will be responsible for serving as the Contractor's primary and alternate CPARS contacts.  Once FDA registers the contractor in CPARS, the Contractor will receive an automated CPARS email message which contains User IDs and instructions for creating a password.</p>
<p>Once a performance evaluation is issued, the Contractor's primary and alternate CPARS contact will receive an email instructing them to logon to CPARS in order to review the performance evaluation.  The Contractor has 14 calendar days from the date of performance evaluation issuance in which to review the evaluation.  If the Contractor is in agreement with the performance evaluation outcome, the evaluation becomes final.  Should the Contractor be in disagreement with the performance evaluation outcome, rebuttal comments must be submitted via the CPARS within 30 days from date the evaluation was issued by FDA.  Any disagreement between the CO and the Contractor will be referred to a contracting official one level above the CO, whose decision will be final.</p>
<p>Copies of each performance evaluation and contractor responses, if any, will be retained as part of the official contract file and will be used to support future award decisions. Evaluations will also be stored for a 3 year period (6 years for construction) in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov.</p>
<p>Contractors may obtain CPARS training material and register for on-line training at https://www.cpars.gov/main/cparsmain.htm. There is no fee for registration or use of the CPARS system.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________	___________________<br />___________________	___________________<br />(2) Certification.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) &#9633; In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or<br />(2) &#9633; Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />&#9633; (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and<br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-<br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />&#9633; TIN: ________________________________.<br />&#9633; TIN has been applied for.<br />&#9633; TIN is not required because:<br />&#9633; Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br />&#9633; Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br />&#9633; Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government.<br />(4) Type of organization. <br />&#9633; Sole proprietorship;<br />&#9633; Partnership;<br />&#9633; Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br />&#9633; Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br />&#9633; Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br />&#9633; Foreign government;<br />&#9633; International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br />&#9633; Other ________________________________.<br />(5) Common parent. <br />&#9633; Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent;<br />&#9633; Name and TIN of common parent:<br />Name ________________________________.<br />TIN _________________________________.<br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>(1) Value Engineering studies involving new construction, repair or renovation, and/or design-build for Military, Environmental Restoration, and Civil Works projects for the federal government, or similar projects within the private sector.  Studies must comply with the requirements of paragraph 4.  VE studies facilitated by the prime or a Joint Venture partner will receive additional consideration over those facilitated by other members of the proposed team.  Value engineering studies that emphasized sustainable and environment stewardship (i.e. energy and water conservation technologies; use of recovered and recycled materials; waste reduction; reduction or elimination of toxic and harmful substances in facilities construction and operation; efficiency in resource and materials utilization) will receive higher ratings.  The evaluation will be based exclusively on the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(2) Quality management procedures.  Describe the offeror's quality management procedures (address in Section H of the SF 330).  The evaluation will consider the firm's quality management system and quality control procedures for value engineering studies (type and timing of reviews).  A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but may be required subsequent to award of a contract.</p>
<p>b.  Professional Qualifications</p>
<p>Responding firms shall demonstrate professional qualifications in these key disciplines:</p>
<p>1) Facilitator/Certified Value Specialist (CVS).<br />2) Architecture <br />3) Structural engineering <br />4) Mechanical engineering <br />5) Electrical engineering <br />6) Civil engineering<br />7) Fire protection engineering <br />8) Geotechnical engineering<br />9) Cost estimating</p>
<p>These key disciplines will all be considered of equal value in the evaluation.  The basis of evaluation will be information provided exclusively in section E of the SF 330.   The SF 330 shall include a matrix in Section G showing experience of the proposed lead personnel in each key discipline on the projects listed in Section F of the SF 330.  The education, professional registration, certifications, overall and relevant experience, and longevity with the firm will be considered.  Up to three resumes for each discipline will be evaluated.  The lead personnel for each discipline shall be clearly identified in section E.  This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel.  The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below.</p>
<p>c.  Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contract Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance.  CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting a SF330.  If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered.  In addition to CPARS, the board may seek information on past performance from other sources.</p>
<p>d.  Capacity to initiate work and complete within the time parameters of the project.</p>
<p>The evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in the following key disciplines: Facilitator/Certified Value Specialist (CVS); architect; structural engineer; mechanical engineer; electrical engineer; civil engineer; cost estimator.  The disciplines will be considered of equal value in the evaluation.  The evaluation will look at numbers listed in Part II of the SF330 to evaluate the overall capacity of the team.  Include a Part II form for each firm that is part of the proposed team.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the locality will not be a selection criterion for this contract.</p>
<p>SECONDARY SELECTION CRITERIA.  The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal.  The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation.  The three secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>e.  Geographic Proximity.   Responding firms should identify any offices operated in close proximity to the Leavenworth, KS/Greater Kansas City, MO metropolitan area and Seattle, WA metropolitan area and the contribution these office(s) will make in support of the project.  The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>f.  SB Participation.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), HUBZone small businesses, Veteran Owned small businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort.  The greater the participation, the greater the consideration.  Large businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>g.  Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months.

<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Criteria - Commercial Items:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a minimum of two BPA's from this solicitation to the responsible Offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on evaluation criteria. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability - to be determined technically acceptably offerors shall submit for evaluation, documentation of their capability to provide and deliver the specified supplies in accordance with the Performance Specifications.</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide sufficient documentation of their technical capability, by including technical literature, one to three page narrative addressing ability to provide and deliver products included in Performance Specifications, or any other information to enable the Government to determine the offeror's capability to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide price list addressing/displaying the unit cost of all items listed in the Performance Specification. If contractor has a commercial price list displaying the required items it shall be provided as an additional document.</p>
<p>2. Satisfactory Past Performance - to demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror shall provide documentation of satisfactory performance on past or current contracts (no more than 3-5 years old) of a similar type, size, scope and complexity, as well as, provide two (2) references, including names and contact information of references who can verify their past performance. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available. Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) will be provided as an attachment.<br /><br />The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient documentation and information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, and satisfactory past performance. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, and past performance may be cause for rejection of your submittal.</p>
<p><br />3. Price - Quotes will be evaluated by comparing offered prices to one another. Price quotes will be examined to determine the extent to which proposed prices are comparable with the Government estimates, and previous procurement history and a determination made of Price Reasonableness. The Government may reject any proposal that is determined to be Not Fair and Reasonable, unrealistically high or low in price when compared unbalanced, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the requirements.</p>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985).

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

<p>&nbsp;Question 24:- Can occupancy be on more than one floor if each space is secure?<br />Answer 24: No, the space needs to be contiguous. <br /><br />Question 25: Any other federal agencies you cannot locate with in the same building?<br />Answer 25&nbsp;No, any Government agency can be located&nbsp;in the same&nbsp;building as TSA.<br /><br />Question 26: Can you lease space in a building which is on a ground lease? <br />Answer&nbsp; 26: Yes, a ground floor lease is acceptable.<br /><br />Question 27:- Any column width restrictions? <br />Answer&nbsp; 27: A complete description of column requirements will be outlined in the SFO.<br /><br />28: Question- My prior question asked about warehouse space for the simulator and you said "no." Your recent clarification of 12' clear height for the simulator raises challenges in many "institutional grade Class A or B office space." That is taller than many office ceiling heights and with grid, ceiling tile and lights removed, still may have clear height challenges from sprinkler lines, VAV boxes and mechanical ductwork, relocation of which is economically difficult on a five year firm lease term. Since we know nothing about this simulator today, how big of an area for the simulator (12' clear height) is needed and are there any structural concerns (weight) about what floor it goes on? Could if for example go on a ground floor space (slab) and the balance of the office space be upstairs?<br />Answer - The size of the Simulator is 52 ft long x 18 ft wide by 9 ft high. The additional 3 ft of height is necessary for installation and maintenance. A complete simulator<br />&nbsp;construction package will be provided as part of the SFO package which should be used by the lessor to determine if there are structural concerns (weight) for their building.<br /><br />Question- 29:&nbsp;Is seismic RP8? <br />Answer&nbsp; 29: All TSA Buildings must meet RP8 requirements.</p>

<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID" or the "Agency") is seeking proposals to enable USAID's energy programs to respond to a broad range of Agency priorities, including post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction, regional security, and environmental stewardship for the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment ("E3") as described in the attached Request for Proposals ("RFP"). USAID anticipates awarding Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts (up to eight IDIQ contracts, of which up to three may be reserved for small business concerns).  USAID reserves the right to award more or less awards than this anticipated number or to make no award.</p>
<p>USAID invites all interested and responsible organizations to submit offers in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. USAID will conduct this procurement as a full and open competition under which any type of organization may submit a proposal. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern the procurement. The North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") Code is 541990. The Authorized Geographic Code for procurement of goods and services under any task order issued under this IDIQ Contract is 935.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will not exceed $500,000,000 over the five (5)-year ordering period. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Upon award of the Energy IDIQ II contracts, USAID anticipates issuing one initial Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee ("CPFF") Term task order. The period of performance for this task order is five years, and the total estimated cost ("TEC') for this task order is between $20,000,000 and $23,000,000. Prospective offerors must submit questions about this solicitation to Matthew Courtad (mcourtad@usaid.gov), Selam Demissie (sdemissie@usaid.gov), and Tseyone Demissie (tsdemissie@usaid.gov) by the time and date indicated above. Offerors must submit proposals electronically in accordance with the instructions contained in Section L, "Instructions to Offerors." Offerors should take into account the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and they are responsible for ensuring proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time as specified in Section L.  Failure to comply with the submission date will deem any submission unacceptable and it will not be reviewed or evaluated.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>The issuance of this RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. Award of a contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.</p>
<p>This RFP can be viewed and downloaded from www.fedbizopps.gov.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same website from which you downloaded the solicitation. USAID advises to regularly check the above website for amendments.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br />for</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Contract Undergraduate Pilot Training Support for United States Air Force (CUPT)</strong></p>
<p>This is an RFI in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />1. This RFI includes a description of the CUPT requirement, a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your company's capability, and Course Training Standards (CTS) (upon request through www.FBO.gov). <br />2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />3. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 30 pages, and identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their responses are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.<br />4. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.<br />5. The Government anticipates a Firm-Fixed-Price contract could come from these efforts. For purposes of this RFI, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611512, Flight Training and the small business size standard is $27.5 Million in annual gross receipts.<br />6. AETC plans to host an Industry Day event following the RFI results (around March 2018 at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph) in order to have further exchanges with industry. Details will follow with a subsequent posting on www.FBO.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose:</strong><br />1. We are conducting market research to: <br />a. Determine the extent to which commercial sources are capable of conducting the operations associated with CUPT (flying operations, academics, aircraft maintenance, security, etc.)?<br />b. Determine potential locations capable of supporting CUPT requirements.<br />c. Determine efficiencies/cost savings which can be gained through different approaches to all aspects of the CUPT requirements?<br />d. Determine a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate pertaining to the cost and level of effort of this service.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />Currently, the Air Force is experiencing a shortage of pilots across the total force. In order to grow the inventory required to close this gap over the next five to ten years requires an increase in pilot production in excess of the capacity of the existing UPT bases. One solution to temporarily increase capacity is to establish a contract training capability to augment the capacity of the existing structure. This contract training program will provide UPT training capacity to help increase the net production of pilots and reduce the pilot shortage.</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br />Beginning in 2019 CUPT will use a modified AETC UPT syllabus to produce 80-100 graduates per year in an UPT program, with the capability to produce up to 120 graduates per year. In this construct the contractor would provide training for Phase 1 (pre-flight ground training), Phase 2 (T-6 flight training), Phase 3 (T-38C flight training) and all associated academic and simulator training to comply with the modified AETC syllabus.</p>
<p>USAF will provide T-6A and T-38C training aircraft as well as a modified syllabus for each Phase of training.</p>
<p>USAF will provide on-site aircraft supply chain management and aircraft-specific support equipment (equipment that is normally only Government supplied).<br />USAF students will procure their own lodging and food.</p>
<p>CUPT will be located at the contractor provided location OR at a government provided location; ROMs should be developed for both options. Contractor provided location, at a minimum, should include two parallel runways: one 8,000ft and one 6,000ft as well as an auxiliary airfield, operating airspace within 100 miles, and ramp/hangar space to support T-6A and T-38C aircraft.</p>
<p>USAF will provide oversight via Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) for the overall program to include maintenance and operational oversight and student management, up to 34 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements: </strong><br />Contractor will provide:</p>
<p>Instructor Pilots (IPs) and Maintenance personnel and conduct training in accordance with the AETC provided syllabus and Program Flying Training (PFT) guidance.</p>
<p>Simulation devices (part task trainers, simulators, virtual reality, etc.) or equivalent capabilities to satisfy simulator syllabus events. The USAF will approve the intended devices to ensure that it satisfies the simulator requirements of the syllabus.</p>
<p>Adequate aircraft shelters in the event of inclement weather.</p>
<p>Security or arrange to have security provided for all on campus personnel, training facilities and aircraft IAW Department of Homeland of Security Risk Management Process: An Interagency Security Committee Standard, 2nd Edition 2016.</p>
<p>Maintenance of all aircraft, facilities, and other property.<br />&bull; Maintenance will be responsible for all aspects of the organizational and intermediate-level maintenance operation, including, but not limited to:<br />o Managing the full cycle of production by planning, scheduling, directing, and controlling all maintenance on assigned T-38C and T-6A aircraft in accordance with all AFIs and AETCIs, to include related support and training equipment<br />o Performing on-and off-equipment maintenance (repairs, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, inspections, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs), Time Change Items (TCls) and One Time Inspections (OTls)) on all assigned aircraft and support equipment.

<DESC><p>I. RFI Overview: The Army Contracting Command-Redstone (ACC-Redstone) is seeking information concerning the interest and availability of capable contractors to provide contract support to the Aviation and Missile Command's (AMCOM) Aviation Field Maintenance (AFM) program. This is a follow-on market research for the Sources Sought Notice released 14 April 2016. If you responded to the Sources Sought Notice posted 18 Feb 2015 or 14 April 2016, you do not need to respond again. <br /><br />AMCOM Aviation Field Maintenance (AFM) II Contract: This contract will provide rotary wing aviation field and sustainment level maintenance support, aircraft modifications, and other logistical services for Aviation customers worldwide. With the number of Reset sites reducing, future work emphasis will shift to support for the Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB), separate Battalions, Detachments, National Guard/Reserve aviation units, and other Departments or Agencies through: Passback maintenance, Maintenance Work Order (MWO) application, installation aviation activities, and other level of effort tasks. Reference the attached DRAFT AFM II PWS that provides potential scope to be performed.<br /><br />Contract Background, Type, and Anticipated Period of Performance: The Government must have a contract vehicle that allows for flexibility as Army aviation maintenance and modification requirements are subject to change year-to-year. The AFM II contract will be a hybrid type contract which will predominately include a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), and Time and Materials (T&amp;M) type effort for touch labor and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for program management (PM). The total contract period of performance will include a 90 day transition period, a base year and seven one-year option periods. The contract shall contain the clauses at FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services", and FAR 52.217-9 "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract" to provide for a bridge contract should it be necessary.<br /><br />The AFM II contract structure will still support the Army aviation maintenance "regional" concept. The Government will conduct a best value full and open competition. There will be two separate requests for proposal (RFP) from which two separate contracts will be awarded. One contract will be for the East Region (AFM - East) and one for the West Region (AFM-West) (Figure 1 - See Attachment 1). Contractors must submit a proposal for each desired regional contract effort. Regional proposals will be evaluated independently. The base year will be awarded. Sixty days prior to the conclusion of each contract period the contractor will be notified if the Government intends to award an option year. Options will be utilized in order to help stabilize a program driven by OMA funding, and at the same time, allow for the easy replacement of a contractor should they fail to meet the Government's expectations.<br />&nbsp;<br />Location: The location of the effort to be performed by the AFM II requirement will be both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). Each region will have CONUS and OCONUS responsibility and aligned along Combatant Commander's (COCOMs) area of responsibility worldwide. The total number of sites for each region is variable (10 - 20+) based on surge/contingency efforts at the time of award. AFM requirements are considered services with the appropriate services laws and regulations being applicable. All contracts awarded will include the Ground and Flight Risk clause and will require a higher level of quality requirements to include Aerospace Standard 9110 (current version). It is anticipated that North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, will apply. The current standard is $32.5M.<br />&nbsp;<br />Unique Evaluation Elements: Offerors must meet unique entrance gate criteria in order to proceed on to a full proposal evaluation. The technical evaluation will consist of a Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP) and response(s) to integrated management scenario(s).<br /><br />Corporate Capability Statements: The ACC-Redstone seeks to identify businesses that have experience in all or a part of the requirements described in this document and the attached PWS. Interested parties should provide a Corporate Capability Statement that reflects their potential to fulfill the Government's requirements. Note that any actual requirement(s) will eventually be announced through FedBizOpps. Interested companies should include in their response answers to the following requests:</p>
<p>a. Company Name, address, phone number, and email address</p>
<p>b. Notification of interest in proposing as a prime contractor, subcontractor or both</p>
<p>c. Details related to the size of the company based on the anticipated NAICS code of 488190</p>
<p>d. Company profile to include company size (small or large) in relation to the proposed NAICS, etc. Identification of small business type (i.e., SDB, SDVOSB, 8(a), etc.) <br /><br />Proprietary Information: Proprietary information is neither sought nor desired. If proprietary information is submitted, it must clearly be marked "Proprietary" on every sheet containing such information. Respondents are responsible for adequately marking proprietary information contained in their response. Do not send any classified information.<br /><br />II. This RFI pertains to sources sought, corporate capability statements, and DRAFT PWS information for the AFM II effort. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. Any formal solicitation(s) will be announced separately. <br /><br />The draft solicitation for industry's comments may be released in the third quarter of Calendar Year (CY) 2017 for the AFM II effort. However, these dates are estimates and subject to change without notice. Source Selection will be conducted per applicable guidance of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 and supplemental guidance. Note that only responses are solicited under this RFI. No written questions will be entertained. Contacts to Government personnel by potential offerors regarding this RFI subject are restricted and must proceed through the Contracting Officer POC. The Contracting Officer, Ms. Nicole Sullivan-Williams has posted all current information regarding this requirement on the FedBizOpps website.<br /><br />Small Business Set-Aside Determination: In order for the Government to make a Small Business set-aside determination, all Small Business should provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all requirements of the magnitude described in the Draft PWS.<br /><br />Points of Contact<br />Email is the preferred method of communication. Telephone calls will not be accepted.</p>

<p><br />**IMPORTANT TCN &amp; SHIPPING INFORMATION**</p>
<p>Additional information:</p>
<p>TCNs are unique identifiers and they can only be used once. Given the size of this order, multiple TCNs will most likely be necessary. The method of packing and shipping these items will determine the number of TCNs required. For example, if individual boxes are sent, they will each need a TCN. However, if the boxes are palletized and shrink-wrapped, one TCN can be used on both the shipping label and packing list. Also, receiving, processing and shipping these items will be much easier if the vendor can provide the following information prior to shipment to JAX:</p>
<p>1. Will the boxes be palletized and shrink-wrapped?<br />2. If so, the number and size of the pallets<br />3. Will the items be sent in multiple shipments?<br />4. Estimated date for arrival at JAX?</p>

Paragraph 5 of the original pre-solicitation announcement for SF330s is supplemented as follows:
The primary NAICS code for this procurement is 541310 Architectural Services with a Small Business (SB) Size Standard of $7.5 million. The primary SDVOSB AE submitting the SF330 package must meet this size standard to be eligible for award.
      2. Paragraph 7. g. of the original pre-solicitation announcement for SF 330s is modified as follows:
g. Geographic Location - Location in the general geographical area of the project. Must have an office from which design work and construction site visits will originate that is within 250 driving miles of the closest VA Medical Center listed in paragraph 2 of this announcement. Driving distance shall be calculated using the Google Maps (maps.google.com) directions tool by entering the AE office address as the starting point and closest VA medical center address as the destination. The resulting mileage driving distance (fastest route) shall be the official calculation for the purposes of this factor to determine if the geographic location requirement is met. A print out of the results shall be attached to the SF330 qualification package. The AE office location must be listed in the SF 330 application and must also be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM   www.sam.gov).

<DESC>VA250-17-R-0138 AE Multi-Disciplinary IDIQ MODIFICATION 2

Paragraph 5. of the original pre-solicitation announcement for SF 330s is modified as follows:

SET-ASIDE INFORMATION: This procurement is a Total Set-Aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) AE firms. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes is 541310, Architectural Services, however NAICS codes 541320 Landscape Architectural Services and 541330 Engineering Services are also required as this is a multi-disciplinary AE requirement and therefore experience and qualifications for all three AE services are being evaluated as part of this solicitation (see professional qualifications being evaluated in paragraph 7. a.) -  (Other AE services that may be required under any resultant contract include 541340 Drafting Services, 541360 Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services, and 541370 Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services however these services are not required to be included as part of the SF330 qualification package and will not be included as part of the evaluation process. An AE submitting a SF330 package may voluntarily include qualifications for these types of services as information only so the DVA may establish a database of those firms offering these types of services. Not providing any qualification information for the other AE services will have no impact on an AE s rating). The Government intends to make eight (8) awards to qualified SDVOSB AE firms. Verification of SDVOSB status will be done via confirming current registration in the Center for Veterans Enterprise   Vendor Information Pages database (vip.vetbiz.gov). Firms submitting a qualification package must have a current registration in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov). The awarded contracts will be firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The IDIQ contracts will be for one base year from the date of award with options to extend the term of the contracts for four (4) additional one year periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government, or until the maximum contract amount of $75,000,000.00 awarded across all IDIQs is reached, whichever is earlier.  Each contract awarded will have a guaranteed minimum order of $1,500.00 for the total of the base year and all option years.  The minimum value of any individual Task Order is $2,500.00 with a maximum Task Order value of $1,000,000.00.  Each specific IDIQ Task Order shall be separately negotiated based on the A/E effort involved.
2. Paragraph 7 of the original pre-solicitation announcement is modified in its entirety as follows:

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this
notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be
considered for award.<BR><BR>The apparent  awardee shall acknowledge acceptance of any and all re-postings (amendments), in writing, prior to any award resulting from this solicitation.<BR><BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 335312

registered in that NAICS prior to receipt of quote in order to receive an
award. Offeror are reminded that failure to comply â€œshall render their quote
as non-responsive.â€<BR><BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use
commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT seeks to lease the following office space through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP):<br />State: North Dakota<br />City: Rapid City<br />Delineated Area: Rapid City Downtown Area Plan East of East BLVD. <br />Minimum ABOA Sq. Ft.: 6800<br />Maximum ABOA Sq. Ft.: 7000<br />Parking: 12 spaces<br />Space Type:	Office<br />Term:	Up to 15 Years<br />Agency Specific Requirements:
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG08. In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers. Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with RLP 17-REG08 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease. All documents can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Caribbean-Florida Water Science Center (CFWSC) has a requirement to establish Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ) base year with four option year periods. The minimum requirements for the tags that's needed to provide satellite-location only, whereas we need others that provide satellite-location plus depth, and still others that provide GPS location, satellite-location, plus depth, and another model that is an accelerometer (i.e., acceleration data logging tags or ADLs). We anticipate that annually we will need a mix of 40-60 tags, depending on future funding and project goals. The need is project-based, and we have 2 current projects where we need both location and depth, but we need to have flexibility in the size of the tags because we may get juvenile turtles that cannot be tagged with the largest models of tags. We also need flexibility in programming the tags (i.e., we need to be able to program them once we have them in the field) because on these new projects, we do not yet know which species we may be capturing; we would program a tag differently for a green turtle versus a loggerhead versus a Kemp's ridley versus a hawksbill. As well, for any adult males captured, we may need to program the tags differently from how we would program them for adult females whom we know more about from decades of tracking studies around the globe. 

There are four option year periods.
Request for Proposal (RFP) 140G0118R0003 will be issued on or about 02/09/2018 with written proposals due on or about 03/06/2018. This acquisition is total small business set-a-side. The NAICS code is 334513. The size standard is $750 employees.
The anticipated award date of the contract is 03/16/2018. A vendor must be registered at
https://www.sam.gov/index.html to be awarded the contract.
All responsible sources may submit a bid or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Responses may be emailed to abenton@usgs.gov or mailed to the address specified in the solicitation.

<DESC><p>The proposed action is a contract for Zevo SD DEGEN implants and Instruments, CD Horizon Solera Instruments, CD Horizon Solera implants, Capstone PTC 22 MM and 26MM implants, Capstone PTC 32MM implants, Capstone PTC instrument set, and Posterior Microscope instruments for a surgical team to perform a follow-up spinal surgery. The procedures in FAR subpart 13.5 will be implemented for this requirement; as an urgent and compelling for an emergency spinal surgery follow-up for three patients that cannot be moved without causing injury or further damage to the patients. Further absence of the immediate follow-up procedure would result in unacceptable delays rendering irreversible damage to the patients and since the first procedures products and implants from Medtronic were used, the recommendation from the surgeons is to use the same manufacturer in case products/implants are determined to be used for the follow-up procedure. MMD will return unused instruments and implant sets to the contractor upon the completion of the emergency surgical procedures. Once instruments and implant sets are returned to the contractor, the Government will only be charged for instruments and implants used. The proposed source is Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc, 1800 Pyramid Place, Memphis, TN, 38132-1703.</p>

<DESC><strong>February 9, 2018:</strong> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-3(d) only requires the agency to furnish a supplier a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision, not an actual "debriefing" as would be required under FAR 15.506. Since award was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision is provided as follows: "<em>FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) procedures were used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. Both Factor I - Technical Acceptability and Factor II - Price were important to the overall award decision. As such, the Government made an award to <strong>Strativia LLC</strong> whose submission was determined to be fair and reasonably priced, the lowest priced, and technically acceptable."</em>

Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition
6.302-5   Authorized or required by statute 

1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Strategic Acquisition Center in Frederick, Maryland on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Benefits Assistance Service (BAS).
 
2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

This action is a non-competitive award (sole-source) with The Bowen Consulting Group, LLC. (Bowen), a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), for the procurement of VBA Insurance Call Center and Fiduciary Program Discovery and Survey Design Satisfaction Research Program. This sole source is necessary because VBA s customer satisfaction research programs provide valuable feedback from Service members, Veterans and their dependents, and such feedback enables the administration to know what is most important to its customers in order to continue its modernization efforts, identify key performance indicators, and achieve the Secretary s priorities (Greater Choice for Veterans, Modernize our Systems, Focus our Resources more Efficiently, Improve Timeliness of Services, and Suicide Prevention).  

3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency s needs (including the estimated value). 

The proposed action will develop survey instruments for the VBA Fiduciary Service and Insurance Service Call Center.  This requirement was identified during FY17.  The new requirement would require a discovery session with each division and the creation of new survey instruments. 

An independent government cost estimate (IGCE) placed the cost of the new survey development at $596,549.36. An account with the One VA Plus (1VA+) for the FY17 funding was created to protect the approved funding.  The period of performance is from January 31, 2018 until January 30, 2019. 

The contractor shall offer Program Management in accordance with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).  The contractor shall develop materials such as interview guides to be utilized during virtual and onsite discovery meetings for each business line. The contractor shall utilize this knowledge to develop a survey instrument design for each division.  They will also provide support during the development of the survey methodology and cognitive lab testing.  

These survey instruments will help VA improve the Veteran experience by understanding the customer s perspective during select interactions with the VA.  If this additional support is not obtained, VA will not have the necessary skills or resources to design a survey instrument that captures the program needs. 


4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is Public Law (PL) 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program, as codified at 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 and implemented at Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Subsection 819.7007.

5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

38 U.S.C. 8127(c) permits a contracting officer to award a contract to a Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) verified SDVOSB using procedures other than competition if:

such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;

the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of title 41) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and

in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. 
   
The proposed action meets all three of the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 8127(c). 

Bowen has been verified by CVE as owned and controlled by a service-disabled veteran and has the corporate knowledge to develop materials such as interview guides to be utilized virtually and onsite.   Bowen has successfully provided services similar to the required services to other agencies and was initially awarded the competitively procured Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Voice of the Veteran.  Bowen s quote was determined the best value to the Government based on the merits of the quote.  Therefore, VA sent the solicitation to Bowen for the first call order.  Subsequently, the BPA was protested and VA took corrective action.  Regardless, the Contracting Officer initially found Bowen to offer the best value, reasonable price, and made a determination of responsibility prior to the protest.  Bowen is also registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) as an SDVOSB under the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 for Administrative Management Consulting Services.  As such, Bowen is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of this opportunity.

The anticipated award price of the contract is $596,549.36 and, therefore, does not exceed the statutory threshold of $5,000,000.

The contracting officer estimates that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States. Bowen has already competed and was initially awarded the Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with the VA for the Voice of the Veteran (VOV) program Bowen used their General Schedule Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) rates for the VOV competition. In accordance with FAR 8.404 (d), GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. . Most importantly, the contracting officer will not award a contract without first determining that the proposed price is fair and reasonable and the offer represents best value.

6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

In accordance with 819.7007(b), the determination to make a sole source award to an SDVOSB is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer; therefore, the requirement to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable is not applicable to this procurement.  In addition, 819.7007(c) further authorizes the contracting officer to make the award without first determining that only one SDVOSB source can meet the requirement.  This effort was intended to be the first call order under the competitively awarded BPA; however, the protest and subsequent corrective action precluded award as an order.  VA had solicited the order prior to corrective action determination.  The funding associated with this action expires January 31, 2018 and the effort is required prior to that time.  Future actions will be competed to the fullest extent practicable.

The agency will make publicly available the justification required by 6.305(a) within 14 days after contract award.

7.  A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on historical pricing data agreed to in one or more VA contracts for the same or similar services.  

8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

VA conducted extensive market research and The Strategic Acquisition Center   Frederick (SAC-F) solicited a set aside procurement to SDVOSBs via General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 874-1 for the VOV BPA. Award of the BPA was finalized in November 17, 2017 and after award decision SAC-F received a protest. Determinations were made in December 2017 to take corrective action of the award decision in order to re-evaluate due to a minor error.  

Market research was conducted using CVE s Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database to ensure that Bowen is verified by CVE as an SDVOSB.  The VIP search confirmed that Bowen is verified by CVE.  In addition, Bowen has been determined to be responsible, and is registered in the SAM as a small business under the relevant NAICS code. 

9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

The FAR allows restrictive provisions or conditions to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the agency or as authorized by law (FAR Subsection 11.002(a)(1)(ii)). As such, the Government has discretion to reasonably restrict competition as long as that requirement is needed to meet the agency s minimum need.

10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None.

11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

The awarded VOV BPA was competed and it was initially determined that the Bowen Group provided the best value to the Government.  Due to the delays based on the protest and the corrective action, a  sole-source contract will be for 12 months for the required services.  Future actions will be competed to the fullest extent practicable.

Currently, the 36 MDG uses Siemens Dimension EXL which uses wet technology and currently has an external<br />water source that has been discontinued. In order to keep functionality of the current system, the clinic will need to<br />perform an extensive infrastructure modification to accommodate a new water source to install a new water system<br />that provides the required high quality distilled water. The retrofit of the infrastructure is costly and the work will<br />take up to a year for completion which will impact the 36 MDG's ability to deliver quality health care to their clients.<br />The 36 MDG Clinical Laboratory Services is requesting the reagent rental of the Ortho Vitros 350 Chemistry System for<br />a twelve month base period with two 12-month options periods. The reagent rental agreement will encompass the use<br />of the analyzer, reagents and supplies, training, maintenance, and installation compliant with the FDA 510K, Clinical<br />Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and CAP standards.<br />A full service contract is included in this reagent rental/purchase program. This is inclusive of all parts and labor. A<br />minimum of two local service personnel will be trained on how to service the VITROS&reg; 350 System. A primary supply<br />of parts will be maintained on island. In the case local service is unable to resolve the problem, service will be<br />dispatched from Japan. Primary Service will be available through the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Technical Support<br />Center. This hotline (1-800-421-3311) is open 24 hours a day. Primary on-site service will be guaranteed a maximum<br />of 24 hours after identifying the need for service. Secondary manufacturer service from off-island is guaranteed after<br />being identified as necessary by the primary on-island service personnel.<br />The Ortho Vitros 350 instrument will provide Andersen AFB Laboratory with a safe, FDA-approved diagnostic analyzer<br />for the measurement of 22 chemical components in human serum and plasma<br />Section C: Justification for Soliciting from a Single Source or Brand Name<br />The 36 MDG currently utilizes Siemens Dimension EXL which uses wet technology requiring an external water source<br />that has been discontinued. In order to keep functionality of the current system, the clinic will need to perform an<br />extensive infrastructure modification to accommodate a new water source to install a new water system that provides<br />the required high quality distilled water. The retrofit of the infrastructure is costly and the work will take up to a year<br />for completion which will impact the 36 MDG's ability to deliver quality health care to their clients.<br />The Ortho Vitros 350 system does not require an external water supply, a key element in disaster planning and<br />contingencies as well as eliminating a primary cause of technical difficulties, shortens turnaround time, and provides a<br />wide range of menu.<br />Having the Ortho Vitros 350 System will enable correlation of lab results between the 36 MDG and US Naval Hospital,<br />therefore reducing and/or eliminating the need to retest patients. The current system requires additional maintenance<br />due to carryover considerations.<br />Additionally, the MicroSlide technology and calibration stability up to lot change (maximum 6 months) mean labor can<br />Single Source Justification (Simplified Acquisition)<br />20 Apr 2017 Page 2 of 3<br />be dedicated to value-added tasks. The current system requires calibrations every 3 months. The shorter sample<br />volume requirement is ideal for use with pediatric and geriatric patients.<br />The Ortho Vitros 350 provides for the use of single-use disposable tips, which eliminates carryover and addresses<br />cross-contamination concerns. The current Siemens Dimension EXL system requires additional maintenance due to<br />carryover considerations.<br />A critical part to the system is the consumable reagent cartridges used by the instrument, which are unique to the<br />system and proprietary of Ortho Clinical. The only known source that can distribute and manufacture the reagent<br />cartridges needed is Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. Using non approved reagents would invalidate each individual test<br />and the instrument. We would be in violation with the FDA, Joint Commission, Clinical Laboratory Improvement<br />Amendments of 1988, and the College of American Pathologists accreditations.<br />Section D: Efforts to Obtain Competition<br />Other systems were evaluated based on the needs of the facility to include methodology, system dimensions, tests<br />throughput, and maintenance requirements. Additionally, other platforms offered by the current vendor were<br />evaluated and no other systems besides the instrument currently in-house meet the needs of the facility.<br />The Ortho Vitros 350 is the only known source that uses dry technology, which would not require a infrastructure<br />modification to the clinic.
