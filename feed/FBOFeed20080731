PBGC expects this Strategic Partnership arrangement to include senior attention from the highest levels of the winning firm(s).  The contract, with options, could extend for a period of ten years.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research intends to execute a modification to add additional funds to an existing contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) awarded  to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute on September 23, 2005 on a competitive basis.  The purpose of this modification is to increase the level of funding in the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute contract to allow the contractor to increase their level of effort to perform the increasing numbers of drug safety studies needed within the original scope of work.  The following studies have been identified as serious drug safety issues requiring additional funds for studying expeditiously: Study 1. Medications for ADHD and Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Disease in Adults:  Addition of Stroke Endpoint:  Kaiser Foundation Research Institute completed an FDA-sponsored feasibility study in which they were determined to have an appropriate number of drug users and outcomes to allow for pooling of their data with other sites (also completing feasibility studies) to conduct an in-depth study.  Phase I of the in-depth study included the analysis of automated data.  Phase II of the study was initiated with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as a co-sponsor.  The adult portion of the study was launched in this phase to investigate risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death associated with drugs used to treat ADHD. Kaiser Foundation Research Institute shall complete the work associated with Phase II which includes visiting sites, pulling records and adjudicating events.  All electronically identified strokes in adults shall require confirmation.  Reviewers will confirm the diagnosis from the medical record, and will identify potential exclusions due to other diagnoses. An Events Adjudication Committee (AEC) will be established to make final decisions.  Study 2. Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHC):  The objective of the CHC Study is to evaluate use of contraceptive products in a population of new and prevalent users to assess the public health impact and patterns of use that could place a woman at greater risk for a thromboembolic event and/or death.  The large number of deaths available for study at  Kaiser Permanente and other sites, as well as the large number of contraceptive users identified in the feasibility study, provide us with a valuable opportunity to assess this important public health concern.  The initial phase (Phase I) of this study will consist of an incidence analysis of thrombotic and thromboembolic events (TTE) and death for all qualifying members based on claims data confirmed with medical record review.  Study 3. Kaiser is working to complete Phase 1 of the PROBE Study.  Phase I involved a dental symptom survey mailed to 13,946 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who received oral bisphosphonates for &#8805;1 year.  The remainder of the funds received for the PROBE Study Phase I effort are being devoted to completing the dental records review and survey data cleaning, checking Kaiser electronic databases to verify that no cases of ONJ were overlooked among the survey respondent cohort, and preparing demographic tables and key variables necessary for the Phase I manuscript (prevalence of ONJ among patients with oral bisphosphonate exposure).  These activities are expected to run in parallel to the Phase II effort.  Study 4.  For the Medication Use in Pregnancy Study, Kaiser shall develop and maintain an integrated dataset that would be used to study medication use from conception through delivery (pregnancy) and associated birth outcomes.  Kaiser is well equipped to fulfill the five main tasks of the study:  1. Maternal-infant record linkage of all women delivering an infant between 2001 and 2007 (or the most recent date available); 2. Linkage to birth certificate data, infants delivered between 2001 and 2007 (or the most recent date available); 3. Validation of data elements in datasets; 4. Linkage to other databases; 5. Annual update of maternal-infant files / linkage to birth certificate data. Study 5.  For the Oral Bisphosphonate Use and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation Among Older Women Study, Kaiser shall utilize a large, community-based population of older women to assess the association between use of oral bisphosphonate therapy andn the risk of atrial fibrillation among women treated in usual clinical care.  The two aims of the study are to 1. examine the association between oral bisphosphonate therapy and hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or emergent cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, after adjustment for known risk factors, other comorbidity, and concomitant therapies; and 2. examine the association between oral bisphosphonate therapy and the risk of incident atrial fibrillation, after adjustment for known risk factors and concomitant therapies.These additional funds will support Phase II which will focus on better understanding the risk factors for ONJ.  Phase II will complete the primary PROBE study which focused on the dual aims of prevalence (Phase I) and predictors of ONJ and ONJ-like conditions (Phase II).  The volume of studies that need to be conducted through this contract has greatly increased since award, due to an increased awareness within FDA of potential drug safety issues that can be studied.  There has also been increasing awareness of these types of resources and their value by those outside of FDA, such as the Institute of Medicine and Congress.  Recent legislation, Section 905(A)(4) of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), mandates expansion of these resources for the purpose of providing timely assessments of drug safety data.  Therefore, CDER must continue to work with the Kaiser to conduct study analyses to the benefit of the publics health; respond expeditiously to urgent public safety concerns; provide a mechanism for collaborative pharmacoepidemiological research designed to test hypotheses, particularly those arising from suspected adverse reactions reported to FDA; and Enable rapid access to U.S. population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary.  This is not a Request for Proposals.   No Solicitations will be issued. However, sources interested in this requirement must provide statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirement of this synopsis can be met.  A determination by the Government to compete this procurement based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   A modification to the contract will be executed on or after August 14, 2008.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis a serum autoantibody test for detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from Dr. Li Zhong of Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, 1500 Duarte Rd., Duarte, California 91010-3000.
	
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI conducts intramural research in areas related to nutrition and cancer aimed at lowering human cancer risk. One focus of NEB research is esophageal cancer, especially in high-risk populations.  NEB scientists have performed studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in high-risk areas of the world for over 20 years. 

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a relatively uncommon cancer in the United States, but it is one of the most common fatal cancers worldwide. It has a 5-year survival rate of <16%. The principal reason for this poor survival is that most tumors are asymptomatic and go undetected until they have reached a late stage and cannot be cured. Significant reduction in esophageal cancer mortality will require successful strategies to diagnose and treat asymptomatic precursor lesions and early cancers. The goal of this study is to develop a blood test that can discover patients with these early stages of ESCC.

The NCI Nutritional Epidemiology branch plans to take advantage of immune surveillance, the capacity of the immune system to identify tumor-specific proteins and produce autoantibodies against these proteins. To make a screening test, autoantibodies will be selected based on their presence in the blood of cancer patients and their absence in the blood of healthy controls. The cases and controls participants in this study shall be from Shanxi Province in China, a population at high risk for ESCC. 

Dr. Li Zhong of the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope has extensive experience developing autoantibody early detection tests and has developed and published on a very promising autoantibody test for lung cancer. Dr. Zhongs laboratory developed the only ESCC phage display library in existence, and is the only laboratory known to the NCI that can create the protein array slides necessary for this project.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on August 14, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80151-MM on all correspondence.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT), intends to procure on a sole-source basis for LANrev Automated Client Management for Mac and Windows Computers with LANrev LP, 4287 Beltline Road, Addison, TX 75001.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511210 and the business size standard is $25M.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, NCI has used Novell's ZENworks for Desktops application to manage and perform application deployment and inventory and asset management functions to Microsoft Windows desktop computers.  In addition, the Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) application has been used to patch management for Microsoft applications on NCI desktops.</p>
<p>In a recent NCI audit conducted by the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a major finding was presented indicating that use of these products did not result in effective centralized patch management.  Since the audit results were published, the NCI has been mandated to implement the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) program.  A key component of the FDCC effort is the limitation of end-user administration rights and the ability of users to install software and software changes including patches and updates.  The currently used ZENworks package can no longer be used since it requires end-user administrative action to download and install updates and patches from a central software repository.</p>
<p>Additionally, the currently used products do not provide any capability to provide management, control, and security to Apple Macintosh computers.  Not providing tightly controlled and secure updates and patches to the Mac desktops is a potential vulnerability to the NCI networks and thereby other, non Mac, devices.</p>
<p>LANrev is a commercial off-the-shelf software product that will provide centralized application deployment, patch management, and asset management for all of NCI  This package will satisfy the deficiencies identified by the OIG; specifically effective centralized patch management.  Additionally, it will resolve the issues associated with our existing application deployment process and the removal of administrative rights from the local workstations.</p>
<p>LANrev is the only known software provider that provides multi-platform software distribution, license management, patch management, remote management, asset inventory, TheftTrack, and role-based administration for both the Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh platforms.  Its ability to support Macintosh desktops is critical to NCI's management of its software and hardware resources.  LANrev is the sole provider of LANrev Site Licenses and Site License Maintenance.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<SUBJECT>Urinary Sugars Biomarker
<SOLNBR>NCI-80153-NG
<RESPDATE>081408
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Urinary Sugars biomarker in the OPEN study urinary samples with Quotient BioResearch, Newmarket Road, Fordham, Cambridgeshire, CB7 5WW, United Kingdom.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12M.

This requirement is based on the need to generate data on the urinary sugars biomarker.  The role of dietary sugars in cancer occurrence is largely inconclusive due to unreliability of self- reported intake estimates of sugars.  Sugars are major contributors to energy intake; however, their intake is difficult to measure as foods high in sugars are often underreported.  Recently, a new dietary biomarker has been developed to assess the validity of self-reported sugars intake.  In two metabolic studies under strictly controlled conditions, we found that the amount of sucrose and fructose in 24-hour urine collections was highly correlated to total sugars intake.  Results showed that 200 g of total sugars intake predicted about 100 mg of sucrose and fructose in urine. 

However, these findings were based on a small group of subjects; the next step is to investigate the performance of this biomarker in a larger study with free-living individuals in which dietary assessments have been validated with established biomarkers.

Specific Project: An NCI-based biomarker study, the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition (OPEN) Study, involved 484 men and women aged 40-69 years from Maryland.  The OPEN study collected dietary information using two self reporting dietary instruments- a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 24-hour dietary recall (24HR).  In addition, unbiased biomarkers of energy intake (doubly- labeled water) and protein intakes (24-hour urine nitrogen) were measured. The information on doubly-labeled water measurement is available form 93% of the participants and 77% of the collected 24-hour urines were verified for their completeness and analyzed for nitrogen. We propose to analyze sucrose and fructose in the urine collections and investigate how these relate to self-reported dietary sugars information as well as the doubly-labeled water and 24-hour urinary nitrogen biomarker measurements.  We will also use the regression equation from the metabolic study to estimate true intake based on the measured urinary values for sucrose and fructose. Creatinine in the urine collections will be measured to correct for urine concentration.

Contractor Requirements:  The Contractor shall perform the following: (1) nondestructively measure fructose and sucrose in human urine samples using the sequential enzymatic color assay on the Olympus AU640 automated chemistry analyzer. (2) Deliver the data to the NCI Project Officer in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months from date of award.  Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation.

Quotient BioResearch is the only source known to the NCI that has provided services to other research groups that measure sucrose and fructose in urine.  Market research did not identify any other laboratories that offer the service.  Quotient BioResearch has provided similar services to collaborative research groups measuring sucrose and fructose in urine in large epidemiological studies.  They are experienced with handling human samples and measuring various analytes and fulfill the NCI investigators requirements for study quality. The method of analyses, that QBR uses, has been validated against a reliable source.   Furthermore, Quotient BioResearch uses automated autoanalyser which is characterized by high precision and reproducibility and requires very small sample volume. The OPEN study is a biomarker-based study that provides two 24-hour urinary collections and measurements of two established dietary biomarkers for energy and protein, which are rather expensive and, thus, rarely done in studies with free-living individuals.  This study provides a unique opportunity to investigate the performance of a novel biomarker against the performance of already established biomarkers.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM ET, on August 15, 2008.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

The unit shall be complete and useable with all necessary equipment supplied to operate in the shop environment using 3-phase 460VAC and shop air of no greater than 3CFM at 120PSI as the only required utilities.  The CNC 3-Axis Rotary Draw Tube Bender (RDTB) system will be used to precision bend various tube materials for ships systems.  The minimum requirements for this RDTB system are: 1)	Size capacity to suit carbon steel and stainless steel tube material having an outside diameter from 3/8 to 4, 20 length, and wall thickness of 0.1342)	Capability to produce finished bends up to 180 while reducing the wall thickness of the tube no more than 20%, with centerline radius from 5/8 to 9-3/4a.	the working height must be a minimum of 54, providing clearance below the centerline of the die to allow clearance between the floor and bent tubeb.	the bed shall be of sufficient length to handle 20 long tubes, and positioning of the entire tube length over the bend mandrel3)	CNC controller for motion control of a linear axis along the length of the tube, rotary positioning about the length of the tube with programmable rotational speed, and rotation of the bend arm.  These axes will provide for precise control of length between bends, the angle between bends, and the angle of the bend respectively, commonly referred to as Y, B, & C.  The CNC control shall provide automatic movement of the mandrel and clamping die slide during the bending cycle.  The CNC must accept both inch and metric data input in both Y-B-C, and X-Y-Z formats, allowing the operator to input bend data directly from drawings in either format.  The CNC shall accept input for the length of the pressure die, so that it can calculate the necessary motion to process successive partial bends, each not exceeding the length of the pressure die.  This feature will allow bending of arcs having lengths longer than standard pressure dies, eliminating the need for long pressure dies.  The CNC shall accept programs for up to 18 bends in a single tube. The CNC shall feature automatic reverse bend sequencing to produce right and left hand finished parts.  The CNC shall be capable of storing at least 100 part programs, and have a USB port for upload and download of such programs.  The CNC control shall have the ability to display a graphical simulation of all programmed motion so that the operator may verify the absence of tool collisions, and collisions between the bent portions of the tube and floor or bender machinery.  The CNC must accept input for correction of the bend angle to allow for spring back variances between tube material lots.   The CNC will provide automatic release of the tube prior to the last bend to prevent collision.  The CNC shall have on-board diagnostics to aid maintenance personnel.4)	Laterally adjustable bend head and clamp slide to control the centerline radius of the bend, with mountings for bend, pressure, clamping, and wiper dies.5)	Each die mounting will allow for all adjustments necessary to precisely align the dies with each other, and each must be adaptable to existing Pines dies.6)	Equipped with safety features and guarding satisfying all federal, state, and local regulations, and must include a feature providing for safe loading/unloading/adjustment of materials and tooling.7)	Unit shall be supplied with all tooling required to produce 6 centerline radius bends in 2 OD x 0.134 Wall thickness x 20 long 2-1/4% Chrome-Molybdenum Steel tube material including mandrel and rods, pressure die, bend die, clamp die, and collet or similar to grip tube OD on Y-axis.8)	Each motion axis may be powered either hydraulically or electrically.  9)	The bending arm shall be capable of at least 18,000 ft. lbs of torque, and have a swing radius not to exceed 40 to prevent interference with the surroundings.  The length forward of the spindle pivot point shall be no more than 10 to allow clearance for bent portions of the tube.  The bend arm shall be capable of rotating far enough in excess of 180 to allow for spring back of material resulting in a finished bend of 180.10)	Hydraulic system shall be provided with replaceable element filtration.11)	The carriage advancing the tube between bends or partial bends shall capable of a linear speed of at least 50 ft/min.  The rotational axis about the centerline of the tube shall be capable of at least 10 RPM, and the rotational axis for bending capable of at least 5 RPM.  There shall be a means to reduce the speed of all of these axes to prevent whipping of a long tube section.12)	The unit shall be accurate and repeatable within +/-0.005 on the linear axis and within +/-0.1 in both of the rotational axes.13)	Operator manual and Maintenance manuals including wiring diagrams shall be included.14)	Service Technician and/or Application Engineer support, of at least three full working days, to oversee final installation and provide operator and maintenance training at the installation site in Portsmouth, VA, and associated travel expenses shall be included.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Based on three dimensional models and technology demonstrations, development of these capabilities is completed or well under way.

The basic Period of Performance for this continuation effort shall not exceed 18 months from date of contract award and all options will be complete 30 months after contract award.  The terms of the contract require that the software delivered will not require proprietary tools for manipulation and will be government owned and royalty free to prevent future restrictions in modifications, updates and changes as needed by the government.  The contractor shall continue development of the SDV capability to provide basic navigation and maneuvering, ballast and trim functions, Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (OAS), bathymetry databases, power and signal distribution functions, pilot and copilot interaction, an instructor to operator station, dynamic object insertion, system failures, intercom, environmental effects, improved OAS, video and data recording, integration of the command-common database and integration into the command mission planning system.  The continued maturation of the IR Sensor Operator Station shall provide realistic IR modeling, use of the command-common database, increased targets, fire control officer coordination, extensive 3D views and after action playback, advanced mission editing capability and full integration of an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) crew station for use as a stand alone trainer or linked to the IR Sensor Operator trainer as needed.  Optional deliverables include IR Sensor Operator station modernization and concurrency; SDV full ship to shore transition, docking and dry docking operations, actual mission playback from telemetry, full environmental effects, A Remote Weapons System and Airborne Signals Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Station.

Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified.

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage.  The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load.  Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements.  A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping and/or by steel or nonmetallic strapping.  When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping.  As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load.

The correct email for the contracting officer is: Tim.Spencer@faa.gov________

The FAA, through the Office of Runway Safety, intends to enter into Funded Cooperative Agreements with users who agree to equip their aircraft with equipment which can display approved Airport Moving Maps or with equipment approved to provide aural situational awareness runway information to pilots.
The amount of funding awarded will be determined by the type of equipment being installed and the number of aircraft receiving the equipment and which airports and how often the proposer will be operating the equipped fleet.  In return for receiving federal funds the users will agree to equip their aircraft within a certain time frame and participate in the evaluation detailed in the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP).
Multiple awards are possible.  The FAA estimates the total of all awards will not exceed $5,000,000.00.  The FAA currently has $2 million available to award, but may award additional cooperative agreements as funding becomes available.

<DESC>1.  Policy.  In response to desires expressed by the user community, and in keeping with the agency's commitment to work with industry, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking information on products and capabilities to replace the Conference Control System (CCS) currently supporting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) operations.  Information sought under this request will be used to gain an understanding of marketplace availability of products and capabilities that meet FAA operational needs.  Although the Operational Conference System (OCS) implementation plans are still evolving, it is the agency's policy to provide industry with pertinent information early on.  Implementation is expected to begin before 2011.  The OCS is expected to support the projected needs for a high capacity telecommunications conferencing system through a ten (10) year lifecycle.  The RFI responses will serve as a means of learning what the market capabilities are and to gauge industry's level of interest in working with the FAA to provide switching products meeting the Command Center's operational environment needs.  In addition to comments on the OCS technical requirements and capabilities, industry input on the FAA's planned business approach for acquiring the OCS capability is strongly encouraged.  The FAA will continue to keep industry informed through future announcements.
	2.  Objectives.  The FAA intends to work with the communications equipment manufacturing and service industries to provide a communications capability to support current and future ATCSCC operations
	3.  Operational Concept. The Operational Conference System (OCS) will be high-capacity telecommunications conferencing system.  Air traffic control specialist (ATCS) at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) will use the OCS to coordinate with national and international and weather organizations to establish and maintain ad-hoc, meet-me, progressive, and preset telecommunications conferences.  The telecommunications conferences will be used to expedite the flow of air traffic and enhance the safety and integrity of the National Airspace System (NAS).  Air traffic control specialist (ATCS) will be able to quickly and easily initiate and manage simultaneous conferences.
  	The OCS will provide a telecommunications conferencing capability for simultaneous small and large scale predefined telephone conferences and contingency conferences initiated from the ATCSCC.  The duration of a conference is normally from five (5) to 100 minutes.  The host for a conference requires the capability to identify which incoming line is active and the capability to mute or disconnect individual lines without affecting the other conference participants.  There are normally less than 100 participants in planning conferences, however the OCS must be able to accommodate up to participants.
	The OCS will provide sophisticated connection, switching, and conferencing capabilities for voice communications supporting air traffic management coordination between FAA facilities, commercial air carriers and other associated organizations.  OCS will interface with existing interphone networks, consisting largely of government-furnished point-to-point and multi-unit dedicated lines.  The OCS will support multiple signaling/supervision interface requirements and provide complete dialing functions for local, long distance and international destinations.  The OCS will be fully consistent with current operational concepts of ATCSCC communications.  The ATCSCC System will duplicate the basic functions and features of current equipment, and will add new features for operators (air traffic control specialists and supervisors, and maintenance personnel).  It will be easy to operate, thus reducing training requirements and lowering the risk of communications-related errors.
	It is expected that new FAA systems should meet the requirements for On-Site Maintenance Monitoring capability, including, but not limited to, the reporting of all fault detection to the maintenance position, to the supervisory positions, to any remote maintenance terminals, to the maintenance logging function, and to remote alarms, as required.
	Four attachments can be downloaded at: http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm
	Telephonic requests will not be entertained.  Email comments or questions.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide:

There is a critical need to provide focused support of pipeline activities to assist in the advancement of potential topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP) products from discovery to initial clinical testing.  The objective of this contract is to provide a resource of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of TM/BP products into clinical testing for the prevention the sexual transmission of HIV.

The information from this market research will help the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE DAIDS, NIAID, WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.

 
BACKGROUND

Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP) interventions represent important strategies for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV.  With current global HIV infection estimates exceeding 33 million people, the development of safe, effective, and acceptable TM/BP products to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV could play a major role in world-wide reduction of the over 9,000 new HIV infections per day, and potentially save millions of lives.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has recognized that the development of safe, effective and acceptable TM/BP products as a priority in the development of approaches to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  In response to this priority, NIAID has developed a Topical Microbicide Strategic Plan http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/topical_microbicide_strategic_plan.pdf and is developing a similar plan for BP interventions. There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials.  This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means of addressing the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide.  

The development of sustainable pipelines for the discovery, development and implementation of TM/BP has suffered from limited pharmaceutical industry and private partnership participation, which has in turn resulted in delays in transitioning candidates from discovery to initial clinical testing.  The lack of clinical evidence for proof-of concept for safety and efficacy of both TM/BP products has resulted in further delays.  For TM, a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-sponsored Microbicide Development Strategy (MDS) http://www.microbicide.org/galleries/default-files/mds_final_10aug06.pdf has addressed these issues and provided a critical analysis of the topical microbicide field to identify and address critical gaps in development.  Two critical process gaps were identified in the MDS: (i) the ability to advance compounds through FDArequired testing and (ii) the need to identify surrogate markers and standardize processes for the identification and measurement of safety and efficacy parameters.  Similar gaps exist in the translation of BP products (i.e. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, PrEP) to clinical testing.  There is a critical need to provide focused support of pipeline activities to assist in the advancement of potential TM/BP products from discovery to initial clinical testing.  

The objective of this contract is to provide a resource of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of TM/BP products into clinical testing for the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV.  Three (3) main areas of support are designed to achieve this objective:

1.  Pre-clinical and non-clinical specific gap-filling services to advance the development of non-vaccine prevention strategies 

2.  Comprehensive pre-clinical and non-clinical services for advancing selected TM/BP products to initial clinical testing via Product Development Plans containing milestones, timelines, and Go/No Go decision points for completion of each milestone 

3.  Best Practices Working Groups (BPWG) to identify critical parameters for the standardization of TM/BP discovery and development assays, leading to the identification and development of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy

Achieving the objectives of the contract will require the Contractor to provide a broad range of activities that encompass many of the current standard development approaches and regulatory standards for testing and development of TM/BP products.  The Contractor will be required to either directly or indirectly, through subcontracting, provide a wide range of pre-clinical and non-clinical support services for the advancement of TM/BP products from discovery to filing of Investigational New Drug (IND), Investigational Device Evaluation (IDE) and/or New Device Exception (NDE) applications with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Contractor must be versant in the existing methodologies and processes used to discover and advance products in the TM/BP pipelines.

SCOPE:

This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND, IDA and NDE applications to the FDA.  TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources.  The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA.  The Contractor shall carry out activities only upon approval by the Project Officer.

The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include:
 
(1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment 

(2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner 

(3) Support for BPWGs composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies.  This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials.

This contract will include an option to add additional BPWGs up to a total of 4 BPWGs during the period of contract performance that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  

NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all of the pre-clinical and non-clinical services and support activities set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and resources of subcontractors and specialized consultants to provide the full spectrum of requested activities.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed under this contract including that performed by any subcontractors and consultants, and coordination of non-contract investigators in the BPWGs.  The Contractor will ensure that any and all processes meet international, federal, local and state regulations to ensure the continuity and validity of the resulting product.  

Interested contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their companys experience and ability to perform this effort which includes the following: (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; (3) resumes for proposed key personnel, including the Project Director, which reflect education, and previous work relevant to the proposed requirement; (4) a general description of the facilities and other resources needed to perform the work; and (5) demonstrated ability to carry out the work.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey seeks information to determine if there is interest by one or more commercial or non-profit vendors in offering Landsat products beyond those available from the US Geological Survey (USGS).  The USGS has available Landsat TM and ETM+ data in a raw, uncorrected format (Level-0R) so that these data could be processed to user specifications (projection, datum, and resampling method).
By February 2009, the USGS will no longer offer any customer-specified Landsat products for sale.  Landsat scenes processed in a single, standard-product format will be available for user search, selection, and electronic retrieval at no charge via the Internet.  These standard products will be derived from newly captured imagery and from the entire USGS Landsat archive.  
The USGS now seeks information on industry capabilities, products, services and potential sources and requests that interested vendors provide a written response providing the information requested in the Request for Information (RFI) which is located at http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/acq_opp/RFI-Landsat0R.doc.
Vendors are encouraged to forward any questions in writing to Lynda L. McCarthy, Contract Specialist, at lmccarthy@usgs.gov by 2:00pm, EDT, August 19, 2008.   Vendors are required to word questions in such a way that the entire question can be publicized without concerns of releasing confidential or proprietary information.  Questions and answers will be publicly posted through an amendment to this announcement.  Responses are due by 2:00pm, EDT, September 12, 2008.  They can be emailed to lmccarthy@usgs.gov or if the file is large, mail to US Geological Survey, Acquisition Branch, MS205, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 20192, Attn:  Lynda McCarthy.   
DISCLAIMER:  THE RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) 15.201(e), RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT.  RESPONDENTS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI.  RESPONDENTS NEEDING CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THEY FURNISH MUST COMPLY WITH THE USGS's CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REGULATIONS, 17 C.F.R. 200.83 (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROCEDURES UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT).  RESPONSES TO THIS RFI WILL NOT BE RETURNED.  RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULT OF THE REVIEW.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice / Draft Request for Proposals is for informational purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS.<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests manufacturers of diesel fired, electrical power generators to provide notice of capacity to manufacture and sell commercially, 2500KW generators that are certified by the generator manufacturer to meet EPA Tier II (or better) emission requirements. Further details below.  <BR><BR>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate design and acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this announcement, the Government will utilize this information to direct its future design efforts. No separate solicitation will be produced for the sole purpose of acquiring said generators; however future construction contracts may require generators to be purchased that meet the said requirements. <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. <BR><BR>All interested manufacturers who respond with a commitment to meet requirements, and provided the Government chooses to mandate use of this particular design feature, will have their contact information passed to future construction contractors (hired under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District) for construction projects that utilize these particular requirements. This notice is to assist the Baltimore District, Corps of Engineers in determining potential sources and to obtain industry comment on a possible acquisition decision. This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. This sources sought is intended solely to obtain information, and at no time is the Government required to award, solicit, procure or show any preference toward any manufacturers or product. <BR><BR>Point of Contact Comments are to be sent either via email to edward.w.hall@usace.army.mil or by hard copy to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 10 S. Howard Street, Suite 7000, Baltimore MD 21201-1715 no later than 03:00 p.m. eastern standard time August 29th, 2008. The technical POC (where questions related to clarifying technical issues about this document can be directed) is Ms. Justina Nesbitt, reachable via email at Justina.t.Nesbitt@usace.army.mil<BR>NO APPOINTMENTS OR TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. <BR><BR>Product Description<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District has plans to construct a project, beginning in 2009, utilizing approximately three (3) 2500KW generators that meet EPA Tier II certification. The Government is interested in finding out what manufacturers will have available generators that meet these requirements. Note that the government is only looking for manufacturers (not vendors or retailers) to respond who currently, or can assure that they will by 2011, produce generators that meet these requirements and below specifications. Manufacturers must be willing to certify that they meet these standards with a product that will be sold commercially with regular availability; in other words, special order equipment that will have a premium price markup (above 20% over manufacturers comparable non-Tier II equipment) for the Tier II certification is not acceptable. In order to claim certification, the manufacturer must meet any and all requirements (if any) by EPA or other appropriate agency for affixing the Tier II certification label. For example, if the EPA requires that manufacturers send test data to them for validation prior to advertising Tier II compliant, than this must be done prior to our purchase. <BR>Due to the size and weight of the equipment, the manufacturer must vend, through their own sales staff or other authorized sales persons, their generators to the Greater Washington DC/ Baltimore MD area.<BR>Since the Tier II certification is relatively new, the Government will accept the manufacturers good faith statement that they will meet the Tier II requirements and have on the market the generators by mid 2011. Manufacturers please refrain from making any such claims if you are not absolutely sure you will meet the requirements by the said date.<BR>This product is exempt from the Buy American Act, thus international manufacturers are welcome to respond. Note that they must be able to vend as noted above.<BR>Any manufacturers who respond must have been manufacturing generators of similar size and performance (though not necessarily Tier II) for at least three (3) years and have a good track record of performance, and be able to show that their products have been used successfully in the commercial/industrial environment for at least three (3) years.<BR>Each component manufacturer for the diesel generator shall have a minimum of 3 years experience in the manufacture, assembly and sale of components used with stationary diesel engine-generator sets for commercial and industrial use. The engine-generator set manufacturer/assembler shall have a minimum of 3 years experience in the manufacture, assembly and sale of stationary diesel engine-generator sets for commercial and industrial use.<BR><BR>All manufacturers who respond please provide the government with the following:<BR>"	Statement of compliance with Tier II, or statement assuring future compliance by said date<BR>"	Documentation, if any, showing compliance with Tier II regulations and standards<BR>"	Statement of compliance with additional specs located below, and identify any areas of non-compliance with specs (other than Tier II) by clearly explaining non-compliance areas.<BR>"	Current price or target price<BR>"	Product cut sheet or specs, if available, or any available tentative information on the product if being developed<BR>"	Date available if currently being sold or tentative date of availability<BR>"	Estimated lead time on ordering<BR>"	Contact information<BR><BR><BR>Below represents specifications for generator.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) SN08-45: STATION KEEPING BUOY ENERGY HARVESTING/HARNESSING
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) Persistent Ocean Surveillance  Station Keeping program (POS-SK) is developing advanced concepts for a new tactical ocean surveillance buoy capable of extracting energy from the local environment for station keeping and long-term persistence.  

Based on program at-sea testing, two primary challenges for small station keeping buoys (SKBs) that require novel technologies and concepts are:  
	Maintaining a positive energy balance and operating for long periods of time on the open ocean.  Technologies that improve the SKB energy balance problem can be categorized as:  (1) technologies that more effectively enable the SKB to harvest / harness the available energy; (2) technologies that allow the SKB to operate more efficiently (use less energy); and (3) technologies that allow the SKB to store more energy.  
	Surviving high wind and high sea state conditions. Technologies that could improve the SKB operational survivability can be categorized as:  (1) technologies for short-term weather event survivability that could improve the chance of the SKB surviving extreme weather events that might otherwise damage or capsize the SKB; and (2) technologies for long term operational reliability.

DARPA desires to investigate component technologies that enable a positive energy balance over an extended period and can survive variable and extreme maritime environments; or system concepts with alternative energy harvesting technologies that maintain a positive energy balance, are robust enough to sustain  when ocean conditions are not favorable for an energy harvesting modality (limited solar radiation, no wind, or no waves), and can survive extreme environments.  SKB system attributes include:
	SKB endurance: minimum 4 weeks
	Station keeping watch circle: smallest possible while maintaining positive energy balance
	Operate up to Beaufort scale 6 (22  27 kts wind; 10 ft waves)
	Survive up to Beaufort scale 10 (48  55 kts wind; 30 ft waves)
	Size when stored:  Not greater than 1-foot diameter and 8.5 feet long)
	Ocean sensing at depths of 100-400 feet 
	
DARPA is interested in assessing new ideas and concepts in the above areas to support persistence ocean surveillance with station-keeping buoys in anticipation of future investments.  Technologies should represent a fundamental change vice incremental improvements over the status quo, based on an appropriate figure of merit.  Organizations are invited to submit a white paper (including 1 page with Executive Summary and Key Idea, 1-slide briefing chart with concept graphic, and 3-4 pages with supporting technical discussion) to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than 21 August 2008.  Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and development schedule estimates are also suggested.  

The government shall use the information provided by the white papers to determine the ultimate scope of the program.  White papers will not be returned and no feedback will be provided.  White papers should be marked with appropriate proprietary markings and will be maintained for review and then destroyed.   The information contained herein is for planning purposes and does not constitute an invitation for bids or a request for proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this notification or otherwise pay for the information provided.

The government is contemplating holding a workshop to present the progress to date on the current program and provide an opportunity for participants to present technologies that may potentially contribute to addressing the challenges expressed in this RFI.  Please indicate in your response if you might be interested in participating in a workshop.

<DESC>The American Embassy Manila, Philippines intends to standardize on General Motor passenger and non-passenger vehicles in order to carry out its mission.  This is in the best interests of the U.S. Government as there is a continuing need to repair and replace vehicles. It is more cost effective to maintain one brand of vehicles for the following reasons:


1.  Currently the post fleet consists of one hundred (100) vehicles.  Among them vans, sedans and sport utility vehicles.  Sixty percent of post fleet is General Motors.  There is a continuing need to replace vehicles that are unserviceable or uneconomical to maintain or operate.


2.  The Embassy has standardized on General Motors passenger and non-passenger vehicles since 1984 and has recommended renewal of standardization.  Services and parts for General Motors vehicles are available locally.  Manila also has in-house mechanics with years of experience on General Motors vehicles.


3.  The practicality of maintaining a stock of parts for a specific make of vehicle is desirable as well as cost effective.  Other positive results from standardization include the ability to interchange parts in emergency situations as well as maintaining requirements for equipment to a minimum.


4.  Post also consider that having a larger number of vehicles of the same make and model would be advantageous when meeting requirements for vehicle armoring.


This announcement is for informational purposes only; it is not a request for proposals or quotations. Interested firms may email capability statements to the point of contact identified below. Capability statements are due by the response date stated in this announcement.

<DESC>The American Embassy Manila, Philippines intends to standardize on Whirlpool appliances in order to carry out its mission. This is in the best interests of the U.S. Government as there is a continuing need to repair and replace vehicles. It is more cost effective to maintain one brand of vehicles for the following reasons:

1.  An on-going requirement to provide household appliances for Government owned and leased properties.  There is a continuing need to replace and/or repair appliances which are unserviceable or uneconomical to maintain and operate.


2.  The embassy has standardized on Whirlpool for major household appliances except water heaters since 1990 and recommends the continuation of this standardization.


3.  The practicality that standardization provides for cannibalization and interchangeability of parts between the same make of appliance alleviates disruption to post operations.


4.  Maintenance procedures will be improved and training costs reduced by standardizing on only Whirlpool appliances.  It is not practical for Manila to hire and train maintenance personnel capable of maintaining to any degree of acceptance several makes of household appliances.


5.  Potential for mechanical breakdowns will be minimized and long delays avoided affecting repairs if we can continue to utilize or $43,228.73 worth of Whirlpool spare parts.  Regularly scheduled preventive maintenance will be possible if the current stock of spare parts is maintained, thereby reducing appliance downtime.


6.  Although mission capability is the posts overriding concern to standardize on these appliances, the benefits and/or cost savings anticipated from this standardization will equal or exceed the savings that could be expected from full and open competition with different manufacturers.

<DESC>The purpose of this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION is to determine if there are suppliers that can satisfy the governments request as follows.  As part of its pre-solicitation effort for an RDT&E contract to develop and test a Mission Payload Model - Non-Lethal Weapons System (MPM-NLWS), the Marine Corps is seeking information on thermobaric payloads for the (non-lethal) incapacitation of targets at ranges of 30 to 150 meters.  The Marine Corps has a mission to force belligerent personnel to vacate an area or to temporarily deny their efforts to disrupt friendly operations. Target effect studies have identified the thermobaric payload as the preferred non-lethal stimuli to produce the desired incapacitation effects within the stringent limits of risk of permanent injury to the targets.  The Marine Corps is seeking available solutions or design concepts from industry for incorporating a non-lethal thermobaric payload into a tube-launched munitions delivery system that can be mounted on a HMMWV or its replacement vehicle and employed by a rapidly moving security force.  The munitions should be fully capable of being stored and operated in hot, basic, and cold temperatures and rugged enough to withstand being used by Marines during the rigors of moving through an urban environment in combat or threatening conditions.  It is requested that interested parties provide, at no cost to the Government, sales/marketing literature or test reports of any thermobaric munitions applicable to these requirements or capabilities to design and develop munitions to meet these requirements.  The Government is completing its Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase contract that will be released to industry in 2nd Quarter Fiscal Year 2009.  Respondents will be invited to a Government Industry Day during 1st Quarter Fiscal Year 09 to discuss the Governments requirements.  The Government intends to initiate an acquisition program to select a proposed MPM-NLWS design (launcher and munitions) from industry, to test and evaluate the proposed system, and to initiate a procurement effort.  Responses should be submitted no later than 31 August 2008.  THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL(RFP).  NO PROPOSALS are requested or will be accepted under this RFI and no award will be made for this effort at this time.  Therefore, this solicitation for information should not be construed as a commitment to procure the munitions and the Marine Corps does not intend to pay for any product samples or information provided by this announcement.  However, information obtained may be used for subsequent requests for proposals.  Any data that is of a proprietary nature should be marked as such.  Questions and responses should be directed to the contact person listed below at Commanding General, Attn: CTQ-Larry Hubbard, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-5010.  Federal Express Address:  2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-5010.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-24. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423450 with a small business size standard of 100 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and only qualified offerors may submit bids.

  1 to 25 gram sample volume
  Three speeds - 860, 1,700 and 3,700 rpm
  All steel construction
  Removable safety glass plate permits viewing of sample during milling and allows easy access to interior for cleaning
  As suggested by the U.S. Bureau of Plant Industry for milling of samples
With polished chamber 40 mm diameter x 22 mm deep, two stationary blades and a rotor with four cutting edges that revolve at high speed to produce a shearing action which minimizes loss of moisture from heat. Produces a 20-gram, 40-mesh sample of dried plant stem tissue in 15 to 20 minutes; a similar sample of extracted leaf tissue in 7 to 10 minutes; or 13 mm pieces of soybean stems in 5 to 7 minutes. Dried samples are generally used, but tobacco with 12% moisture has been milled satisfactorily.
Samples introduced through the hopper are swept around by rotor until cut to sufficient fineness to pass through sieve top of delivery tube which forms the bottom of the chamber. Six interchangeable delivery tubes of varying mesh are available. The 80 mesh size lacks ruggedness for general use but has been found convenient for plant tissue which has first passed the coarser screens.

Samples can be stored in the same jar. Small samples are collected in a receiver 22 mm square x 19 mm deep.

Mini-Mills are supplied with: 2.5" diameter stainless steel hopper with cover; wooden plunger; three delivery tubes with Monel metal sieve tops of 20, 40 and 60-mesh (other sizes available), each with receiver; two extra tool steel stationary blades; two Allen wrenches; extra 3383N55 glass front plate; 3383N65 Adapter; three 4 oz. screw cap glass jars; brush.

Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared
in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13.

       
               This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are
being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The
North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS is 541380).  This is a
small business set-aside.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED AND
ONLY SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS MAY SUBMIT A QUOTE.

The NIST Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement
for comprehensive testing services for elemental analysis and chemical
properties of portland cement and blended portland cement in accordance
with the following Performance Work Statement (PWS):



--BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT-----------

Performance Work Statement
Testing of Cement Candidate Materials for SRM Certification


1.	Background

The Analytical Chemistry Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology develops, critically evaluates, and applies techniques for the identification and measurement of inorganic species using several analytical methods.  This mission includes development and continued certification of standard reference materials (SRMs), which are used by many government agencies and private and industrial companies.  

2.	Applicable Documents

ASTM C 114-05, Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Hydraulic Cement

3.	Scope of Work

The Contractor shall provide comprehensive testing services for elemental analysis and chemical properties of Portland cement and blended Portland cement in accordance with ASTM C 114-05.  

NIST requires that all work listed in section four of this performance work statement (PWS) be completed by a single facility because the successful completion of some tests depends on the successful completion of other tests in the same laboratory with all specimens for all test methods coming from the same unit of material.


4.	Specific Tasks and Associated Performance Standards (maybe part of the Scope of Work)

The Contractor shall perform the following services on materials supplied by NIST in accordance with ASTM C 114-05.  All tests shall be performed on duplicate specimens from each six (6) vials of SRM 1880b candidate cement and one (1) vial of cement designated as a quality assurance material

1. Total Ca as CaO, ASTM C 114 gravimetric method
2. Total Si as SiO2, ASTM C 114 gravimetric method
3. Total S as SO3, ASTM C 114 gravimetric method
4. Total P as P2O5, ASTM C 114 UV/Vis method
5. Total Na, Mg, Al, K, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Sr by atomic absorption spectrometry
6. Cl as chloride, ASTM C 114 method
7. Free lime, ASTM C 114 method
8. X-ray fluorescence analysis (meeting C 114 qualification for rapid methods) with borate fusion sample preparation for Total Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn.
9. Insoluble Residue, ASTM C 114 method
10. F as fluoride by ion selective electrode method
11. Sulfide sulfur, ASTM C 114 method or equivalent
12. Loss on ignition at 950 &#61616;C, ASTM C 114 method

5.	Deliverables and Reports, and Associated Due Dates

Each of the twelve tests in section 3 of this contract shall be documented in a complete report of analysis.  The report shall include estimates of uncertainty due to measurement repeatability.  The report shall be completed within 90 days of receipt of samples by the laboratory.  An extension of time will be available, but only if requested by the laboratory at least two weeks prior to the expiration of the 90-day period or if NIST chooses to request work on a subsequent cement SRM during the 90-day period.

The minimum requirements for reports of analysis for cement SRM analyses are as follows:

a.	Complete identification of organization running laboratory including name, location, shipping address, laboratory manager(s) responsible for personnel performing testing.
b.	Unique project identifier code.
c.	Dates samples received and notation of any damage or suspicious circumstances.
d.	Dates during which analyses and data evaluation were performed.
e.	Summary sheet itemizing mean results for each constituent and property determined by all test methods employed.
f.	Individual sheets for each test method listing all individual test results, preferably in the order measurements were made.  Sheet will also include
1)	Identification of analyst(s) for every result and approving/reviewing official.
2)	Each individual result will be identified by the container code number assigned by NIST plus an index letter or number.
3)	Quantity of specimen used for each measurement.
4)	Individual result values given with at least three significant digits, if possible.  Results having just one digit are not acceptable.  
5)	Mean and standard deviation of all replicate results for each constituent.  Optimally, the uncertainty will be expressed with two significant digits and the individual results will be reported to the same number of decimal places.
6)	Reference to quality system identification of test method.
7)	Indication of standard test method, if any, to which the test method conforms (ASTM C 114 in most cases).
8)	Individual results for quality assurance samples will be included on each of these sheets.
9)	As an option, these report sheets may also include key intermediate quantities/values obtained in the process of sample preparation and analysis, if the analyst deems them of potential value as quality indicators.  Solution volumes and densities are good examples because they impact the uncertainty budget.
g.	Brief descriptions of all test methods with key operating conditions.  Examples include borate fusion conditions, reagents, and identification of instrumentation used including brand and model number.
h.	For relative test methods, calibration standards shall be listed including the producing organization and that organizations catalog number.  For balances, the laboratory shall identify their standard weights set(s).

6.	Options

NIST may award up to ten options to repeat the work specified in section three of this performance work statement (PWS) for a new cement SRM.  

7.	Period of Performance and Location Work is to be performed

One year from award of this contract plus up to four additional years for options.  All work shall be performed at the Contractors facility.

8.	Government-Furnished Property, Data, and Information

NIST will provide the Contractor with all SRM and quality assurance materials within 30 days from the award of the contract or an option.

9.	Exhibits and Attachments

None

10.	Summary of Performance Requirements 

Required Output	Required Service	Performance Standard	Monitoring Method
Report of analysis of candidate SRM samples and quality assurance samples	Analysis of cement SRMs  and quality assurance samples in accordance with ASTM C 114-05	Compliance with analytical method requirements in this PWS.	The Technical Information Contact will review the Contractors reports, request raw data to verify calculations, and may request other records specified in the Contractors quality control system.

11.	Contractor Qualifications

The Contractor shall have at least five years experience with the analytical methods specified in section 3 of this contract.  The Contractor shall also be ISO 17025 accredited for the methods in section 3 of this contract.

12.	Evaluation Factors

The Government may award a contract to the Contractor whose quotation is deemed to represent the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors will be used to evaluate quotations.  Technical factors will be significantly more important than price. Technical ranking factors will be evaluated as good, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. 

A.  Personnel Qualifications of Proposed Key Personnel

The Contractors proposal must show compliance with the requirements set forth in section ten of this PWS.  Of particular importance is ISO 17025 accreditation for the methods listed in section three of this PWS.

<DESC><p>Notice of Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new NCI Initiative: The Chemical Biology Consortium
<p>The Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) is a new program being developed by NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), in conjunction with the NCI Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the NCI Office of the Director (OD) to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat cancer. CBC Participants will partner with various programs within DCTD, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap, and CCR to establish an iterative drug discovery group on the scale of a small biotechnology concern with the mission of focusing on therapeutic needs in oncology not currently addressed by the private sector. The long-term vision of the CBC is to bridge the gap between basic scientific findings and NCI-supported clinical research, and in the process to re-establish the NCI as a leader in the area of innovative cancer therapeutics discovery.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that the scientific expertise and novel technologies assembled within the CBC will expedite the movement of promising new molecules through NCI's drug discovery pipeline and into first-in-human clinical trials to be performed under NCI sponsorship. Only compounds which meet strict milestones/stage gate criteria will advance into the clinical setting, thus focusing clinical resources on the most promising agents.</p>
<p>The NCI, through its Operations and Technical Support Prime Contractor SAIC-Frederick, Inc., is seeking the services of a contract research organization (CRO) which specializes in chemistry to assist in moving compounds through the CBC pipeline in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
<p>There may be multiple awards.&nbsp; Subcontractor place of performance is not limited to the United States.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NFFKPR00-8-43280 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is set aside for Small Business. The associated NAICS code and small business size standard is 541990 and $6.5M. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Marine Mammal Conservation Division to conduct Sea Turtle Stranding Network surveys at the Principal Nesting Beaches of the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle in Tamaulipas, Mexcio. In the U.S., an active and organized sea turtle stranding network has been developed and continues to be improved in order to quantify the seasonality, species composition, stock structure, life history stage, sex ratio, and distribution of turtles that wash ashore dead or alive. The stranding network endeavors to identify both anthropogenic and natural casual factors of mortality with the hope of identifying mortality factors and implementing sound management and conservation measures. Due to its endangered status, strandings involving the Kemp's Ridley, Lepidochelys kempii receive a great deal of attention from federal regulatory agencies charged with enforcing the Endangered Species Act as well as fishing industry interest whose fishing activities may be affected by management actions. The epicenter of Kemp's Ridley sea turtle nesting is located between La Pesca, in the state of Tamaulipas and Lechuguillas, in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Stranding data collected in Mexico from 2001 to the early part of 2008 have shown that significant strandings are occurring, both during the nesting season and throughout the remainder of the year. Stranding data are a source of important information relative to population structure as well as mortality factors operating on the population. The specified work will facilitate the continuation of stranding surveys on the Tamaulipas, Mexico coastline to document mortality and to evaluate potential causative factors. More data are needed to understand the level of sea turtle strandings and to evaluate the trend(s) in strandings. Prior to the initiation of stranding sueveys in Mexico in 2001, data in Mexico were anecdotal at best and were only recorded during the months of nesting activity at the principal nesting beaches, and then, only when time permitted. Mexico implements a shrimp closure which coincides with the Kemp's Ridley nesting season so that this period likely represents low levels of sea turtle strandings. Objectives: Conduct year-round, sea turtle stranding surveys along the Tamaulipas coastline of Mexico. Ensure that accurate location and detailed stranding data are collected for each documented stranding. Enhance knowledge of mortality factors on the population through thorough documentation and reporting of results, including necropsy data as practicable. Tasks: 1). Conduct patrols three times/week from the Tepehuajes, Rancho Nuevo, Barra del Tordo, Altamira and La Pesca camps. These patrols will cover the prime sectors of the Kimp Ridley's habitat. This work will be accomplished during the period of September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009; 2). Locate patrol leaders permanently at each of the five field camps and patrol leaders are responsible for security at each of the camps to prevent vandalism which translates into annual savings to the program; 3). Collect GPS location data for each stranding location, as well as detailed biological information on each stranded turtle that includes checking for internal and external tags. Complete standardized reporting forms and archive data in a database for managing stranding data; 4). Perform necropsies on dead stranded sea turtles whenever practical and the cause(s) examined. Standardized necropsy forms will be used. Stranded sea turtles will be examined for external tags and scanned for the presence of PIT tags. Turtles will also be scanned for wire-coded tags when a magnetometer is available. Deliverables: A Progress Report of activities and results will be submitted by February 15, 2009 and a Final Project Report will be submitted by August 31, 2009. The progress report shall include quantitative data collected by the stranding network, including standard strandings form for each turtle encountered and all necropsy results in standard format. Summary tables shall be included that tabulate strandings by species by week by geographical areas in the standard format. The final report shall include complete results and analyses, including maps of the locations of the standings and results of PIT tag and wire-coded tag scanning. The resulting purchase order shall be awarded on a best value basis and will be firm fixed price. Period of Performance: September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2009. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price. The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Outstanding (O) - Conspicuously striking in eminence; Good (G) - Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Adequate (A) - Reasonably sufficient and suitable; Marginal (M) - Minimally suitable at the lower limit.

<CONTACT>Kim E McCray, Phone 202-693-4570, Email mccray.kim@dol.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to secure the services of highly-skilled independent evaluators to conduct mid-term and final evaluation of OCFT-funded international child labor technical cooperation projects.  The Offeror will be required to provide a continuum of services from the initiation of the evaluations to the production of final reports for distribution.

The contractor will provide highly skilled, independent evaluators to conduct project evaluations to: a) determine if projects are achieving their stated objectives and explain why or why not, b) identify areas of good practices and where project implementation can be improved; c) assess the impact of the projects in term of sustained improvements achieved, d) provide recommendations on how to improve project performance, and e) identify lessons learned to inform future projects. The findings of the evaluations should assist OCFT in its efforts to improve project oversight and take corrective measures as necessary.  

The evaluation services to be performed under this contract shall include the following:

a.	Recruit Evaluator and in-country evaluation and/or support personnel, as needed.  Resumes of a minimum of 3 evaluator candidates should be sent to OCFT for review and writing samples and references should be checked.
b.	Arrange for a pre-evaluation briefing of evaluator by OCFT project managers.
c.	Consult with OCFT and project staff to determine most appropriate methodology to be used to answer the evaluation research questions and present findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
d.	Finalize evaluation Terms of Reference (TOR), after discussions with OCFT and project staff and evaluator.  A standard TOR will include questions relating to project design and implementation, partnership and coordination, management and budget, project sustainability, lessons learned, and good practices.  
e.	Jointly develop evaluation itinerary with evaluator, project staff, and OCFT.  The itinerary will be subject to final approval by OCFT prior to commencement of fieldwork.
f.	Perform all necessary logistical tasks for the evaluation, including travel arrangements, and, as necessary, recruit and sub-contract with in-country support (translator, driver, etc.).
g.	Conduct the evaluation, including a stakeholders meeting at the end of the field research, where the evaluator will present his/her preliminary findings, conclusions, and recommendations and seek stakeholder input.
h.	Write evaluation report addressing research questions included in the Terms of Reference and including findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
i.	Distribute draft report to grantee, OCFT, and key stakeholders, for review and comment. 
j.	Finalizing evaluation report, incorporating comments received from grantees, OCFT, and key stakeholders.

Individual Task Orders to be issued under this contract will contain additional detailed information relating to the projects to be evaluated and other deliverables, such as a summary report, that might be required.


The Contractor(s) will provide all logistical and administrative support for its/their staff and sub-contractors, including travel arrangements (e.g., plane and hotel reservations, purchasing plane tickets, providing per diem), all materials (e.g., access to computers, telecommunications, office supplies) and services (e.g. local translators, translation of draft reports if they are written in a language other than English) needed to provide all deliverables.  The Contractor(s) will also be responsible for providing the management and technical oversight necessary to ensure consistency of methods and technical standards.  ILAB/OCFT will provide information on each projects geographical target areas to allow for more sound evaluation methodology.  Most projects have funds allocated for external evaluations in their budgets.  In such cases, project funds should be used for costs associated with the evaluators in-country transportation (including vehicle, gasoline, and driver costs), translation of the evaluation report from English to the local language for dissemination to key stakeholders, and stakeholders meeting expenses (included participant support costs, local transportation, and translation) as budgets permit.  When projects do not have funds allocated for external evaluations, or have limited funds, the Contractor(s) will assume the costs that cannot be covered by the project.  

DELIVERABLES

The Contractor will be provided with a Schedule of Deliverables and other additional instructions as needed for each individual Task Order to be issued under this contract.  
The deliverables will normally include an initial workplan, a quality control plan, individual TORs and itineraries for each project evaluation, a draft evaluation report in a format prescribed by OCFT, and a final evaluation report, to be approved by OCFT prior to final payment.  Task Orders may also require a summary report.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) are established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows] (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 08 August 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 05 August 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6713. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR BDOT ANDDDOT SENSORS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to add a maximum acceptable delivery time of 60 daysafter receipt of order, respond to a question from a vendor, and notify offerors that theRFQS system will not be utilized for this requirement (All quotes shall be sent viae-mail to rob.wolfinger@nasa.gov by 3pm local time on August 12, 2008).Question/Answer:Q.1.  "The B-Dot and D-Dot free field sensors specify a 100 microsecond passiveintegrator to be supplied.  Passive integrators accept a 50 ohm compatible input andrequire connection to a high impedance (greater than 1 Mohm) connection at the output. Normally, this integrator is attached directly to the input of an oscilloscope which canprovide a 1 Mohm termination.  This means that the output of the Balun (which isconnected directly to the Sensor) will be connected to the input of the passiveintegrator using a coaxial cable.  Is this the configuration desired?  Also, for theD-Dot Ground Plane sensor, please specify Axial or Radial version."A.1.  The B-dot sensors are the ones that require a Balun and a passive integrator. Thesensor is connected to the balun, the balun is connected to the integrator (using acoax), and the output of the integrator goes into a high impedance scope.  We want the axial version of the D-dot ground plane sensor.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on July 29, 2008.

Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust and chads must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and, 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality. If the paper fails to meet these criteria during that period, SSA reserves the right to cancel the order. The contractor shall be responsible for any roll that cannot be used within 10 inches of the core, or for which the core does not function properly, at no additional charge to the Government.

2. Where can the answers to the questions be accessed?

Response: The answers will be posted on FedBizOps. See the link:

https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS/USCG/GACS/HSCG23-08-R-MNQ023/listing.html

3. On Page 6 of the Solicitation guidelines about PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. Volume II is specified twice. Should it read, please submit: of one original and five copies for Volume I and one original and one copy for Volume II?

Response: Yes. This guideline has been changed to read as follows and is incorporated into the solicitation:

Please submit: (1) One original and five copies of Volume I. (2) One original and one copy of Volume II.

4. Theres an attached Scenario worksheet for SPCAIR. Is this for use with the proposal? If so, how is it to be used?

Response: Yes. The sheet is to be used as a guideline to create your price proposal. The sheet should contain all the items listed in the CLINs and could be further broken down as the vendor sees fit. Please note that there must be a Total Price for each ordering period and a Grand Total for five years.

5. Is it possible to see a sample of a government RFP (Proposal) for small craft?

Response: No sample exists. You are free to submit the proposal as you see fit as long as each requirement in the Solicitation, Attachments A and B are addressed sequentially as the solicitation states. Please refer back to pages 5 and 6, INSTRUCTION FOR PROPOSAL CONTENT and PROPOSAL PAGE LIMIT for guidance.

6. In 070-3.1 says theres potential seating for 7, but nothing is specified about gurneys? Will these be needed?

Response: Since the specification does not mention gurneys, then they will not be required. They may be included in your proposal if desired.

7. Under 083-2 LOGISTICS CONFERENCE it states in 083-2.1 that the contractor shall provide facilities for a logistics conference for 10 govt. personnel. What does this mean? Does it mean that our production facility should be big enough to seat 10 officials and be able to discuss things? Its for 2 days, but how long is the conference suppose to run on each given day? Is that up to us? What items are we required to have on the agenda? Does the same apply for 083-2.2? Is anything pertaining to this conference due with the RFP is it to be submitted after the conference? Whats considered Logistic?

Response:  The intent of this requirement in the specification is to inform the vendor that the Coast Guard will hold a PTD Conference.  The Coast Guard may have up to 10 people in attendance.  The conference is typically held over two eight hour days.  Agenda items will be discussed at the post award conference here at our Headquarters in Washington, DC.  We will discuss the deliverables, what the contractor shall provide, at the PTD Conference.   

Logistics is anything pertaining to support of the platform after delivery to the field.  The Coast Guard will use the documentation provided by the successful vendor to determine sparing levels, maintenance requirements and life cycle costs.

8. 083-3 Master Equipment List. In section 083-3.5 it list at minimum what the MEL should include. I found an example chart that NASA used on the internet, is this the format to use for the MEL? Are all the minimum listings suppose to be in the MEL?

Response: The NASA example is not the format we will require to be used.  Typically the MEL includes parts/components used to put the boat together.  The minimum listing will be discussed in detail at the PTD Conference.

9. In 151-2.1 about CABIN ENCLOSURE it states that the SPC-AIR shall be outfitted and arranged with a semi enclosed or fully enclosed cabin. It defines Semi Enclosed but not fully enclosed. Does this mean the contractor also has the choice to make the cabin out of aluminum? In 151-2.2 explain what you mean by heated tempered safety glass?

Response:  The cabin may be made of aluminum.   

IRT heated tempered safety glass  We require the window to be tempered safety glass with a heating system for defrosting. 

10. In 602-2 MARKINGS Since the contractor is required to Mark the boat, are these decals available for purchase or do we have to have them made?

Response: The decals can be purchased commercially.

INTRODUCTION<BR>PM J-AIT provides a single point of contact for procurement and technical expertise across the suite of AIT-enabling technologies.  This support is focused on Total Asset Visibility (TAV) and the integration of products within global supply chains.  PM J-AIT provides automated near real-time accurate data collection, aggregation, and retrieval that enhance information management systems and manages Radio Frequency In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) for DoD, NATO, and Coalition Partners in support of expeditionary logistics.<BR>As part of its mission, PM J-AIT evaluates and provides the latest in various types of hardware, software, and services from AIT industry leaders to the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies.  PM J-AIT also provides expertise in systems integration, AIT standards, and professional services to help customers meet requirements and develop customized AIT solutions. <BR>A significant part of PM J-AITs mission is met through the AIT-III contract.  Through this contract PM J-AIT provides hardware, software, and services to Government systems designers and integrators. The hardware provides a common baseline of bar code and micro-circuitry devices for both tactical and non-tactical applications.  Software includes commercially available operating systems, Bar Code Label and Form Design and Printing Software, Application Software Development Kits, Application Generation Software, and Wireless Transaction Support Software.  Services include maintenance, training, technical engineering services, and documentation.<BR>Specifically, AIT-III enables radio frequency data collection and automatic data capture using handheld that send and receive information by radio frequency.  Information from the units is displayed on a screen on the handheld terminal for workers. It also allows real-time, two-way exchange of data between terminals, fixed, mobile, and a host computer at a distant location allowing real-time operations in applications like warehousing, retail, and other process oriented industries.  Radio frequency data collection systems then communicate information from a mobile location to a host computer in real-time. <BR>The environment in which these devices operate can range from warehouse to field locations and must operate under a wide range of variable factors encompassing temperature, humidity, and shock.  The devices are used by a variety of personnel in secured and unsecured areas and are often attached to forklifts or other material handling equipment.  In warehouses, these AIT devices enable rapid information exchange for shipping, receiving, order picking, and stocking operations.<BR>B. PURPOSE <BR>The goal of this RFI is to gather information regarding industry experience and expert advice for the Government's needs as outlined in the Scope and in the questions below.  Industry responses will be used by the Government to refine the scope of the future requirement for the products and services described here. <BR>In reviewing the responses, the Government technical POC may request additional information via email only to gain further insight into the responders technical and manufacturing capabilities. No meetings or teleconferences will be held with the vendors.<BR><BR>Firms are requested to not include marketing informational material that does not relate to the products and services described in this RFI as it will be discarded by the reviewers. <BR><BR><BR>Key information requested:<BR>1.	The US Army requires portable/wearable labeling solutions for shipping and outdoor storage applications.  Currently these applications require 2-inch, 3-inch and 4-inch wide labels resistant to Ultra Violet light (thermal transfer).  The Government seeks sources and product specification sheets and Internet Web sites containing relevant information. <BR>2.	The Government seeks Industry comments on cross-contract integration and criteria by which task orders and prime contracting arrangements can be determined.  That is, the Government envisions the potential for integration of AIT with passive and active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) products that can be acquired from multiple PM J-AIT contract vehicles and multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).  The Government seeks Industrys views on Risk, Management, and Quality factors necessary to minimize the cost of integration.   <BR>3.

<DESC>Amendment A0004 is issued to provide a corrected BID SCHEDULE with regard to Note (5) concerning the "Daily Yard/Facility Service Charge/Fee." Unfortunately, this note has been incorrect since the issuance of Amendment A0001. The text currently is a virtual duplicate of that for Note (6) which is incorrect. The text for Note (5) should read and is changed as follows:

"Fixed Price Per Day: Represents a composite daily rate for pier, dry-dock, shop space and/or marine railway utilization, combined with costs for tool and equipment usage, security, fire protection, waste disposal, fuel storage (if required), utilities, shop consumables (not included in the Materials items), beginning on date of Contractor's acknowledgement of receipt of a Task Order for Phase II or the day following arrival into the Contractor's yard/facility (whichever is later) and continuing for each calendar day thereafter that the vessel is in the care/custody of the Contractor, until date prior to day of departure (after completion of actual repair/maintenance work); Daily rate includes associated profit for this item. This item is only applicable and payable if the principal place of performance is at the Contractor's repair facility/yard (or that of any sub-contractor)."

A revised page 7 and complete Excel version of the Bid Schedule are included.

In addition, this amendment provides for an updated Attachment 11 (pages 45-46 of the solicitation) which is consistent with text of Amendment A0003 with regard to Contractor's ability to charge and invoice for the "Daily Yard/Facility Service Charge/Fee" beginning on date of Contractor's acknowledgement of receipt of a Task Order for Phase II or the day following arrival into the Contractor's yard/facility (whichever is later) and continuing for each calendar day thereafter that the vessel is in the care/custody of the Contractor, until date prior to day of departure (after completion of actual repair/maintenance work). This change applies only in situations where the Contractor elects to perform the work at its own facility/shipyard (or that of a Sub-Contractor). A revised page 46 and complete Excel version of the Attachment are included.

The quotation due date/time remains Friday, 8/8/2008, 3:30pm. Dallas/Central time.

They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government.

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Adobe Acrobat 9.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/DO requires the purchase of Adobe Acrobat Professional 9.  
Adobe Acrobat Professional 9According to the vendor, Acrobat Professional 9 allows users to PDF (portable document format) documents that comply with a host of industry standards, including PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4 (draft), PDF/A, JDF, XMP metadata, and XMLoriginal. PDF documents can also be created from Microsoft Access, Excel, Internet Explorer, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Publisher, Visio, Word, and AutoDesk AutoCAD files. Text, tables, measurements, and embedded object data can be copied from other applications. Paper documents can be scanned to create searchable PDF documents. Layers in applications such as Visio or AutoCAD can be preserved in a PDF document. Headers, footers, watermarks, digital signatures, and access control can be added to any PDF document, and source documents of any format can be attached. Acrobat Professional 9 supports a variety of commenting tools, and both static and dynamic forms. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.            During the CCB evaluation process, it was determined that Adobe Professional 9 offers more integration between its components and with other applications than the previous version of Adobe Professional.It is difficult to impossible  to determine the costs needed to re-design/re-engineer work that is performed on Adobe 9, or earlier versions such as adobe 8 since there is no suitable competitor in the marketplace.CA/CST/DO believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The Pacific Northwest Forest &amp; Range Experiment Station, Olympia, Washington, intends to acquire by contract remodeling of the Olympia Forestry Sciences Laboratory by: (1) redesign of the reception area to provide security and manage visitors better; (2) enclose the breezeway between the main building and south wing to allow easier access to be environmentally friendly; and (3) convert existing loading dock to include office, hot and cold storage, and an ADA bathroom with shower.  The building is an attractive wood-framed, beveled-siding building with a mansard roof.  The new remodel will maintain and/or complement the look and feeling of the existing structure, utilizing widely available materials.
The government will proceed to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation, restricted to HubZone small business concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on price, experience, and past performance.  Contract award will be to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government. The government estimated price is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  
The project is located at the Pacific Northwest Forest &amp; Range Experiment Station, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, 3625 &ndash; 93rd Avenue S.W., Olympia, Washington.  On I-5, south of Olympia, take exit #99 to 93rd Avenue.  Head west one mile to the Olympia Laboratory.
The performance period is 240 calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed.
Performance and payment bonds are required for this project.  Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to this solicitation and any resulting contract.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on, or about, JULY 01, 2008.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.  For additional information contact Mr. Miley Sutherland, Contracting Officer at 360-956-2471.  Mr. Robert Avila, (360) 891-5271, is the Project Engineer.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for the renovation of existing cafeteria space into a conference center at the Harold Washington Social Security Center located at 600 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.  The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, with an anticipated project duration of approximately 10 months.  

The project scope consists of the demolition of existing kitchen and food service areas finishes, partitions, equipment, and remaining building systems as well as the construction of new metal stud and drywall partitions and both hard and lay-in ceilings. All of the mechanical, electrical, telecommunications/data, plumbing, and fire protection systems will be new and tie into the existing building systems.

The best value trade-off process will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.  The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price.  The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, past performance on similar projects, qualifications and experience of key personnel and project management plan.    

Small Business Participation:  In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.
