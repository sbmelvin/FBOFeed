<RESPDATE>100103
<ARCHDATE>11302003
<CONTACT>Charlene G. Jeong, 404-464-2517
<DESC>NA On 1 October 2002, the Army mandated the use of a group of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for the purchase of office products.  The primary goals of this BPA initiative were to ensure that office product purchases were in compliance with the statutory p references afforded to products manufactured under the Javits-Wagner-OÃ¢Â€Â™Day (JWOD) Act and to capture economies of scale.  The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation notice is to announce the new procurement of Army BPAs for office products and request feedb ack from those vendors and consortiums expressing interest. Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region Contracting Center intends to procure office products through the issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreements under GSA Federal Supply Schedules.  RFQ availability date is estimated 3 October 2003 via through GSA E-Buy.   The GSA E-Buy web address is http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/content/offerings_content.jsp?contentOID=116555&contentType=1004&P=1&S=1.  Interested vendors shall submit their quotes via electronic means in GSA E-Buy.  No hard copy quotes will be accepted.  Quot es from responsible offerors will be considered.  RFQ proposal submission date is estimated 3 December 2003.  No hard copy request for quotes (RFQ) will be made available.  An Industry Day Conference is anticipated for October 2003.  The Homepage Address f or all Army BPAs status/updates is:  www.forscom.army.mil/aacc.  All CONUS Army users are now required to purchase office products through the BPAs.  However, Army installations with an onsite self-service supply store may use this source to obtain JWOD of fice products.  To the maximum extent practicable, BPA purchases must be made through the DoD E-Mall at https://emall.prod.dodonline.net/scripts/emLogon.asp.   Army customers place orders using the Government-wide Purchase Card Vendors will be requested to submit quotes for office products that meet the criteria stated in the RFQ.  The vendor will be required to provide the following information in their RFQs: pricing information; capability and capacity data; past performance; a  willingness to accept minimum order qty of $25.00, possess a GSA contract, show certification as an authorized JWOD distributor, demonstrate E-Commerce capability by ability to transmit Level 3 data.  Level 3 data is an electronic posting to the cardholde r's billing statement simultaneously when the items are scanned and charged to the customerÃ¢Â€Â™s credit card.  It includes unit cost, quantities, unit of measure, product codes, product descriptions, ship to/from zip codes, freight amount, duty amount, o rder date, discount amount, and order number and other data elements as defined by the card associations or similar entity.  In order to avoid confusing Government cardholders, the BPA customers, the Army requires an order to be charged in total regardless  of whether partial shipments are made.  In order to maximize SB, we are seeking qualified small businesses, including consortiums and teams. The Army expects that vendors will offer additional pricing discounts beyond their GSA FSS pricing, demonstrate a willingness to provide shipment within 24 hrs. with 2-day delivery, and develop and offer a Customer Management Program.   One of the major goals of the Army Office Products BPAs is to leverage the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s buying power based on economies of scale.  The Army intends to award sufficient BPAs to ensure adequate participation by Small Business, adequate delivery coverage consi stent with the concept of Army-wide BPAs, achieve best value for BPA customer by considering additional discounts beyond GSA FSS pricing, compliance with the JWOD program and offer customer incentives such as the Customer Management Program . Award of the BPAs will be based by determining the Ã¢Â€ÂœBest ValueÃ¢Â€Â offerors, price and other factors considered.  Quote evaluations will be based on factors to be considered, in order of importance, Business Size, Pricing/Incentives/Customer Managem ent Pr ograms,  Past Performance and capability.  Vendors expressing interest are requested to respond via electronic mail to the attention of Charlene Jeong at jeongcg@forscom.army.mil.  No hard copy responses will be accepted.  Incoming responses shall contain Ã¢Â€ÂœBPA ResponseÃ¢Â€Â in SUBJECT line of e-mail.  Responses are due by 1 October 2003.

INTRODUCTION/SCOPE Background.  The commander Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) is responsible for providing the spiritual and religious care of patients and staff and supporting the Naval Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) mobilization requirements. BUMED provides chaplain billets to support these requirements. The Chaplain Corps provides chaplains to fill these billets. The diverse variety of religious denominations among patients and staff require a proportionate denominational mix of chaplains. 
Discussion.  The Roman Catholic faith group is a significant cross section of patients and staff requiring religious support at NMCSD. Approximately 30% of the hospital nature of pastoral care to Roman Catholics is sacramental in nature. The celebration and administration of sacraments requires the presence of a Catholic priest. Therefore, it is essential that Catholic priests are available to provide pastoral care and sacraments to Roman Catholic patients and staff at NMCSD and support deployments. Traditionally, the Navy Chaplain Corps has been able to provide and adequate number of Catholic priests to fill billet requirements and care for the Roman Catholic population within the naval sea services. In recent years, a shortage STATEMENT OF WORK NON-PERSONAL ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST SERVICES,I. INTRODUCTION/SCOPE. Discussion.  The Roman Catholic faith group is a significant cross section of patients and staff requiring religious support at NMCSD.

Therefore, it is essential that Catholic priests are available to provide pastoral care and sacraments to Roman Catholic patients and staff at NMCSD and support deployments. of Catholic priests in the civilian community has developed. This shortage is now reflected in the decreased availability of Catholic chaplains in the naval sea services everywhere. The decreased availability of Catholic Chaplains has created a situation in which adequate Catholic coverage is not available at NMCSD by Catholic chaplains are not available. Therefore, we need to diverse and implement new strategies to meet the spiritual and religious needs of Roman Catholics. This requires us to use Roman Catholic assets as efficiently as possible. There is also a need to identify new and additional sources for Catholic sacramental ministry.  Scope.

<DESC>NA The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Burnham Polymeric, Inc., 10036 Saratoga Road, South Glen Falls, NY 12803 on a sole source basis for the furnishing of Fiber Optic Marine Cable (FOMC). The government will supply the bare optical fiber and Burnham Polymeric will apply the special high strength coating using their proprietary process. The government does not possess the data necessary to compete this process. Additionally, the government has spent many years attempting to find/establish a process that would yield a FOMC that would withstand the environmental stresses (marine biological attacks (by crustaceans)) imparted in the intended application. Only Burnham Polymeric has been able to develop a process that produces a FOMC that meets all size (38 mil +/- 1 mil) and performance requirements (maximum attenuation p er meter of the coated cable shall be 0.25dB per kilometer at the 1550 nm wavelength, 0.5 dB per kilometer at 1300 nm, and withstand 30 lb. working tensile load with no attenuation degradation), and withstands attack by crustaceans. A three-year term requirements type contract is anticipated. Anuual quantities are estimated at 1.75 million meters of  FOMC. Specific delivery requirements will be stated within each order placed under the resultant contract. Projected delivery rate will be up to 40,000 meters per week. Delivery will be the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001, unless otherwise noted in any individual order. NAICS Code 335921 applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 employees. FSC is 6015.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611310   NAICS Code: 541620  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Georgia  Institute of  Technology.  The contractor has performed similar work under cooperative agreement CR 823020 and CR 828385.  Any other organization would expend valuable EPA resources (i.e., time and dollars) "coming up to speed" with regards to the research previously performed by Georgia Tech and developing a working knowledge  of the MEASURE model and the MOBILE-MEASURE model.  An estimate of this resource expenditure would be approximately 15-25% of the available resources." The EPA intends to develop an HDDV emissions module that would be integrated into the Mobile Emissions Assessment System for Urban and Regional  Evaluation (MEASURE) model.  MEASURE is used for research purposes to evaluate improved methods for estimating mobile source emissions. The project will be specific to the Atlanta metro-area. The contractor will be responsible for: Developing algorithms/equations to estimate emissions from  heavy-duty vehicles that are both spatially and temporally resolved.  These algorithms/equations shall evaluate, address, and include to the extent that credible evidence or data exists to support integration of valid cause-effect relationships into the MEASURE and MOBILE-MEASURE models the  following technical areas: Characterization and differentiation between the registered fleet and operating fleet; Characterization of vehicle attributes (i.e., vehicle weight, vehicle GVW, engine size, transmission configuration, fuel type, engine cylinder configuration; Characterization of vehicle  capacity and utilization factors  actual vehicle weights and weight distributions, loaded weight distributions; Differentiation between local fleet operational characteristics, regional fleet operational characteristics, and long-haul fleet operational characteristics spatial and temporal  characteristics; Heavy-duty vehicle engine starts  activity and emission factors; Heavy-duty vehicle trip generation rates; Idle time of heavy-duty vehicles; Speed/acceleration profiles for heavy-duty vehicles; Power demand correction factor(s). Supply data that will enable the development of a  GIS-model framework for the implementation of a Heavy-Vehicle Emissions Module. Develop a GIS-model framework from the data that will allow for implementation/integration of the aforementioned algorithms/equations; including the need to integrate with the existing MEASURE model framework and the  MOBILE-MEASURE model framework.Implement the aforementioned GIS-model framework to facilitate the spatial and temporal allocation of emissions.  Demonstrate the model for the Atlanta metro-area by estimating emissions for heavy-duty vehicles and produce emissions tables and maps.                      This is not a request for proposal.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the  posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement  or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.  Please submit your request in writing to David Boris at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45268 or fax your request to (513) 487-2109.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Mario Paixao Lopes, President, Administrative Council, Aeroportos E Seguranda Aérea, P.O. Box 58, Island of Sal, Republic of Cabo Verde, Phone: 238-412-626, Fax: 238-411-570  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the expansion and upgrade of Amilar Cabral International Airport in Sal, Cape Verde.  The Republic of Cape Verde, through its Aeroportos E Seguranda Aérea, has continued to develop the international airport on the Island of Sal in order to attract greater air traffic of both passengers and goods through the country.  ASA is keen to continue this development and as such requested that a U.S. firm conduct a feasibility study that will produce the roadmap for ASA to follow to continue its development of the airport.
 
The Amilcar International Airport (Sal Airport) is an ICAO Class 4E airport with a 3,306-meter runway with a pavement strong enough to handle an emergency landing of a U.S. space shuttle.  There is also a crosswind runway for smaller aircraft.  The main runway is equipped with a Category II (CAT II) Instrument Landing System (ILS) and the existing airfield lighting system is in the process of being replaced and upgraded to CAT II standards.  The airport has more than adequate ramp space and is currently handling 4E aircraft (the South African Airways 747-400).  

The existing passenger terminal, which has been modernized and enlarged in 2000, encompasses approximately 13,600 square meters of covered space and handles both international and domestic traffic in a single level passenger-processing configuration.  With the existing level of traffic, the terminal is already suffering from congestion in the domestic and international arrivals and departure areas.  In addition, the lack of boarding bridges at the terminals constitutes an inconvenience to tourists who have to climb and descend loading stairs on the apron.  The existing air cargo terminal is small with some 2,200 square meters of cargo handling space and 620 square meters of office space and is currently located in such a manner that it limits the future expansion of the passenger terminal.

The airport has greatly upgraded its security and is on the point of being classified as Category I in this regard by the FAA and ICAO.  In addition, Cape Verde will be the first country in Africa to fully implement CNS/ATM (a new air traffic control center is under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of 2003).  With the assistance of IATA, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) procedures have been developed for Cape Verde’s airports and a specific GNSS approach procedure has been adopted for the Sal Airport.  These improvements are providing the most secure air operations environment possible.

The Sal Airport will continue to be the main international airport and hub for Cape Verde.  A new airport for Praia is expected to open in late 2003 or early 2004, which will be capable of handling direct flights to Lisbon but not to further European destinations such as Germany, Italy and France, which currently constitute the main sources of tourism.  Additionally, this airport will not be able to handle transatlantic flights.

The feasibility study consists of an improvement and expansion to the Sal International Airport and is planned for implementation over the next five years.  The key components of the project include:

·	A new air cargo facility to support a cargo hub for West Africa-U.S. traffic and an expansion to the existing international and domestic passenger terminal to serve rapidly increasing tourism.  Currently, the existing cargo terminal is too small and blocks the expansion of the passenger terminal.  
·	A passenger terminal expansion, transforming the existing terminal into a two level operation with boarding bridges to meet international passenger demand, which has been estimated by International Air Transport Association (IATA) to triple to reaching a total of 1.4 million passengers over the next ten years.  
·	Reconfiguration and possible expansion of the aircraft parking apron, the provision of a new apron with connecting taxiways for the new cargo terminal.
·	The replacement of existing obsolete crash fire trucks.

The selected contractor will be responsible for completing the following tasks:

The terms of reference (TOR) for this project include 11 tasks:

1)	Collection and Review of Existing Data, Airport Inspection and Interviews
2)	Forecast of Demand for Passengers and Cargo
3)	Analysis of Airport Condition and Demand/Capacity and Development of Facility Requirements
4)	Conceptual Plans and Development Program
5)	Environmental Impact Analysis
6)	Capital Costs and Investment Requirements 
7)	Financial Analysis and Plan
8)	Concession Strategy
9)	Opportunities for the Participation of U.S. Suppliers
10)	USTDA Briefing
11)	Preparation and Submission of Reports

A more detailed description of the Terms of Reference can be found in Annex II to this RFP.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $291,650 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m., Friday, October 17, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Technical POC/ Program Manager, John Vergis, AFRL/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome  NY 13441-4114, telephone: (315) 330-1771, email: John.Vergis@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Renee F. Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  
The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division in collaboration with U.S. Joint Forces Command and Electronic Systems Center are soliciting proposals for innovative approaches in support of the Multi-sensor Aerospace-ground Joint ISR Interoperability Coalition (MAJIIC) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The objective of MAJIIC is to demonstrate network-centric "Post Before Process" ISR capabilities that will enable warfighters and C2ISR systems on IP based operational C2I networks to access and utilize near real time ISR data. ISR data of interest includes mission and sensor data from U.S. Joint Service and Multi-national coalition manned and unmanned air platforms with an initial focus on video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensors. MAJIIC capabilities will be open, scalable, secure, and non-intrusive to current operational ISR architectures; support common and emerging DoD/NATO/Commercial data formats; provide data pedigree and quality tagging; provide a range of data access methods including XML-based Web services and APIs; work in bandwidth challenged environments on DoD operational networks; and provide a flexible architecture that will support both distributed and traditional client-server deployments.  The ultimate goal of MAJIIC is to improve ISR data accessibility and utility in support of time sensitive missions, battlefield situational awareness, decision making, and C2I analysis.  The MAJIIC PRDA will focus on the following technology areas: database optimization techniques; XML-based web services; automated video, imagery and streaming data optimum dissemination techniques; and common geo-registration. In the area of database optimization, technologies are sought to find the optimal techniques in the storage, cataloging, retrieval, and searching of video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensor data, and mission situational awareness information, that will enhance the ability to share data across Service, Joint, and Coalition networks. This will include data parsing, conversion, compression, cataloging, and tagging. In the area of XML web-based services, technologies are sought that will allow for "disadvantaged" users (bandwidth challenged and/or lacking an application that supports raw ISR data formats) to access and display ISR data over the operational network in a legacy and/or commercial formats.  Advanced XML-based web services are also sought to support distributed machine-to-machine interactions, as well as concepts for managing information services across theater networks (e.g., service interface standards, service registries, ontology, access control).  Automated video, imagery, and streaming data dissemination techniques are required to allow for the optimal distribution of real-time and archived video, GMTI, EO, IR, SAR, ELINT, mission, and steaming data across networks that may have limited bandwidth constraints. Common geo-registration is needed to accurately determine target location by reducing detection errors from multiple sensors; MAJIIC is specifically concerned with registering GMTI detections, SAR, ELINT, EO, IR, and video data.  These technologies will be used and validated in military exercises, currently scheduled annually, two (2) per year.  The expectation is that one of these exercises will be in the U.S. and the other exercise will be in the Europe.  Exercise participation will include integration and checkout prior to the exercise, military operator training, technical support during the exercise, performance and discrepancy data collection, and post-exercise analysis.  Additionally, there will be approximately four (4) working group meetings per year, two (2) of which will be in the U.S. and two (2) in Europe, with each meeting lasting approximately one week.  An unclassified briefing for all interested firms will be held on 1 October 2003, at the Beeches Hotel and Conference Center, 7900 Turin Rd (Rt. 26), Rome, NY 13440 at 0900 hours.  A hard-copy briefing package will be made available to all attendees.  Please contact John Vergis at (315) 330-1771 (e-mail John.Vergis@rl.af.mil) or Lt. Tony Rendon (315) 330-2548 (e-mail: Antonio.Rendon@rl.af.mil) no later than 29 September 2003 if you plan to attend.  Firms who do not attend the briefing, but desire to have a copy of the additional material can access this information from the FedBizOps special notice available at  http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html, under the 03-16 PRDA link.  This material will be posted no later than 3 October 2003.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a white paper, not exceeding ten (10) pages, summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors' white papers may address all or a selected technology area(s) within the scope.  White papers that focus on selected technology areas should include a description of how the concept will integrate with the other technology areas.  The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All white papers MUST be submitted to ATTN: John Vergis, AFRL/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114, and reference PRDA-03-16-IFKA.  This PRDA is accepting white papers until 1 Oct 2009, but white papers must be submitted by no later than 10 Oct 03 for consideration of the initial FY 04 award. White papers submitted after this date are less likely to be funded in FY04.  Beyond FY 04, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 05 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; and, FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) Soundness of Approach; (2) Relevance to the Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Note: Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this PRDA.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging between $200,000 to $800,000 per fiscal year. Total funding for this PRDA is anticipated to be $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this PRDA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 04 - $1.000M; FY 05 - $5.565M; FY 06 - $6.195M; FY 07 - $6.565M and FY 08 - $5.175.  Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the US SECRET and NATO SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or eligible for, access to US SECRET and NATO SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this PRDA. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Renee F. Arcuri, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4777 or e-mail Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The e-mail must reference the title and PRDA 03-16-IFKA.  Questions prior to the submission of a proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, John Vergis/315-330-1771, John.Vergis@rl.af.mil.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, telephone (315) 330-4777 or e-mail Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is Modification 2 to the synopsis entitled JSC Information Management and Media Services (JIMMS), synopsis number 03JCS002 which was posted on June 30, 3002.  The purpose of this modification is to answer industry questions and provide more details on the Industry Briefing and tours which are to be held on October 14th and 15th. Question 1) I (large firm) have been contacted by several eligible small businesses asking us to appear as a subcontractor on their team for JETS, JIMMS or both.  Let's assume for a moment that my company did appear as a subcontractor to Prime Contractor 'Alpha' responding to JETS.	Let's further assume that my company also appeared as a subcontractor to Prime Contractor 'Beta' responding to JIMMS. That means there would be a single large business entity common to both small business contractor teams.	Does there exist any rule or preference that would deter my large company from appearing as a subcontractor on one team responding to JETS, and also on another team responding to JIMMS? Answer 1) There is no rule of preference that would deter your company from appearing as a subcontractor on the JETS, JIMMS or both procurements, provided 15 U.S.C. 644(o)(1) is not violated.	 Question 2) Would the chance of award to either team be diminished in any way by the presence of my company -- a large business entity being common to both teams?	 Answer 2)The JETS and JIMMS procurements are separate and being handled independent from each other.  Your firm showing up as a subcontractor for both the JETS and JIMMS procurements will not diminish the chance of award to either company you team with. Question 3) If, for example, team Alpha won selection on JETS, would that in any way reduce team Beta's chances of winning JIMMS or Visa versa?   Answer 3)No. See answer 2 above. Question 4) How do I determine if I am a small business for this procurement? Answer 4)To determine if you are considered a small business for this procurement you must first look at the NAICS code selected for this effort.  The NAICS code will either state a number of employees or a dollar threshold from which you determine if you are a small business.  For more information on NAICS size standards you can visit the following website:	     http://www.sba.gov/businessop/standards/guide.html	     JIMMS Industry Briefing Information: The JIMMS Industry Briefing will be held on October 14th in the Gilruth Center Alamo Ballroom at 9:00am CST.  (The map is linked for reference purposes at URL:  http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/IRD-PAO_Procurement/gilruth.pdf   .)  Attendees are encouraged to arrive at 8:30am to allow adequate time to register. Companies who have not already stated their intent to attend the briefing are requested to send an e-mail to the points of contact with company information and the number of people who will be in attendance at the briefing.  This information is needed by COB October 6th.  If your company has already received confirmation of registration please do not send another notice as we already have you registered. JIMMS Tours Information: Companies interested in taking tours of the buildings to be supported by the JIMMS contractor should sign up for a tour time during their initial registration the morning of the 14th.  The JIMMS tours will be held from 1:00pm to 4:00pm CST on October 14th and from 9:00am to 4:00pm CST on October 15th. The October 14th tours are reserved for companies who are located outside the Houston area.	As this tour will be on a Federal facility, badging of tour participants is required.   U.S. Citizens: A photo ID (drivers license or state ID card) is required to obtain a visitor badge for on-site tours (badges/ID's from other Government facilities/companies are not acceptable forms of identification).   For foreign nationals: All Non-U.S. Citizens requiring visitor access to JSC must be documented in the NASA Foreign National Management System (NFNMS). The foreign national badging process can take up to three weeks and must be completed before the tour date.  If a foreign national badging is still in process at the time of the tour they will not be able to access the site.  For more information on the badging process for foreign nationals please contact the points of contact listed above. Be advised that the JIMMS building tour requires a significant amount of walking.  If you are in need of special assistance please notify the points of contact so special arrangements can be made.   Tours are limited to three (3) representatives per company.	  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment #1 is to post questions and answers related to this procurement.

Question 1.  We have described variance between consumables for pipettes and tips. There is no 300ul tips specified for 50-300ul 8-ch. pipettor. Should we consider the specs of pipettor as 50-200ul. 

Answer: We need tips of ranges up to 300ul. The specification is changed from “Tips, STERILE, 20-200 ul - 1000/pk - 6” to “Tips, STERILE, 50ul (or less)—300ul – 1000/pk – 6”

Question 2.  Please clarify the type of microplate reader that is required.  In the last bid, there was a reader with on board software (in russian language, english, etc). You may recall that in our last bid, the spec called for a reader with on board software for data analysis.  One advantage was that the language choice included Russian.

In this bid, it doesn't specify whether the reader should be computer controlled or have on board software for use without a computer.  If it is intended for use with a computer, what type of software do you want.  For example, will you do curve fitting, what type, report types desired, etc.  What language should the software be in?  What kind of computer will it need to run on?  What type of printer will you use?  What file formats are required?  The software specification for microplate readers is much more complicated than the reader itself.

Perhaps you simply want to control the reader from Microsoft excel and capture the raw data.  Please let us know the details.  When responding to a bid such as this one, if you follow the letter of the bid, you will end up with a reader that cannot be used without a computer and the software required to control it, because the reader alone is the least expensive and that is all that the bid calls for.

Answer: On-board LCD, and ports for PC interface, and printer output; Windows-capable, with user-definable protocol; Software: Courve fits, and endpoint screening assay; Self-test; Manual and automatic plate layout, control and assay validation, cutoff criteria, data analysis; Lab technical and/or service manuals (operating instructions, installation, maintenance) in Russian. 

Question 3.   No capacity requirement is listed for the centrifuge do you have a minimum number of tubes that you would need?

Answer: Centrifuge must accommodate at least 6 tubes. 

 

Question 4.  The cylinders listed do not specify glass but I am assuming glass is needed?

Answer: Cylinders should NOT be glass.  They must be polystyrene or polymethylpentene.

<DESC>This sources sought announcement initially posted 19 Nov 02 under the auspices of market research is hereby modified to formally advertise Solicitation No. MDA412-03-R-0002 scheduled for electronic release on this website on or about 28 Feb 03.  The solicitation will seek offers under commercially negotiated best value source selection procedures in response to the Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Europe (DoDDS-E) Heidelberg School Maintenance Program 2003 contract initiative for the acquisition of comprehensive maintenance and custodial support services for over 100 facilities and accompanying grounds strategically located throughout the Heidelberg, Bavaria, Kaiserslautern, Mediterranean, and Isles districts.  Contract type will be a task order driven Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity arrangement manifesting a cost profile ranging from $280,000,000 to $340,000,000 with a guaranteed minimum amount to be disclosed at time of solicitation issuance.  Contract award is tentatively scheduled for 01 Jul 03 subsequently encompassing a base year, 4 one-year option periods, 1 three-year award term period, and a final two-year award term period aggregating to a maximum contract performance period of 10 years.  Immediately available for phase-in will be up to 26 facilities operated under jurisdictional authority of the Heidelberg district.  Remaining districts will be activated for phase-in on an optional basis at government discretion pending examination of award results and time frames necessary for appropriate transition from other contractual obligations.  It should be noted it is the government's express intent to award a single contract integrating both maintenance and custodial support services with proviso a multiple award scenario may be considered.  In the event multiple awards do materialize, the government will not award a contract at any level lower than an entire district.  Major evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be past performance weighted at 35%, management at 35%, and technical at 30%, the combination of all non-cost related factors being slightly more important than price.  This contract initiative represents a true performance-based services approach whereby in response to a solicitation generated statement of objectives tasks will be performed in accordance with a contractor-authored statement of work, other applicable contract terms and conditions, and performance metrics firmly established by industry standards.  At time of initial screening of proposals the government reserves the right to limit competition to the most highly competitive offerors from which award will ultimately be achieved via the conduct of oral presentations.  Concurrently, this will not preclude the contracting officer from awarding on initial offers without the conduct of discussions if doing so is deemed to be in the best interest of the government.  Level of competition for this procurement is unrestricted.  Once the solicitation is made available for download it will be the responsibility of competing offerors to monitor the website for release of applicable amendments or other related information.  All interested sources possessing the necessary resources and proven capability to perform a requirement of this magnitude are encouraged to submit an offer that will be considered.  FedBizOpps registrants interested in this acquisition are requested to email the below point of contact to ensure compilation of a complete and accurate competitor database.

drogue" that is a smaller version of the drogue specified in the "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual". The length of the "mini-drogue" shall be chosen so that the drag-area-ratio of the complete drifter system shall be not less than 40. Drifters shall use a "mini-drogue" with its deployed vertical center at 15 meters depth.  (5.) SPECIFIC "MINI-DROGUE" MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS: a) The holey-sock should be made from fray resistant nylon cloth; diameter 60-63 cm, length computed to provide a drag-area-ratio of 40 or larger. The holey-sock shall have at least three segments with supporting circular framing sewn into place. Each segment shall have two pairs of 30cm diameter opposing holes, offset by 90 degrees from each other. Drogue is centered at 15 m depth. b) Inert ballast material shall be inserted into the lowest ring of the mini-drogue" of sufficient weight that a net tension of 1.5-2.0 kg will be exerted by the tether on the surface float. c) Rings made of hollow sea-water resistant, plastic tubing shall be used as the circular supporting framework for the drogue. These shall be drilled to allow flooding. d) Attachment bridle of the drogue shall consist of hub and at least 4 spokes of 0.32 diameter polypropylene-impregnated wire rope radials, positively attached and epoxy-restrained at hub to tether from surface float. Radials attach to top PVC ring using abrasion resistant cushions fixed at 90 degrees spacing. 10 cm-long rubber air hose carroting fitted where radials enter hub. Attachment point of tether to hub covered with a minimum of 15 cm long polyurethane carrot. e) The tether from the drogue to the float shall be at least 0.32 cm in diameter made of polypropylene-impregnated wire rope. There shall be no sub-surface float attached to the tether. The carrot to the clerical surface float shall be at least 15 cm long. (6.) SHIPPING CONTAINER: The shipping container should be double walled container measuring less than 43" * 43" *43" cube capable of domestic and international air, land, or sea transport. Container should allow easy access for inspection and testing of instrumentation and ARGOS telemetry system at the point of delivery. Containers and closures shall comply with the interstate 
Commerce Commission regulations, uniform Freight Classification Rules, or regulations of other carriers as applicable to the mode of transportation. Individual Drifters should be configured so that deployment from Volunteer Observing Ships can be readily done without changing the shipping configuration. The tether should be wrapped and taped with water-soluble tape around a water-soluble cardboard tube that should be left in place for deployment to prevent tangling. The drogue should be wrapped with water-soluble paper tape that should be left on the drogue upon deployment. The tape should dissolve quickly once the drifter has been deployed, allowing for an orderly release of the drogue. Instructions for deployment should be attached to the outside of each unit. Contractor shall complete a specification sheet and submit it 
to the Global Drifter Center (GDC) before a Government Bill of Lading is issued by the GDC. Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each buoy produced and provide calibration and message format information. (7.) RELIABILITY CLAUSE - Drifter transmission power should last on average a minimum of 365 days. A new "Specifications Sheet" must accompany any modification that is made if a buoy is found defective and is returned to the manufacturer for repair. Manufacturer should cover shipping costs for any returned defective drifters. Revised Specification sheets must be provided before drifting buoys are re-shipped. Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each 
buoy produced and provide calibrations and message format information.

<DESC>Electronic Maintenance Support System (EMSS) designed to act as a decision support tool aiding the Marine Corps maintenance technician and operator in the performance of needed maintenance activities.  
The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Combat Equipment and Support Systems, Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment Branch, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development of a tool designed to enhance maintenance quality and automate diagnostic capabilities.  Specifically, the system must integrate Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM), Computer Based Training (CBT), Built in Test and Built in Test Equipment (BIT/BITE), and the Marine Corps Family of Automated Test Equipment (MCATES).  
This RFI seeks the following information:  Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, and operating an EMSS, with an emphasis on applying existing technology and software; Information about existing equipment that could support an EMSS, thus minimizing the need for special development, associated costs, and time delays; Technical feasibility assessments of the alternatives; Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives; Schedule estimates;
REQUIREMENTS:  This section enumerates the functional requirements for an EMSS for purposes of responding to the RFI.  As noted, the intent of an EMSS system is to provide an electronic maintenance support system/decision support tool that will link IETMs, CBT, BIT/BITE, and the MCATES.  MCSC envisions EMSS as a portable maintenance aid used to display technical data, display and analyze system health status, run intrusive diagnostics, assist in fault isolation and repair mentoring, and up/down load system data (health monitoring).  EMSS, to be effective, must have compatibility with Autonomic Logistics as the on system diagnostics tester.  As other logistics architectures become defined and implemented, EMSS will also document maintenance actions, query and order parts, maintain real-time digital equipment record jackets, and provide the ability to analyze prognostic data based on sensor input.  The goal of the EMSS is to accomplish most or all of the following requirements:  Host the Global Combat Support System – Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) software and interface with the logistics pipeline;
Be a reconfigurable, portable maintenance aid, commercially ruggedized, impact and weather resistant, wearable or hand held controller with a high-resolution, sunlight readable display; Consider the environment -- arctic, jungle, and desert climatic conditions; Store and retrieve data files from Floppy Disk, CD, CDRW, DVD, flash memory cards, USB Device and network connections – collected data must be in a GCSS-MC compliant format; Include network communication capabilities through a standard RJ45 or BNC type connector (This allows the EMSS to be connected to a network with standard protocols like Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)); Support wireless interface(s) with industry standard encryption; Display and support user interaction with technical data, such as Electronic Technical Manuals and Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs/IETMs), schematics, wiring diagrams, parts lists, and system drawings; Display moving and still graphic information, as used in CBT and animated help files; Support the execution of test and diagnostics routines developed in multiple programming languages and environments; Provide a standardized style sheet for diagnostic programming of test assets within EMSS; Be one-person portable by 90 percent of the target audience (maintainers) and limited to 44 pounds, including the transit case; additional transit cases required for housing ancillary equipment (i.e. cables connectors) should be minimized and also limited to 44 pounds each; Have Primary Power capable of operating on battery power for a minimum of three hours (threshold), four hours (objective); battery must have the capability to be recharged from an 18-32VDC source and conventional house current of 110-120VAC; Provide input devices (i.e. keyboard, mouse, infrared, voice and/or any other new technical device) to allow the operator to interact with the system; Have self-test capability; Be designed as an open architecture system; Be configured with a standard paper printer interface (i.e. parallel or USB); Be capable through application of functional run time software/IETM to augment the supported systems built-in test (EMSS will not replace “on board” built-in test equipment); Emulate existing General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE) in stand-alone and diagnostic test applications (Objective:  Digital Multimeter, Frequency Counter, Oscilloscope, Signal Generator, Distortion Analyzer, Function Generator, and RF Power Measurements.  Threshold:  Digital Multimeter, Oscilloscope, Frequency Counter, and Signal Generator); Have Standard Buss Controls that will support a wide range of weapon systems and platforms; Reduce footprint and support cost – be reconfigurable to support the full implementation of the following:  MIL-STD-1553A/B; RS-232; RS-422; RS-429; RS-485; SP-TCM; Universal Serial Buss (USB); IEEE 1394 Fire Wire; Allison Transmission Electronic Control (ATEC) Serial Communications; J1708; J1939 (CAN); GM-UART Data-bus protocol interface; ISO-9141 Data-bus protocol; Modular Interface Communication (MIC); Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)/Copper Distributed Data Interface (CDDI);
As noted, the goal of this RFI is to gather information to determine the feasibility of developing an EMSS that meets most or all of the requirements enumerated above.  Respondents are encouraged to make and document assumptions if necessary to clarify their responses.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION:  Ideally, the EMSS will meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government realizes that the solution may require incremental development and fielding, and is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet most or all of these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  
One possible solution would be to provide a common ruggedized computer that will include common TMDE functionality and associated technical manuals.  It will also have the capability to attach to specific commodity “boxes” (e.g., specific TMDE functionality for either Motor Transport equipment or Communications-Electronics equipment).  The common ruggedized computer will have the capability to load updates of specific technical manuals and TMDE functionality (e.g., there would be a dedicated CD-ROM with periodic updates sent specifically to Communications-Electronics maintenance personnel).  All hardware would be dedicated, and though designed to work independently, each will have the capability to communicate to higher-level maintenance and logistical activities via the GCSS.
This RFI seeks information about a fully dedicated self-contained EMSS to speed field maintenance support while reducing the associated logistics trail.  Specifically, the Government will seek to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing), and alternative technical solutions that incorporate increasing levels of integration.  Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives/solutions that can be demonstrated to support the functional requirements described in section above.
SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE:  Following is a suggested outline and suggested page count limits for a response to this RFI.  The intent of this outline is to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 
Section 1 – Conceptual Solutions:  Briefly, describe at least one potential conceptual solution for an EMSS, including estimated reliability and availability characteristics of all identified alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the system to expand with modules that could add on to a common platform to meet the needs of all Marine Corps maintenance concerns (i.e., communications-electronics, Motor Transport, ordnance systems, etc.).  (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram per alternative identifying the brand/type of equipment)
Section 2 – Feasibility Assessment: Briefly, describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements.  (1 page per alternative)
Section 3 – Cost and Schedule Estimates:  Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs.  Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)
Section 4 – Corporate Expertise:  Briefly, describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  (No suggested page count)  In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including TMDE development and any relevant lessons learned (1-2 pages per project).  Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.
Section 5 – Additional Materials:  Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.
INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETINGS:  There are no Information Exchange Meetings currently planned.  MCSC will consider meeting with interested potential respondents.  If you are interested in requesting such a meeting, please indicate in your response.  DISCLAIMER:  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses shall be submitted by no later than 20 October 2003 to Contracts Directorate, Code CTQ3WS, ATTN:  Ms Wendy Stevenson, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA  22134-6050.

<DESC>The USAF Force Protection Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to high end analysis of military working dog (MWD) body temperature.  The system must read the temperature of the MWD either actively or when queried by a chip reader.  This initiative will investigate the difference in core temperature and subcutaneous temperature to determine if a subcutaneous chip will reliably indicate a MWD working temperature.  Data on other vital signs (blood pressure, respiration, pulse, etc.) would be useful and add to the versatility of any product, however reliable temperature sensing is the prime objective.  Products should be available off-the-shelf for use in this initiative.  The system sought should be easy to use and read by the MWD handler.  Data from the sensor should be compatible with common statistical analysis programs used in academic or scientific research.  If required, chip readers should be compact enough to carry as an additional piece of MWD handler equipment.  If the reader/recorder unit is to be attached to the MWD on a collar or harness, it should be compact and lightweight so as to not hinder MWD normal searching techniques and movements.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements. All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request. Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Security Forces Center. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement. SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 10 October 2003. White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter. Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file. Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Tim Dabbs of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at dabbst@ctc.com or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935. The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Dabbs. You may contact Mr. Dabbs with any questions you may have at (814) 269-2828. Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged. GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the report back to the client.

Statement of Work:

1.0 Background

The Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS).  The CVB is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act to ensure that veterinary biologics available for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of animal diseases are pure, safe, potent and effective.

The CVB is comprised of two sections:

	1. CVB Policy, Evaluation and Licensing (CVB-PEL)
	2. CVB Inspection and Compliance (CVB-IC)

Both sections are primarily located in Ames, Iowa with a small CVB-PEL office in Riverdale, Maryland.  The Directorate for CVB consists of two section Directors responsible for the direction of all CVB program activities.

CVB primary activities include:
"	Biologics licensing, permitting, and policy development.
"	Biologics inspection and compliance of licensed products.
"	Confirmatory assays on new biologics products prior to licensure.
"	Reference and reagent production, evaluation, and distribution.
"	Developmental activity & training.

In keeping with the "furnished or approved by APHIS" language of the 9 CFR, CVB prepares and provides for shipment to biologics manufacturers virus intended for vaccination-challenge studies.  The host animal test described in 9 CFR 113.310 is used to assay the protective effect of modified live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus vaccine serials, and it could be used to assay the protection provided by killed IBR virus vaccines.   Additional testing may be requested by CVB-IC personnel for a field problem, or may be needed for correlation of in vitro assays to a current 9 CFR assay.  All of these vaccination-challenge studies require a validated challenge strain suitable for demonstrating protection.

2.0 Objectives

The objective of this study is to validate the effectiveness of CVB supplied IBR challenge viruses to produce clinically relevant disease in susceptible calves, and thus ensure that measured parameters of disease will meet criteria set forth in 9 CFR 113.310. Additionally, information obtained will be used to guide policy making decisions, update laboratory testing at CVB, and advise biologics manufacturers on vaccination-challenge protocols. 




3.0 Scope of work

Contractor(s) will work with CVB personnel to design a project that will scientifically validate the pathogenicity of the IBR challenge virus. Measured parameters related to the validation of the challenge virus will be acceptable to APHIS. We anticipate that a minimum of 30 calves housed for up to 60 days will be required to complete this work. Contractor will conduct the animal work related to the challenge studies.

It will be required that the contractor(s) have very specific expertise and knowledge necessary to perform the work to be conducted.

The Government reserves the right to only award selected portions of the contract.  The contract will be administered on a modular (in Tasks) basis; whereby, the subsequent tasks are contingent on the successful completion of the preceding task.

4.0 Definitions

CVB-USDA-Center for Veterinary Biologics.

CVB-PEL Policy, Evaluation, and Licensing unit of the Center for Veterinary Biologics.

COTR-Contraction Officers Technical Representative.

5.0 Contractor Task Management- The contractor(s) shall provide management of all the tasks assigned to them.

5.1a. Deliverable:  Biweekly Status Reports - Contractor(s) shall submit biweekly status reports for the duration of this contract.  Task status will consist of identifying work completed, work projected (including expected timetables), problems encountered and recommended solutions.

5.1b. Deliverable Due Date: The contractor(s) shall submit status reports on a biweekly basis on the Friday of the working week, for the duration of the task via electronic mail to the COTR.

5.1c. Performance Measures: The COTR shall validate that biweekly status reports are timely as indicated in the due date and the inclusion of data required is accurate and complete.  Inaccurate or incomplete status reports shall be corrected and resubmitted at no cost to the government.


6.0 Tasks To Be Performed

It is expected that actual delivery deadlines and general project timetables will be proposed by the contractor(s), and agreed to by the COTR at the start of the project.




6.1 Performance of the test

The IBR challenge virus will be validated in susceptible calves in two phases.  The goal of phase I is to assist the investigators in defining the challenge virus dilution (viral dose) inducing infection and clinical disease in calves.  Data from this preliminary assay will serve as basis for determining the range of test virus dilutions to be assayed in the phase II or large challenge-inoculation study.         

By using a sufficient number of animals in phase II, we will be able to fully characterize the effectiveness of the challenge material to cause clinical disease. Briefly, IBR challenge-inoculation will usually result in generalized clinical host response and/or respiratory disease.  Parameters to be evaluated by the contractor shall include, but not limited to: recording of clinical signs such as fever, anorexia, depression, nasal and lacrimal discharge. Contractor will also collect blood samples and nasal swabs as agreed for testing at CVB laboratory or elsewhere.  

Statistical analysis of results will be performed in collaboration with CVB statisticians.

	6.1a Deliverables: 
"	An experimental protocol, timelines, and bid for the project.
"	Tasks identified under Task Management above.

6.1b Deliverable Due Date:
"	Experimental protocol and timelines for the project shall be submitted at beginning of contract + 10 business days.
"	Completion of experimentation: beginning of contract + 1 year. 
"	Tasks identified under Task Management above.


7.0 Quality Assurance

The contractor(s) shall deliver a biweekly status report as described in section 5.1 of this document.  The biweekly status reports will be read by the COTR who will work with the contractor to resolve any issues.

8.0 Performance

8.0.1 Period of Performance

The period of performance is expected to be award date plus 12   
months for the validation of challenge virus studies. 

8.0.2 Performance Standards

Contractor performance will be measured by the ability to adhere to deliverable deadlines as agreed between the COTR and the contractor at the start of the project.


8.0.3 Nonperformance

In the event that the tasks outlined in section 6.0 (Tasks to be Performed) are not performed according to performance measures also identified in section 6.0:
"	The Government will notify the contractor of failure to perform according to performance measures, and the contractor will revise task deliverable at no cost to the Government within the time scales required by the project as outlined in section 6.0.
"	The Government will notify the contractor of failure to complete tasks according to deadlines outlined in section 6.0.  Sustained failure to complete tasks on time will result in cancellation of the contract.  It will also be required that the contractor reimburse the Government for any costs related to tasks not done to appropriate performance measures. 

The Government also reserves the right to only award selected portions of the contract.  The contract will be administered on a modular (in Tasks) bases; whereby, the subsequent tasks are contingent on the successful completion of the preceding task.


9.0 Government Roles and Responsibilities

The CVB shall designate a representative(s) to coordinate all aspects of this project.  All work performed at the CVB laboratory will be coordinated with the contractor(s) by the COTR.

Statement of Work:

1.0 Background

The Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS).  The CVB is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act to ensure that veterinary biologics available for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of animal diseases are pure, safe, potent and effective.

The CVB is comprised of two sections:

	1. CVB Policy, Evaluation and Licensing (CVB PEL)
	2. CVB Inspection and Compliance (CVB IC)

Both sections are primarily located in Ames, Iowa with a small CVB PEL office in Riverdale, Maryland.  The Directorate for CVB consists of two section Directors responsible for the direction of all CVB program activities.

CVB primary activities include:
"	Biologics licensing, permitting, and policy development.
"	Biologics inspection and compliance of licensed products.
"	Confirmatory assays on new biologics products prior to licensure.
"	Reference and reagent production, evaluation, and distribution
"	Developmental activity & training.

In keeping with the "furnished or approved by APHIS" language of the 9 CFR, CVB prepares and provides for shipment to biologics manufacturers virus intended for vaccination-challenge studies.  The host animal test described in 9 CFR 113.215 is used to assay the protective effect of killed bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) vaccine serials.  A similar, larger test (9 CFR 113.311) is used by the firms to assay efficacy of prelicense modified live vaccines.  Additional testing may be requested by CVB IC personnel for a field problem, or may be needed for correlation of in vitro assays to a current 9 CFR assay.  All of these vaccination-challenge studies require a validated challenge strain suitable for demonstrating product performance.

2.0 Objectives

The objective of this study is to validate the effectiveness of CVB supplied BVD challenge viruses to produce clinically relevant disease in susceptible calves, and thus ensure that measured parameters of disease will meet criteria set forth in 9 CFR 113.215 and 113.311. Additionally, information obtained will be used to guide policy making decisions, update laboratory testing at CVB, and advise biologics manufacturers on vaccination-challenge protocols. 



3.0 Scope of work

Contractor(s) will work with CVB personnel to design a project that will scientifically validate the pathogenicity of the BVD challenge virus. Measured parameters related to the validation of the challenge virus will be acceptable to APHIS. We anticipate that a minimum of 30 calves housed for up to 60 days will be required to complete this work. Contractor will conduct the animal work related to the challenge studies.

It will be required that the contractor(s) have very specific expertise and knowledge necessary to perform the work to be conducted.

The Government reserves the right to only award selected portions of the contract.  The contract will be administered on a modular (in Tasks) basis; whereby, the subsequent tasks are contingent on the successful completion of the preceding task.

4.0 Definitions

CVB-USDA-Center for Veterinary Biologics.

CVB PEL Policy, Evaluation, and Licensing unit of the Center for Veterinary Biologics.

COTR-Contraction Officers Technical Representative.

5.0 Contractor Task Management- The contractor(s) shall provide management of all the tasks assigned to them.

5.1a. Deliverable:  Biweekly Status Reports - Contractor(s) shall submit biweekly status reports for the duration of this contract.  Task status will consist of identifying work completed, work projected (including expected timetables), problems encountered and recommended solutions.

5.1b. Deliverable Due Date: The contractor(s) shall submit status reports on a biweekly basis on the Friday of the working week, for the duration of the task via electronic mail to the COTR.

5.1c. Performance Measures: The COTR shall validate that biweekly status reports are timely as indicated in the due date and the inclusion of data required is accurate and complete.  Inaccurate or incomplete status reports shall be corrected and resubmitted at no cost to the government.


6.0 Tasks To Be Performed

It is expected that actual delivery deadlines and general project timetables will be proposed by the contractor(s), and agreed to by the COTR at the start of the project.

6.1 Performance of the test

The BVD type 2 challenge virus will be validated in susceptible calves in two phases.  The goal of phase I is to assist the investigators in defining the challenge virus dilution (viral dose) inducing infection and clinical disease in calves.  Data from this preliminary assay will serve as basis for determining the range of test virus dilutions to be assayed in the phase II or large challenge-inoculation study.         

By using a sufficient numbers of animal in phase II, we will be able to fully characterize the effectiveness of the challenge material to cause clinical disease. Briefly, BVD type 2 challenge-inoculation will result in a generalized clinical host response and occurrence of abnormal hematological values in white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and platelets. Parameters to be evaluated by the contractor shall include, but not limited to: recording of clinical signs such as fever, anorexia, depression, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and oral lesions. Contractor will also collect blood samples and nasal swabs as agreed for testing at CVB laboratory or elsewhere. This may involve subcontracting the services of a diagnostic laboratory for hematological testing.

Statistical analysis of results will be performed in collaboration with CVB statisticians.

	6.1a Deliverables: 
"	An experimental protocol, timelines, and bid for the project.
"	Tasks identified under Task Management above.

6.1b Deliverable Due Date:
"	Experimental protocol and timelines for the project shall be submitted at beginning of contract + 10 business days.
"	Completion of experimentation: beginning of contract + 1 year. 
"	Tasks identified under Task Management above.


7.0 Quality Assurance

The contractor(s) shall deliver a biweekly status report as described in section 5.1 of this document.  The biweekly status reports will be read by the COTR who will work with the contractor to resolve any issues.

8.0 Performance

8.0.1 Period of Performance

The period of performance is expected to be award date plus 12 months for the validation of challenge virus studies. 

8.0.2 Performance Standards

Contractor performance will be measured by the ability to adhere to deliverable deadlines as agreed between the COTR and the contractor at the start of the project.

8.0.3 Nonperformance

In the event that the tasks outlined in section 6.0 (Tasks to be Performed) are not performed according to performance measures also identified in section 6.0:
"	The Government will notify the contractor of failure to perform according to performance measures, and the contractor will revise task deliverable at no cost to the Government within the time scales required by the project as outlined in section 6.0.
"	The Government will notify the contractor of failure to complete tasks according to deadlines outlined in section 6.0.  Sustained failure to complete tasks on time will result in cancellation of the contract.  It will also be required that the contractor reimburse the Government for any costs related to tasks not done to appropriate performance measures. 

The Government also reserves the right to only award selected portions of the contract.  The contract will be administered on a modular (in Tasks) bases; whereby, the subsequent tasks are contingent on the successful completion of the preceding task.


9.0 Government Roles and Responsibilities

Niiler (1991): "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual".  Scripps Institution of Oceanography, SIO Reference 91/6.58pp., and updated in 1995, DBCP Tech Document Number 4).  Drifters must use the ARGOS system to send data using a 90-second repetition rate, with a 100% duty cycle.  The transmission power to ARGOS should be 1 watt or less.  The Drifters shall have Sea Surface Temperature, Submergence and Battery Voltage Sensors (see "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual" for complete specifications of all sensors, drogue, transmitter and drifter general construction guidelines); Drifters shall be built with a holey-sock "Mini-Drogue" that is a smaller (60cm diameter) version of the drogue specified in the "WOCE/TOGA Lagrangian Drifter Construction Manual".  The length of the "Minim-Drogue" shall be chosen so that the drag-area-ratio of the complete drifter system shall be not less than 40.  The specific construction technique has to have a proven history of deployment at sea.  "Proven history" shall consist of 10 holey-sock drifters, transmitting for over 180 days without drogue loss.  Drifters shall use a "Mini-Drogue" with its deployed vertical center at 15 meters depth.  Specific "Mini-Drogue" materials and construction specifications:  a) The holey-sock should be made from fray resistant nylon clothe; diameter 60-63 cm, length computed to provide a drag-area-ratio of 40 or larger.  The holey-sock shall have at least three segments with supporting circular framing sewn into place.  Each segment shall have two pairs of 30cm diameter opposing holes, offset by 90 degrees from each other.  Drogue is centered at 15 m depth.  b) Inert ballast material shall be inserted into the lowest ring of the "Mini-Drogue" of sufficient weight that a net tension of 1.5-2.0 kg will be exerted by the tether on the surface float.  c) Rings made of hollow sea-water resistant, plastic tubing shall be used as the circular supporting framework for the drogue.  These shall be drilled to allow flooding d)  Attachment bridle of the drogue shall consist of hub and at least 4 spokes of 0.32 diameter polypropylene-impregnated wire rope radials, positively attached and epoxy-restrained at hub to tether from surface float.  Radials attach to top PVC ring using abrasions resistant cushions fixed at 60 - 90 degrees spacing.  10 cm-long rubber air hose carroting fitted where radial enter hub.  Attachment point of tether to hub covered with a minimum of 15 cm long polyurethane carrot.  E) The tether from the drogue to the float shall be at least 0.32 cm in diameter made of polypropylene-impregnated wire rope.  There shall be no sub-surface float attached to the tether.  The carrot to the spherical surface float shall be at least 15 cm long.  6.  SHIPPING CONTAINER:  The shipping container should be double walled container measuring less than 43" * 43" *43" cube capable of domestic and international air, land or sea transport.  Container should allow easy access for inspection and testing of instrumentation and ARGOS telemetry system at the point of delivery.  Containers and closures shall comply with the interstate Commerce Commission regulations, uniform Freight Classification Rules, or regulations of other carriers as applicable to the mode of transportation.  Individual Drifters should be configured so that deployment from Volunteer Observing Ships can be readily done without changing the shipping configuration.  The tether should be wrapped and taped with water-soluble tape around a water-soluble cardboard tube that should be left in place for deployment to prevent tangling.  The drogue should be wrapped with water-soluble paper tape that should be left on the drogue upon deployment.  The tape should dissolve quickly once the drifter has been deployed, allowing for an orderly release of the drogue.  Instructions for deployment should be attached to the outside of each unit.  Contractor shall complete the attached specification sheet and submit to Global Drifter Center before a GBL is issued.  Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each buoy produced and provides calibrations and message format information.  7)  RELIABILITY CLAUSE - Drifter transmission power should last on average a minimum of 365 days.  A new "Specifications Sheet" must accompany any modification that is made if a buoy is found defective and is returned to the manufacturer for repair.  Manufacturer should cover shipping costs for any returned defective drifters.  Revised Specification sheets must be provided before drifting buoys are reshipped.  Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each buoy produced and provide calibrations and message format information.  SVP SPECIFICATION SHEET (SVP3, MINI-DROGUED) VERSION MODIFIED 28 OCT 2002:  ARGOS ID(s); Manufacturer; Sensor Array SVP; Surface Float Description; Tether description; Drogue description; Drogue depth; Drogue Length; Cross-sectional area above drogue; Cross-sectional area of the drogue; Transmitter type; Transmitter manufacturer; Controller manufacturer; duty cycle continuous; Message length 32 bits; Message format; Observation cycle 15 minutes; Repetition rate 90 seconds; Power Supply; Antifouling; Battery voltage sensor; Battery voltage equation; Temperature sensor type (include manufacturer and model); Temperature equation; Drogue sensor type; Submergence equation; Salinity Sensor Type (include manufacturer and model); Salinity Equation; Barometer type; BP equation; Wind Speed Sensor Type (include manufacturer and model) Wind Speed Equations; Wind Direction Sensor Type (include manufacturer and model) Wind Direction Equations; GPS Type (include manufacturer and model); GPS Equations; Additional Sensor Types (include manufacturer and model); Additional sensor equations; Shipping container and Comments.
