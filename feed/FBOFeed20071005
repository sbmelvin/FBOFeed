<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS Code: 541620 Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Estuarine Research Federation in support of the 2009 Estuarine Research Federation Conference.  The Statement of Work and rationale  for sole source purchase is as follows: Statement of Work Project Description:	The 20th biennial conference of the Estuarine Research Federation will be held on November 2-6, 2009 in Portland, Oregon.  The primary objective of this conference is to provide opportunities for the exchange of  information among research scientists and managers working in interdisciplinary and/or interagency settings and who need to be informed about the latest estuarine and coastal research and management issues. The secondary objective is to further the mission of the Federation:  The Federation  advances understanding and wise stewardship of estuarine and coastal ecosystems worldwide.  Its mission is to: "	Promote research in estuarine and coastal ecosystems "	Support education of scientists, decision-makers and the public "	Facilitate communication among these groups In early 2009, we  expect to receive about 1,400 abstracts covering all aspects of estuarine and coastal research and management.  These presentations are balanced between oral and poster presentations.  Different presentation formats have included symposia, workshops, invited and contributed oral and poster  sessions, panel discussions, colloquia and a plenary.  Also, many types of structured and unstructured special events and receptions allow the attendees to communicate extremely effectively.   Over 1,500 attendees are expected at this conference.  The distribution of attendees' affiliations is  approximately 25% from federal agencies, 10-15% from state and local resource management agencies, 50-55 % scientists from academic or research institutions and approximately 20-25% students from various departments of estuarine and coastal sciences. Task Requirements:  	EPA will gain visibility  while promoting awareness of OWOW's mission in the estuarine and coastal environments through the following venues: Task 1.  Convening and participating in oral and poster sessions.  EPA scientists and managers will convene several sessions at this conference.  As in the past, we also expect  strong EPA participation as presenters in the oral and poster sessions.   	Task 2. Publicity. EPA OWOW will be publicized in ERF's newsletters, press releases, printed conference program and abstract book, on ERF's web site:  www.erf.org, plus on posters and banners set up on-site in the main  conference gathering areas. 	Task 3. Ad space.  EPA OWOW will receive space for a full-page advertisement in the conference program and in an ERF newsletter. Task 4.  Complementary registrations. EPA will be offered 5 complimentary registrations to the ERF 2009 conference. 	Task 5. Display space. A  10-ft by-10 ft area and a skirted table will be provided for EPA OWOW to display an exhibit. 	Task 6. Opportunity to interact with students.  EPA will be invited to the Student Career Social where EPA will be recognized.  At this event you will have the opportunity to speak with the students about  careers at EPA. Period of Performance:		Award date to November 7, 2009. Justification of Sole Source to the Estuarine Research Federation Item I: Unique Experience:  The biennial conferences of the Estuarine Research Federation (ERF) are the leaders in international meetings for the exchange of  information among people who work in interdisciplinary and interagency settings and who need to be informed about the latest estuarine research and coastal management issues. The mission of EPA's Coastal Management Branch (CMB) is to protect and maintain coastal watersheds by building  partnerships, strengthening the capacity of our partners, sharing experience broadly and providing leadership and assistance to support community-based watershed management.  To accomplish this, CMB requires expertise on coastal issues.  Also, it is necessary to provide a forum to share this  information with coastal resource managers and other interested entities so that it can be used in the protection and restoration of our nation's coastal watersheds. As the premier professional membership organization focused on estuarine and coastal research, ERF has preeminent status among  professionals in those fields.  EPA requires the services of the Federation because it can pull together the collective expertise of its members including academic, federal, state and private sector leaders in estuarine and coastal issues that influence the sciences management and policy worlds.   ERF has also organized one of the longest running series of estuarine and coastal conferences, beginning with the first conference in 1971. Item II.  Leveraging of Resources:  EPA's participation in the ERF 2009 conference will leverage many more resources and reach many more people than EPA alone  could do.  For instance, the conference will also be supported by other federal agencies, academic institutions nationwide and local private organizations.  Supporting federal agencies include NOAA and USGS.  Regionally, EPA-Atlantic Ecology Division, University of New Hampshire, University of  Maine, University of Rhode Island, Marine Biological Lab, Mass., Battelle Ocean Sciences and many others are providing conference organizing committee chairs and in-kind sponsorships.  Locally, private businesses are donating in-kind services.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) to complete the final Launch on Need (LON) motor set for the Space Shuttle Program.  The motor is required as a companion to one previously procured by the Governmen (to form a matched set). NASA/MSFC intends to acquire this item non-competitively from ATK Launch Systems, Brigham City, Utah, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  ATK is the only source for a large human-rated, reusable solid propellant motor and no other manufacturer exists.	ATK owns the facilities where the Space Shuttle RSRMs are refurbished and manufactured in Utah.  No other facilities exist that can refurbish or manufacture the Space Shuttle RSRM.  In order to support the launch of the Space Shuttle, the motors for each flight must be manufactured in matched pairs so the thrust from each motor is equal.  It is considered impossible for another contractor to build one motor as a companion that could be launched with the ATK motor that is currently under contract.  The production of this motor is required in Government Fiscal Year 2009 to support the Space Shuttle launch manifest.  ATK is the only vendor capable of producing an RSRM within the time constraints. Notification of interest and capability to respond to this requirement should be provided to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the date this synopsis is posted. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This radiation detector allows the user to fully exploit the many different coincidence signatures that radioactive isotopes produce as they decay.  Though the sensor was originally designed for high efficiency radioactive gaseous species detection, small modifications can be made to allow detection of liquid and solid radioactive species as well. The detector is very sensitive due to the high efficiency, and exploitation of the coincidence beta/gamma radiation signature used. As few as 1000 radioactive atoms can be identified using this detector arrangement.  Advantages include (1) a factor of 1000 reduction in ambient background can be achieved over single decay measuring detectors by exploiting the coincidence nuclear decay that most radioactive isotopes emit, (2) the large solid angle of this detector allows nearly 100% detection efficiency for charge particles and >60% efficiency for low energy gamma-rays ( < 150 keV), and (3) the use of highly reliable photomultiplier tubes and rugged scintillation materials allows this detector to be field portable and less expensive than comparable solid state detectors.  A detailed description of the technology is provided in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0085014 A1.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

Standard Commercial Warranty:  The Contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government?s rights under the ?Inspection? clause nor does it limit the Government?s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty.  The standard commercial warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable material and/or services listed in the Schedule.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, has a requirement for Drugs of Abuse Reagent Assay Kits, Calibrators, and Controls for use on the VA owned Olympus AU400e Toxicology Analyzer.  The VAMC Minneapolis is a certified HHS SAMSHA NIDA Laboratory and meets the mandatory guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs.   Assays, calibrators and controls required include:  Amphetamine, Barbiturate, Benzodiazephine, Cocaine, Opiate, Phencyclidine, Methadone, Cannabinoid, and Oxycodone.   All reagents provided must be compatible and certified/approved for use on Olympus AU400e instrumentation for drugs of abuse testing and must provide the highest level possible of precision available for testing in order to meet certification and quality assurance requirements of the VA Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service.  The VAMC Laboratory will consider for use assays using either the CEDIA or EMIT testing process.  For ease of use, the preference is to receive products that are in bar coded containers that can be placed directly onto the analyzer and the barcode will be recognized by the Olympus AU400e analyzer.  It is anticipated that the contract will be for a Base Year plus three 12-month options to renew for a total contract period of four years.  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded.  The FSC Code is 6550 "Invitro Diagnostic Substances, Reagents Test Kits" and the NAICS Code is 325413 In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The intent of this contract action is to provide fish passage through the proj ect by partial removal of a section of the dam or spillway and appropriate routing and treatment of the stream above, below, and through the dam.  Elk Creek Project is located approximately 25 miles north of Medford, Oregon.  Construction of this project w as stopped by court injunction in fiscal year 1987, with the dam at one-third of the design height.  Design Considerations: The routing and treatment of the stream has been designed utilizing hydrologic and geomorphic analysis with fisheries oversight to e nsure the fish passage corridor in the stream  will be as geomorphically stable  as is reasonably possible immediately following construction.

The Contractor will be required to acquire appropriate permits for access and to conduct work in and near water. The in-water work pe riod is June 15 through September 15.  The allowable blasting period is July 15 though January 15.  Some species of fish have been listed and others are proposed for listing as endangered species.  This will require special coordination with the Corps of E ngineers and resource agencies of all potential impacts.  Construction Features:  Based on preliminary design concepts, routing of the stream through the dam will require demolition of  RCC concrete (approx. 60,000 cy) and  conventional concrete (approx. 3 00 cubic yards).  Routing of the stream and local grading will require cut and fill (approx. 341,400 cubic yards) and rock excavation (approx. 1,000 cubic yards).  The length of the affected stream is approximately 5,000 feet.  Bank protection will be requ ired and may include as much as 1,000 cubic yards of revetment.  A stream flow training wall will be required and may include as much as 35,000 cubic yards of revetment and core materials.  River bar materials may be as much as 10,000 cubic yards of native  river gravels.  Some structural and electrical work may be required.  Temporary care and diversion of the stream during construction will be required. A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) shall be provided for all new contracts with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District.

<DESC>A.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is interested in obtaining a contractor who can provide recommendations on how the agency can best meet its document management needs.  It is currently anticipated that the vendor will interview agency stakeholders to identify document management requirements and associated business processes.  The vendor will then advise on requirements feasibility, technical solutions, business process changes and implementation strategy.  


B.  The vendor will need to be able to: 1) Assess FTCs current document management processes (both electronic and paper) and related business processes. 2) Assess FTCs current IT infrastructure and technology as it relates to document management (document creation, storage, searching, etc.). 3) Assess FTC stakeholders requirements and desires for current and future document management (also taking into account applicable statutory/regulatory requirements). 4)Provide FTC management with written recommendations on how to better use current technical resources and additional new tools which need to be purchased to meet current and evolving needs. 5)Provide FTC management with written options and recommendations on end state solutions to best meet FTC requirements and desires.6)Provide FTC management with written recommendations on business process changes to improve efficiency and better enable FTC to meet its goals. 7) Provide FTC management with written recommendations on an implementation strategy.  


C. It is imperative that the vendor be: 1) be product neutral?without a business relationship to any specific solution.  2) Have previous experience analyzing, reviewing, and assessing electronic document management needs and related business processes and recommending solutions.  This experience should include full life cycle cost benefit analysis (acquisition, deployment, operations, maintenance and enhancement).  Experience assessing document management needs and business processes of federal agencies are strongly preferred.


D. In order to ensure that only those vendors who have the capability of providing the services required in paragraph 1, FTC is using the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.202, Advisory Multi-Step Process. The two-phase approach consists of submission of corporate capability statements and possible participation in oral presentations (Phase I), and submission of written technical information and cost/price proposals (Phase II):


1. Phase I:Interested contractors/vendors will provide limited information in response to subparagraph 1 above as follows:


a.Corporate Capability Statement:List of services/products commercially available, or that can be available by the agreed upon contract performance due date, that comply with this pre-solicitation notice. The Corporate Capability Statement shall be no longer than 4 type written pages. 


b.Past Performance Information:The  Company shall provide three references, of which at least 2 will be for contracts that have been completed, complete with company and point of contact name, phone, address, and email for projects of similar scope and size with their package.   The work must be similar in nature to this requirement in scope and must have been completed within the last 3 years. Each reference shall be from different companies. Provide Federal government agency references if available.  The Past Performance Information is not included in the 4 page limitation for submission of corporate capability statements.



c.Confirmation of the vendor's availability to participate in Oral Presentations. Oral presentations may be required; however it is at the FTC's discretion.  Oral presentations are an informal discussion between the vendor and the government. No discussion of cost will be allowed at this phase; 


1) Oral presentations are anticipated to be held during the week of October 22nd - 26th.Invitees will be given morning and afternoon options for presentation times. Invitees may participate either on-site at FTC Headquarters, or via telephone; 


2)Oral presentations will be limited to 2 hours in length and the vendor should expect to answer technical questions regarding the vendor's planned approach, experience, success stories of similar project, etc.



3)The vendor's key personnel (i.e., subject matter experts) responsible for potential project development shall participate in the oral presentations. 


Although the FTC may not require Oral Presentations it is a response requirement that the vendor acknowledge the will be available during the time stipulated, in case the FTC chooses to hold oral presentations.


2.Phase II: The FTC shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated above, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that they will be invited to submit written technical information and a cost/price proposal or, based on the information submitted during Phase I, that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. The FTC shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion and state that notwithstanding the advice provided by the FTC in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.


3. Only those parties who submit corporate capability statements, past performance information, and respond affirmatively that they would be available for potential oral presentations will be eligible to move through the proposal process.


4. Corporate capability statements, past performance information and confirmation of availability of vendor to participate in oral presentations are due to the Contracting Officer no later than 12:00 PM EST, Monday, October 15, 2007. Responses shall be sent via email to bzieman@ftc.gov.
