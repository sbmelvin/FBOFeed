It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firms listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground Natick Division (ACC-APG-NCD) is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W911QY-13-R-0012, for the delivery of a current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) multivalent filovirus vaccine using the Virus Like Particle (VLP) platform will be issued on or about 31 January 2013 with an anticipated contract award on or about 15 Jul 2013.  This is a total small business set-aside competition and all responsible or qualified sources are eligible to compete.  <br> In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested contractors shall be registered in the SAM database.  SAM registration can be accomplished at the following website:  https://www.sam.gov. The North American Industry Classification Platform (NAICS) codes for this procurement are 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology.  The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.   <br> The Government intends to serve as the regulatory sponsor and platform integrator for this effort. <br> The objective of this procurement is to deliver, after limited advance development, a current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) multivalent filovirus vaccine using the VLP platform that will be suitable/acceptable for use in humans by the Government to support non-clinical and Phase 1 studies under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The manufacturer shall develop, abide by and document cGMP and processes consistent with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q7and ICH Q5A- Q5E, FDA regulation 21 CFR Part 211 21 CFR Part 600.   <br> In addition to delivering a cGMP final vaccine product to support clinical and nonclinical efforts, the Contractor shall conduct formulation studies to support the development of a filovirus vaccine as well as analytical assay development, including in-process and release assays of cGMP bulk(s) and final product, and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-compliant stability testing.  Formulation studies will include exploration of adjuvants. The intended product is a subunit, vector-free, multivalent vaccine consisting of multiple VLPs each expressing two antigens, glycoprotein (GP) and a matrix protein (VP40) of the filovirus strains. The VLPs are spontaneously produced in cells when the two genes encoding GP and VP40 are expressed ectopically. These VLPs have a morphology that is strikingly similar to the authentic filovirus with the GP expressed on the surface, traversing the envelope and a layer of matrix protein (VP40) underneath the envelope.  <br> Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the  quote mark Best Value quote mark  to the Government.  Delivery schedules of the vaccine product shall be proposed by the offerors and will be used as one of the criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation. The proposed schedule calling for delivery of the Multivalent Filovirus Vaccine, as described above, is anticipated within 3 to 4 years after contract award, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  Interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 31 January 2013 at the FedBizOpps website hyperlink https://www.fbo.gov/.  Search on solicitation number W911QY-13-R-0012.  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of NATO-Wide Secure Voice Services / Voice over Secure IP (SVoS / VoSIP) capabilities.
<p>The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Please note, however, that for the performance of the contract, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13572-SVS. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF PROJECT</p>
<p>The project will provide NATO-wide SVoS / VoSIP that is compliant with the NGCS Target Architecture and the NATO Secure Voice Strategy.</p>
<p>The VoSIP capability needs to be operational, maintainable, reliable, secure, easy to manage, and scalable. It will include the following components:</p>
<p>a. The IPBX IP (Internet Protocol) PBX (Private Branch Exchange, one main in SHAPE and one alternate in Brunssum) is the business telephone system designed to deliver voice over a data network and is interoperable with the normal Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Its basic functions include establishment of calls, maintaining calls, disconnection of calls, and metering.<br />b. The Voice Access Nodes (VoAN) provide access from the terminals to the IPBX. They come in three sizes (small, medium, and large) and the determination of the relevant size depends on the size of the site and the number of users.<br />c. The VoSIP terminals<br />d. Reference systems (Training and Troubleshooting)</p>
<p>The project shall be implemented in two stages, consisting of implementation of an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) four months in duration and implementation of a Final Operational Capability (FOC) six months in duration.</p>
<p>The VTC capability will be centrally managed through the installed VNOC, which will allow the VNOC operations in SHAPE to exercise control of all configurations, operational and troubleshooting activities required.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from the DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 22 January 2013<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued in February 2013</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for April 2013</p>
<p>- Contract Award expected in the third quarter of 2013</p>

<p>The availability of the fully functional core infrastructure for both NU and NS networks is critical for the operational effectiveness of ACT Norfolk.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE</p>
<p>The full scope of this project is proposed to be procured through a single contract using BOA Plus procedures and lowest compliant bid.</p>
<p>This project is to procure and implement the replacement of failing and obsolete equipment on the LAN infrastructure supporting the NU and NS networks at HQ SACT in Norfolk VA.<br />NCIA Sector Norfolk, which is responsible for the operational CIS support for ACT, requires fully functional and supported hardware and software to maintain the expected availability of functional services being used by HQ SACT in line with the required service level.</p>
<p>The project covers the need for replacement of LAN core switches, data storage (disk storage), and protection services (tape storage) for the HQ SACT command to maintain IT services availability.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from the DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 16 January 2013<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued in February 2013</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for March 2013</p>
<p>- Contract Award expected in April 2013</p>

Reponses will not be accepted after the due date. Faxed information will not be considered. BLS will not accept phone calls regarding this notice.

<p><br />Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Administration <br />GSA Schedule Sole Source Task Order <br />For Acquisition Management System Customization Services<br />1. Identification of the agency and the contacting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Sole Source Bridge Contract."</p>
<p>a. Agency: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Administration, Divisions of <br />Administrative Services and Information Systems (DAS and DIS) Room 1830<br />b. Contracting Bureau of Labor Statistics; Division of Administrative Services<br />Activity: Branch of Procurement, Property, and Contract Management; Room 1830</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>This action approves and justifies the issuance of a Sole Source GSA schedule task order issued to large business Compusearch Software Systems Inc., as a follow-on to the Department of Labor's award for a new acquisition management system (AMS) with this vendor. BLS has specific customization needs beyond the scope of DOL's awarded contract, namely the incorporation of an interface with the new AMS and the BLS MIS checkbook for accounting and budgeting purposes. The period of performance will be a base period of one year from the date of award for the initial programming and implementation of the customized interface, with four one year option years for continued maintenance.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>a. Description of the supplies or services.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses an in-house application, BLS Checkbook, to monitor funds balances and to record commitment and obligation information at a more detailed level than the Accounting Line level. BLS uses the BLS Checkbook to establish individual "pots of funds," each one identified by a unique four-digit "Control Number," at the BLS Program (Activity), Cost Center, and MIS Object Class level. The MIS Object Class is a BLS-determined roll up of DOL Object Class. The Control Number is a sequential number generated prior to or during a fiscal year to identify these individual pots of funds. The Control Number balance equals the current operating budget for the Control Number minus all existing commitments against it.</p>
<p>The purposes of the BLS Checkbook are to record "charges" against the operating budgets of individual Control Numbers, to provide users information on the remaining balances, and to prevent overcharges. For that reason, within the BLS Checkbook, a Commitment and an Obligation is treated in the same way: as a "charge" against (that is, a subtraction of funds from) the operating budget of a Control Number. Whether it is a Commitment or an Obligation in the DOL Procurement System, it is always referred to as a Commitment in the BLS Checkbook.</p>
<p>The DOL Procurement System must interface with the BLS Checkbook via a BLS Web Service. When a BLS user is processing a procurement action in the Procurement System the Procurement System must invoke the BLS Web Service at specific points during the processing of the procurement action. This is so that the BLS Web Service can perform BLS-specific functionality such as the following examples:</p>
<p>&bull; Present information to the Procurement System user, prompt the user for response(s), and accept the user response(s) (such as a user selection from a list of values).</p>
<p>&bull; Provide Control Numbers and their real-time balances to the Procurement System user in response to certain user entries/selections.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a real-time funds check against the BLS Checkbook to verify that a user-selected Control Number has a sufficient balance for the procurement action before the funds are committed or obligated. This funds checking process is in addition to the approval process that is standard for DOL.</p>
<p>&bull; Providing Accounting Line segments to the Procurement System for assignment on the user's procurement action.</p>
<p>&bull; Send commitment and obligation information to the BLS Checkbook upon each successful funds check.</p>
<p><br />4. The authority and supporting rationale (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i) and (b)(1)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.</p>
<p>a. Authority</p>
<p>FAR Par 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(b) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>

<DESC><p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor will utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remit those payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations with respect to appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) which will educate providers with respect to the Medicare program; will respond to provider telephone and written inquiries; will respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and will make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of provider services, such as enrollment of new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers with respect to Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction J (which includes the states of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee) on or about January 18, 2013. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is March 7, 2013 with an anticipated award date of August 30, 2013.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source to iLab Solutions, LLC, for core subscriptions to Software as a Service<br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the NHLBI, Division of Intramural Research, intends to negotiate and award a contract or purchase order for core subscriptions to Software as a Service to iLab Solutions, LLC, 177 Hudson Street, Somerville, MA 02144 .<br />BACKGROUND:<br />The mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. Core Facilities within the NHLBI DIR feature a technology, an approach, or a group of related technologies designed to support the research in the NHLBI DIR community and provide services that are not readily or conveniently available from outside vendors. Core Facilities arise based on needs articulated in the NHLBI DIR, and they are transformed or eliminated when the need no longer exists. In 2011, the Office of the Scientific Director within the NHLBI DIR procured and implemented iLab Solutions, a Software as a Service (SaaS), to support and enhance the daily operations (scheduling, request tracking, inventory management, and billing) for approximately 13 diverse Core Facilities, and to assist the administration in tracking and reporting on Core Facility usage. During the first year, iLab was integrated with NIH enterprise directory (NED), and an NHLBI implementation of iLab was customized for the workflow of each of the 13 Core Facilities, and Core Directors and users were trained on how to use the customized iLab software to schedule, request, track inventory, and bill for services. <br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br />The period of performance will consist of a twelve (12) month base period followed by four (04) consecutive twelve (12) twelve month option periods.<br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br />This is a follow-on requirement, wherein the contractor shall provide core subscriptions to iLab's software as a service including software licenses, implementation, user directory integration, version upgrades and feature enhancements, hosting, unlimited user support, and 5 hours of custom coding per Core Facility. <br />Software as a Service includes software licenses, version upgrades and feature enhancements, hosting, unlimited user support, and 5 hours of custom coding per Core Facility. DIR also requires continued integration with NIH enterprise directory (NED). The contractor will provide user analytics at the completion of each period of 12 months, to be submitted within 15 days of the end of the reporting period. User analytics should include a list of registered users, and number of user requests tracked per user. This report will also provide an assessment of user requests made directly to iLab.<br />SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:<br />During the period of Oct 1, 2011-Sept 30, 2012, NHLBI DIR, under contract No HHSN268201100450P, worked with iLab to customize software. This included integration with NIH enterprise directory (NED), customization to match financial system for billing, thirteen (13) NHLBI DIR core facilities worked intensively with iLab to customize iLab to match core facility workflows for user request management. This represented a considerable level of effort on the part of our core facility staff, as well as in training and adjustment for our user base, in addition to a cost of $25,000 for customization.<br />When this contract was initially awarded, it was determined that iLab Solutions was the best value based on an open competition. Renewing the contract will enable the lab to maintain consistent and uniform data results and streamline laboratory operational procedures conducted at no cost for additional staff training. There are currently no other manufacturers and resellers of this product. This product can not be replaced without another expensive investment in product analysis, training and implementation. The cost and time required for a new manufacturer to install a new system is not in the best interest of the government. <br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY:<br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1(b), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541513 and the Size Standard is $25.5M. <br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />The determination by the Government to award a contract or purchase order on a noncompetitive, sole source basis for a Software as a Service Subscription to iLab Solutions, LLC is based upon the responses to the sources sought synopsis published in the FedBizOpps on December 19, 2012. Information received as a result of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.<br />

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit proposals from offerors having the capability to act as a centralized laboratory to carry out validated quantitative and/or qualitative assays for a variety of compounds in biological specimens collected from preclinical and clinical studies. The data obtained will be used by NIDA to support the development of new medications for the treatment of drug addiction. The laboratory must be able to perform the tasks listed below:
<p>1. Quantitative assay for samples collected from metabolic, pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies:</p>
<p>The laboratory must be able to perform quantitative assays for samples collected from preclinical metabolic and pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies, as well as samples collected from all phases of clinical studies. The analytes include, but are not limited to, potential therapeutic compounds and/their metabolites, abused drugs and/their metabolites, concomitant medications/compounds, and endogenous substances (e.g. proteins, enzymes etc). Sample matrices include biological fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, etc) and tissues (liver, brain, hair etc). The analytical laboratory must be able to develop and validate new assay methods for drugs/metabolites for which established assays do not exist. The analytes may appear in biological matrices at concentrations of low ng/mL or subnanogram/mL and therefore require the use of state of the art analytical methods including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and immunoassays.</p>
<p>2. Assay for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers (protein, enzymes, etc.):</p>
<p>The laboratory must be able to perform assays for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers for the assessment of efficacy and safety of study medications in clinical trials. Monitoring of abused drugs in biological fluids serves as a surrogate outcome measure for assessing drug use in clinical trials. The abused drugs include, but are not limited to, cocaine/benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), methamphetamine, amphetamine, morphine (or morphine-glucuronide), cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines. Automated qualitative/semi-quantitative immunoassays are generally used for screening of abused drugs in biological fluids, primarily in urine. Validated quantitative methods using GC-MS or LC-MS are generally required for confirmatory/quantitative assay for samples which showed positive for screening. Immunoassays are generally required for quantitative assay of molecular biomarkers.</p>
<p>3. Sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices:</p>
<p>The laboratory is required to supply clinical sites with sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices for screening of abused drugs.</p>
<p>The methods for quantitative assays must be validated for reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the concentration ranges required for the preclinical and clinical studies. The laboratory must follow appropriate Food and Drug Administration guidance regarding assay validation and the assay must be carried out in compliance with pertinent current Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The laboratory must have automated equipment for handling sample preparation and injection as well as computer software for data acquisition and report generation. The laboratory must also have sufficient resources to ensure high throughput of samples and must provide secured facilities appropriate for storing biological samples and analytical data as well as computerized systems for tracking samples.</p>
<p>In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that the successful offeror possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Registration for Chemical Analysis or DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V controlled substances and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of a single, five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) task order contract. NIDA may award either cost reimbursement and/or fixed price task orders under this contract. NIDA anticipates that at least one task order will be awarded with the initial contract.</p>
<p>RFP No. N01DA-13-8910 will be available electronically on or about January 18, 2013. You will be able to access the RFP through FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following URL: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps). All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due on or about 45 days after release of the RFP. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

The work includes, but is not limited to, providing all management, supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to provide services for: General Information, Management and Administration, Housing (Family and Bachelor), Facility Support (Facility Investment, Custodial, Pest Control, Integrated Solid Waste Management, Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping, Pavement Clearance) and Base Support Vehicles and Equipment.
  The work will be accomplished under a combination Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  The contract term will be a base period with a potential of four one-year option periods.  If a follow-on contract is not awarded on time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period of up to six months in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999).  The NAICS code for this procurement is 561210, Facility Support Services with a size standard of $35.5 million.

This contract will replace contract, N33191-09-D-0103, for similar services awarded in 2007.  Information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.
  Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for the information.

The anticipated date of RFP issuance is on or about 18 January 2013.  Proposal due date will be on or about 19 February 2013.  

Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it becomes available. Notices, amendments and responses to RFIs will also be posted to https://www.neco.navy.mil/.   All prospective offerors are encouraged to register at https://www.neco.navy.mil/. This is the method that will be utilized for distributing amendments and other information to offerors.  It is the offerors responsibility to check the website frequently for any amendments to the solicitation.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and corporate experience information, along with a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.
  The tradeoff process is anticipated to be used for this acquisition.  The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will require the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors: 

	Factor 1  Corporate Experience
	Factor 2  Technical Approach/Management Approach
	Factor 3  Safety 
	Factor 4  Past Performance

The anticipated relative order of importance of the non-price evaluation factor is the technical factors Factors 1, 2, and 3 are of equal importance to each other and, when combined are equal in importance to Factor 4, past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment.
  Technical factors (Factors 1-3) and the past performance/performance confidence assessment factor (Factor 4) combined are approximately equal to price. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  In addition, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award of the contract.
  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government.  The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov.  Reference is made to FAR 52.204-99 (Dev), System for Award Management Registration (AUG 2012)(Deviation).  You are encouraged to register as soon as possible.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS DESCRIPTION:

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), intends to amend contract award N61331-12-C-0022, a commercial Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Ocenco Incorporated (Ocenco), 10225 82nd Avenue, Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158-5800, to add option period four for the acquisition of approximately 6,000 Emergency Escape Breathing Devices (EEBDs).  This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition because the Ocencos EEBD is currently the only NIOSH-approved device that meets U.S. Navy stowage and use requirements.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the Government.

The basis for award is fair and reasonable price.
  Period of performance is 30 months from contract award.  Award will be on or about 16 Nov 2012.

NAICS Code:  	339113

SBA Size Standard:  500 employees

The following are items for repair: COMPRESSOR VANE, NSN 2840-003263690, P/N 740552CL30, est. 63ea ea;  COMPRESSOR VANE, NSN 2840-003263689, P/N 740552CL31, est. 123ea; COMPRESSOR VANE, NSN 2840-003263688,P/N 740552CL32, est. 6007ea;  COMPRESSOR VANE, NSN 2840-01-068-3294, P/N 740552CL33, 5347ea; COMPRESSOR VANE, NSN 2840-010674486 P/N 740552CL34, 6405ea; COMPRESSOR VANE, NSN 2840 010683295 P/N 740552CL35, est. 8745ea.  This synopsis is for the establishment of a repair requirements contract for J52 Compressor Vanes. The solicitation will be issued with three base years and 2 one-year option periods executable at the Governments discretion. The total quantity for each NSN is the estimated quantity to be repaired over 5 years. The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">T-1A Aircraft Sustainment<br /><br />Sources Sought/Request for Information<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, which, as part of market research, is being issued in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation/request for proposal and no contract shall be resultant from this synopsis. There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to Mr. Jason Shirazi, email jason.shirazi@tinker.af.mil, fax: (405)739-5451 or address: OC-ALC/GKSKA 3001 Staff Drive STE 1AE1-103C, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020. All responses should be received NLT 2:00 PM CST 04 February 2013. All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center's Contract Logistics Support Branch is seeking to identify sources that are capable of providing sustainment solutions and potential energy efficiencies to the T-1A.</p>
<p>Background<br />The T-1A is a Commercial Derivative Aircraft derived from a Beech 400A and is FAR Part 25 certified (Type Certificate Data Sheet A16SW) used to train Air Force pilots. Each T-1A is powered by two each JT15D-5D Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (PWC). It is the intent of the USAF to maintain the Type Certificate and any future Supplemental TCs (STCs). The USAF has 178 active T-1A aircraft at the following bases: Vance AFB, Randolph AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB and NAS Pensacola.</p>
<p>Description:<br />The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413, size standard 1,000 employees. Major logistics elements will include, but are not limited to, provide solutions to sustain the T-1A through CY2032. Solutions should address, at a minimum; obsolete avionics, powerplant enhancements - providing cost benefits such as: fuel consumption reduction, extended overhaul interval, and reduction of overhaul cost. All aircraft modifications will require Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification.</p>
<p>Sources Sought: <br />The USG is seeking potential sources to provide sustainment solutions for the T-1A Aircraft in the following categories:</p>
<p>Avionics: <br />T-1A currently utilizes a ProLine 4 avionics suite which is experiencing obsolescence concerns in no less than four known systems that include, but are not limited to; Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Maintenance Diagnostic Computer (MDC), Flux Detectors, and Multi-Function Displays (MFD). Additionally, in order to sustain the T-1A to CY2032, any solution should address the FAA mandated to incorporate ADS-B out by 2020. The USG is seeking to interface this aging aircraft with modern avionics.</p>
<p>Engines: <br />Engine benefits are to be focused on the reduction of costs associated with operation and overhaul of the current JT15D engines or the replacement thereof.</p>
<p>Services Questions:<br />1.) How will the proposed solution mitigate known obsolescence concerns? <br />2.) Do you believe you can provide these services in their entirety? If so, what would your approach be to overcoming the proprietary data issue? <br />3.) How long will the development and certification take?<br />4.) What would be the Aircraft throughput per month/year for accomplishing the modification? <br />5.) Where will the modification take place? Will this facility obtain FAA Part 145 certification? <br />6.) Will the proposed solution create any obsolescence issues in the next 20 years to the current configuration?</p>
<p>Small Business Questions:<br />1.) What types of opportunities are available for small business, by function, for this effort? <br />2.) What teaming arrangements (if any) are, or can be, established to help develop small business for this level of effort?<br />Other Market Research Information:<br />1.) Identify relevant contractor experience concerning efforts similar to the one requested in the last 5 years.<br /><br />Potential Industry Day:<br />The government may conduct an industry day to field questions from potential sources. The government will not provide any compensation for travel to or from this informational meeting, or any other costs associated with the attendance. The date/location of this meeting will be posted on fbo.gov if the meeting is to occur.</p>

This is not a Solicitation Announcement and is not a Request for Proposals; and does not obligate the Government to any contract award. The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified Small Business Administration (SBA) certified: 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB)  firms relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). The Small Business Size Standard is $25 million. The Government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision about soliciting this project as either a competitive Set-Aside or full and open competition as Unrestricted; or to proceed with this project as a negotiated sole source procurement. <br>  <br> Award of a single contract consisting of a base year and two option years is anticipated. The incumbent contractor is Xotech L.L.C., Tyrone GA. The current order number is W911SE-08-F-0207, awarded under GSA.    <br>  <br> PROJECT INFORMATION:  <br> The scope of work involves providing the USARC a web based means to interface and manage the excess for the Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS) system in order to provide a management capability for the command and staff.  The units use these STAMIS on a daily basis to provide information that feeds the army database upon which decisions about unit value, modernization, and relevance are based.   <br>  <br> The dwindling availability of resources has dramatically increased the need for data from many sources, databases, multiple organizations and information sources enabling the USARC to manage their supplies and financial process effectively.  These types of data are not currently available in any one standard system.  Once of the many missions of the USARC G4 Distribution Management Center (DMC) is to manage Class VII end items throughout the command, and ensure that excess items are cross-leveled/laterally transferred across the command.

Some broadcasting activities require working irregular hours - such as very early in the morning or late in the evening - depending on the broadcasting schedule. 5) Videotape editor candidates should have at least two (2) years experience as a videotape editor in either a commercial or Government television production facility, utilizing modern computerized editing systems and videotape machines. 6) Free-lance assignments are contracted for strictly on an "as needed" basis. The VOA and OCB make no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive. 7) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors performed work to insure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements.
<p><strong><br />Contractors should note that all work shall be performed in accordance with the standards prescribed in the attached "VOA Journalistic Code". Failure to comply with these legally mandated standards may result in immediate termination of the contract for default. </strong></p>

<DESC>**PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT FOR COMPLETE RFI**<br />PMO: Office of the Chief Medical Officer
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is to gather material on requirements for developing or adopting a dynamic Health and Wellness Assessment (HWA) that is accessible to all Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries.  The HWA should have a standardized, evidence-based, core question set that will facilitate the ability of the Military Health System (MHS) to assess the health, wellness and at-risk behaviors of its beneficiaries.  Data sources include: self-reported information and biometric data from the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and eventually the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR), other possible sources (e.g. - mobile apps) and data captured from purchased care.  Collated information sources will be assessed and beneficiaries will receive an online "Well-Being Plan," in addition to a medical team, which has not only been specifically designated to them, but which should also receive this plan at the point of care (POC).  The Well-Being Plan consists of a personalized summary of the overall well-being of each beneficiary, and offers actionable steps that can be taken to improve well-being.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should provide an understanding of existing capabilities, performance outcomes from previous experience, rough magnitude of schedule and variables which could impact schedule.  Furthermore, responses should include a description of services, amenable contract structures and any unique requirements not addressed in this RFI.</p>

The primary goal of maintenance is the suppression and elimination of exotic and invasive plant species so that beneficial, native species will flourish.  Invasive native species will be controlled in order to maintain an esthetically pleasing and natural look around the lakes.  Please note that some vegetation like Water Primrose, Cattails and Brazilian Pepper require many months to decompose.  Unless otherwise noted, it is vendor's responsibility to remove this dead plant material.  In addition, please be aware that some plant species are much more difficult to control, sometimes taking several months of treatment.  Preserve management involves suppression and elimination of exotic and invasive plant species so that beneficial, native species will flourish.  Vegetation is left in place unless otherwise noted.  Some vegetation, like Water Primrose, Cattails, Melaleuca and Brazilian Pepper require many months or years to decompose.   All exotic plants will be treated with EPA approved herbicides. 

During the months of October, November, December, January, February and March, weed control to the lake will be performed monthly and during the months of April, May, June, July, August and September weed control will be accomplished twice per month. This will include the maintenance of all existing noxious aquatic weeds growing in the waterways, including the alligator weed along the edge of the entire lake. When performing weed and algae control, the Contractor will spray to deter unwanted growth. Contractor will be responsible for removal of unwanted weeds which includes gathering up and removing from pond and removing from station. All chemicals used for weed and algae control will be in accordance with all local/state and federal guidelines.

5.  WATER TESTING:

Monthly water testing will be conducted to check the saline level of the lake. The water used for testing will be taken from the PVC piping hooked up to the pumps from the underground well. All readings will be sent to the designated COTR; Donnell Singleton. If water restrictions are required after treatment Contractor shall post signs and notify the Bay Pines COTR. It will be Bay Pines' responsibility to maintain the posted signs throughout the required period.

6.  FOUNTAINS AND IRRIGATION:

Fountains will be cleaned and maintained monthly (approximately every 30 days) and be free of all debris. This includes cleaning of the pump intake screens, scrape, clean and polish the lights, clean all surface of the float and cleaning each part and disassembly of parts (heads, jets & rings), as needed and to clean orifice impediments.

The Contractor will provide loaner equipment for major breakdowns or breakdowns where parts are unavailable due to backorder situations.  The Contractor, if required, and available to the Contactor, will furnish a loan of the same type of equipment, without additional cost to the Government.  Loaned equipment must be equal to or superior to equipment removed from the premises.

7.  STOCKING OF LAKE:

Preventive steps will be taken to prevent future algae or weed outbreaks and will include supplying Carp, Catfish, and Brim to help keep the growth in control. The size and depth of the lake will determine the quantities, size and variety of fish to be stocked. Restocking of the lake will be determined by the attributes of the lake but no less than once per year. All fees, permits and compliance with Federal and local laws, proper license and certificates will be the responsibility of the Contractor.  Vendor shall remove, free of additional charges, fish that are killed due to periodic treatments.  Fish that are killed due to natural causes (e.g. algae bloom) or other causes (e.g. pesticide or lawn service poisoning) shall be removed and invoiced separately upon approval of COTR. 

8.  WATER RESTRICTIONS:
Vendor treatments will rarely be subject to water use restrictions.  Bay Pines VAHCS will provide a point of contact (POC) to coordinate all communications between vendor and client.  The vendor shall notify the POC if it will become necessary to restrict any water use.

VISN 19 - Rocky Mountain Network
 Emergency Prescription Services

I.	Overview
a.	Introduction/Background
(1)	Per VHA Handbook 1108.05, Section 8a - Supplemental (Emergent Need) and Fee-Basis Pharmacy Services:
(a)	Every effort must be made to utilize VA pharmacies for prescription services. When appropriate, arrangements can be made for emergency prescription services through a community pharmacy or the Fee Basis program. In these instances, the patient must not incur additional expense. These arrangements are to be made on a selective, individual patient basis, after careful determination of the type and recurring nature of the prescription. Any pharmacy licensed by a state, commonwealth, or territory of the United States is eligible to accept and fill prescriptions for VA patients, when required and approved in accordance with current VHA policy. 

b.	Scope
(1)	This contract is to provide financial management services to ensure reimbursement of emergent fill pharmacy benefits.  The contract is between VHA, as a health plan, and the contractor, for the purpose of reimbursing the contractor a set price for prescriptions filled at the Veteran's request for which the Veteran was not charged.  It is not a contract for the purpose of filling prescriptions or dispensing medications.  It is a financial management services contract.
(2)	The contractor shall provide emergent pharmaceutical products and services throughout VISN 19 to Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), Primary Care Telehealth Outreach Clinics (PCTOCs), Outreach Clinics, and VA-affiliated Nursing Homes as listed on : http://www2.va.gov/directory/guide/region.asp?ID=19   as outlined below:

A new prescription is defined as a written prescription for a drug product and strength that has not been previously dispensed to the beneficiary in the previous 12 months.  A repeat order for the same drug product within 12 months, even if transmitted as a new prescription order, is not considered a new prescription.  In rare instances (i.e. hurricanes or other natural disaster) where refills may be necessary there must be a pre-authorization by the Clinic Consultant (or designee) at the cognizant VA Medical Center Pharmacy and so noted on the invoice.  Exceptions may be made for second courses of antibiotic therapy.

3)	Only prescriptions from VA authorized practitioners shall be filled under the contract.  Prescriptions will be written on VA prescription form 10-2577F, Security Prescription Form, or locally developed prescription blanks and hand carried by the beneficiary, faxed from a VA clinic practitioner, given verbally by a VA Clinic practitioner, or stamped with the words "Authorized VA Emergent Prescription".  Prescriptions from non-VA authorized practitioners shall not be filled under the contract.
4)	Emergent Drug List
a)	Prescriptions reimbursed through the financial management services for emergent fill pharmacy benefits contract will be limited to medications of urgent need as determined by VA clinical staff and will follow safe and effective formulary management principles practiced within the VA.  The adjudication of medications on a case-by-case basis must follow the local medical center procedure.  The VISN 19 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Committee shall develop a list of emergent drugs that can be reimbursed for under the contract without prior authorization.  The Chair, VISN 19 PBM Committee or designee will email this "emergent drug list" to the contractor at the time of contract award and provide updates to the list as necessary.  Generic drugs shall be used whenever available.   All medicines reimbursed for under this contract must meet FDA standards.
b)	Prescriptions shall be filled for legend drugs listed on the VA VISN 19 Emergent Drug List.  The Contractor shall review all prescriptions to ensure that the product listed on the emergent formulary.  The VA reserves the right to add or delete drugs from the emergent formulary at any time.

5)	Prescriptions for VA Nursing Home Care patients residing at the Miles City, Montana VA Nursing Home Care Unit and Pueblo, Colorado VA Nursing Home Care Unit are an exception to the emergent formulary and may have prescriptions filled for any product contained on the VA National Formulary.  VA practitioners will indicate on the prescription orders that the prescription is for a nursing home resident.  A copy of the VA National Formulary will be provided to the contractor, and can be located at (http://www.pbm.va.gov/NationalFormulary.aspx)
6)	Any other exceptions to the prescription requirements of the contract must be pre-authorized by the respective Clinic Consultant at the responsible VA Medical Center (see http://www2.va.gov/directory/guide/region.asp?ID=19 ).

(e)	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the  contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
(f)	 If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
(g)	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
(h)	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

(j)	The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than _7___ days. 
(k)	When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within __7__ days.
(l)	All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.
(5)	INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
(a)	For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerablity scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
(b)	Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
(c)	Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
(d)	The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
(e)	The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
(f)	VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
(g)	All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
(h)	Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
1)	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
2)	VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
3)	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
4)	Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
a)	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
b)	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
(6)	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
(a)	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
(b)	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
(c)	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
(d)	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
(7)	LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
(a)	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
(b)	The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
(c)	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
1)	Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
2)	Description of the event, including:
a)	date of occurrence;
b)	data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
3)	Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
4)	Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
5)	Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
6)	Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
7)	The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
8)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
9)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
10)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
11)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
(d)	Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50__ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
1)	Notification;
2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
3)	Data breach analysis;
4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
6)	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
(8)	SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
(a)	On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.
(9)	TRAINING
(a)	All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
1)	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
2)	Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
3)	Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
4)	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
(b)	The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
(c)	Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<DESC><strong>This is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a short-term sole source contract to ensure continuity of complex critical services pending completion of a competitive acquisition.<br /></strong><br />The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research requires a short-term, sole-source "bridge" contract with Information System Laboratories (ISL), Inc., of Rockville, Maryland for them to continue to perform&nbsp;TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine (TRACE) code and model development, and improvements, as well as configuration control, correction of code errors, documentation updates, and user support to the NRC, its contractors, and members of Code Applications and Maintenance Program (CAMP) and the domestic User Support Group for TRACE.&nbsp; The contractor will be required to provide&nbsp;configuration control, correction of code errors, code maintenance, documentation updates, and user support to the NRC, its contractors, and members of CAMP and the domestic User Support Group for RELAP5. &nbsp;TRACE is a three dimensional (3D) code capable of modeling the reactor core and includes 3D kinetics.&nbsp; It is the result of the consolidation of several earlier thermal-hydraulic (T/H) and neutronics codes. RELAP5 is a one-dimensional (1D) best-estimate T/H code that is primarily used for small-break loss of coolant accidents (SBLOCAs) and other transients. In addition, the contractor will also be required to maintain the NRC Reactor Safety Databank, provide CAMP program management support, and organize and conduct TRACE and/or RELAP5 training workshops to NRC staff and external code users.&nbsp; The contract will support the Agency's safety mission by providing high-quality and timely regulatory research, tools, expertise and other technical products that facilitate regulatory decision making and system safety. <br /><br />Presently, the aforementioned services are being provided to NRC by ISL under NRC Contract No. NRC-04-07-048 which&nbsp;expires on February 5, 2013.&nbsp; Proposals received for the competitive&nbsp;follow-on acquisition to that contract (Solicitation No. RS-RES-12-110) are currently under evaluation by NRC; however, because of a number of factors that have significantly complicated the evaluation of proposals, award of a contract resulting from that solicitation cannot be made before the current contract with ISL expires on February 5, 2013.<br /><br />The period of performance for the bridge contract will&nbsp;be six (6) months, starting on February 6, 2013, through August 5, 2013, plus one six-month option to extend the term of the contract if that should become necessary.&nbsp; The bridge contract will include the clause at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.237-3, Continuity of Services and the clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services in case either of those clauses are needed. 3.<br /><br />This bridge contract acquisition&nbsp;will be&nbsp;conducted under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(b)(1) which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy NRC's requirements.<br /><br />ISL&nbsp;has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently being performed under NRC-04-07-048 while the competitive follow-on acquisition is completed and awaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;ISL is the only source that can seamlessly perform those requirements while NRC completes its evaluation and award process for the follow-on acquisition.&nbsp; It is not feasible to award a new contract to provide the required support between now and award of the follow-on contract for the following reasons:<br /><br />&nbsp;-&nbsp;A&nbsp;new contractor&nbsp;would require several months to be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;comply with NRC Security standards.&nbsp; All contractor personnel&nbsp;with access to NRC thermal-hydraulic computer codes must be granted IT Level 2 access by NRC before they can access those codes, and that security&nbsp;process typically takes several months.<br /><br />&nbsp;- It would not be cost effective for the NRC to negotiate and award the short-term bridge contract with any source besides ISL.&nbsp; If NRC were to do so, NRC would incur tens of thousands of dollars in transition costs for personnel and IT infrastructure (source code, website database, experimental data, training materials, etc.), and those costs may very well have to be incurred yet again after the award of Solicitation No. RS-RES-12-110.&nbsp; That duplication of costs could not be recovered by NRC through competition or any other means.<br /><br />For the reasons noted above, NRC intends to award the short-term bridge contract to ISL to ensure that NRC is able to meet its mission without any lapse in critical services while it completes the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition.

<DESC>1. Introduction  1.1. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacfic  (SSC Pacific) is seeking information regarding the replacement of  the . AN/TSQ-216 Environmental Control Unit (ECU) 1.2. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, the Navy is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor that web site for additional information pertaining to this RFI or a requirement that may relate to this RFI. 2. Background  2.1. The Navy is contemplating  a replacement Environmental Control Unit (ECU) for the AN/TSQ-216 Remote Landing Site Tower (RLST).  The RLST is a world-wide deployable asset that provides Visual Flight Rules (VFR) control of military aircraft at Forward Operating Bases, Forward Air Refueling and Rearming Points and other such rudimentary landing zones.  The RLST consists of a portable air traffic control operations shelter that sits in the back of a HMMWV and a trailer that carries's communications and power generating equipment.  The RLST is self contained in that its power is provided either by portable generators that are part of the system or the 24 VDC of the HMMWV and the ECU must function in either power environment. The ECU provides heating and cooling functions for the RLST in all weather conditions and is currently mounted on the roof of the operations shelter.  2.2.  The specifications for the ECU are attached and the replacement system must be able to fit within the confines of the RLST while it is in transportation mode.  The ECU does not have to be roof mounted if a solution is available that meets size and weight restrictions contained in the specification sheet. An additional information sheet is provided to assist in calculating heat loads for the windows in the RLST using a lat/long location of Yuma, Arizona.  Yuma is the hottest garrison location of the AN/TSQ-216 RLST.  3. Responses:  3.1. Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper not to exceed 10 pages. White papers shall be submitted in Microsoft Word .doc or .docx formats, Times New Roman 11-point or 12-point font, with 1-inch margins, minimum, all around. Figures, schematics, drawings, diagrams and tables may be in a smaller type size, but shall be no smaller than 8-point. All narrative text must be single-spaced. Figures, schematics, drawings, diagrams, schedule charts, and tables may also be single-spaced. 3.2. White Paper Responses containing data or information not to be disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the Government except for market research shall include statements to that effect on the first/title page and on each page that contains such data or information. Respondents bear sole responsibility for clearly marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. To aid the Government, sources are requested to segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. 3.3. White Paper Responses should be prepared IAW format specified in 3.1 and should simply and economically provide a straightforward, concise delineation of respondent's capabilities and an approach needed to replace  the ECU as described in this RFI. White Paper Responses should address the following:  3.3.1. A company description and discussion of company capabilities with respect to fulfilling the objectives outlined in this RFI.  Please include your business type/size for NAICS 333415. 3.3.2. A description of previous experience in this field with either commercial or government customers. 3.3.3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for cost and schedule to deliver one ECU. The ROM should, to the extent practicable, delineate non-recurring engineering (NRE). 3.3.4. Any additional information that will assist in understanding your responses to the RFI. 3.3.5. Respondents are encouraged to provide comment with respect to the following:  3.3.5.1. Technical aspects described herein that are either too vague or overly-burdensome and the reason(s) for commenting on those aspects; 3.3.5.2.

At the end of this cycle phase, debris entrapped by the self-flushing strainer shall be sent to drain with the used treatment water. <br />Wash- Fresh hot water from the customer's supply shall be used to fill the sump, with detergent being introduced by dispenser or manually during filling. When the sump is full, heating shall begin in order to bring the wash solution up to the desired temperature. The wash treatment shall be under pressure from the main treatment pump at 230 GPM @ 80 feet of head. At the end of the wash cycle, detergent solution shall be flushed to drain.

At-the election of the operator, this treatment cycle phase shall utilize the temperature guarantee circuitry. In this case, timing of the cycle phase shall not begin until the rinse water is recirculating at the set point temperature, <br />thus guaranteeing appropriate sanitation. At completion, this rinse water shall be retained in the sump for use as pre-wash water for the next load.</p>

<p>VI.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, past performance and price.<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are slightly more important when combined when compared to price. However, the strength of the Government's preference for such non-price factors depends on the marginal cost of obtaining higher technical merit. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offer.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. Also, 52.212-2(b) above does not apply to this requirement since there are no options.</p>

<p>Background Statement</p>
<p>Scientists at the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Facility for Biotechnology Resources (FBR), are engaging in many aspects of biomedical research and conducting product reviews relevant to food and drug efficacy and safety. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) manipulations including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of gene fragments, vector construction for gene expression, and mutagenesis of gene sequences are some of the routine tasks undertaken at CBER on a daily basis. These activities provide critical information for the identification of viral strains involved in seasonal flu, viruses or microorganisms causing diseases, or mutations that are responsible for certain phenotypes threatening the health and well being of humans. Most of these DNA manipulations require sequence confirmation via DNA sequencing. Staff at FBR assists scientists in DNA sequencing endeavors using two Applied Biosystem's (AB) genetic analyzers, models 3130 and 3500. These two instruments are used almost every day to serve the needs of CBER scientists' research projects. Both instruments produce valuable sequence information that allows scientists to bring their project to the next level or to modify experimental strategies for improvement. To ensure this high-volume work, annual preventive maintenance (PM) and timely repairs of these analyzers are required. The establishment of a PM agreement with a vendor that has knowledge of hardware and software and spare parts for these instruments, as well as technical expertise in problem diagnosis and instrument repair, is therefore required.</p>
<p>PM Requirements</p>
<p>The FDA is soliciting quotes for a PM Agreement in support of the following two AB Genetic Analyzers:</p>

The FFTB makes frequent use of Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation signal simulators to generate the Radio Frequency (RF) environment required to test spacecraft subsystems.  The Government requires highly specialized and complicated GPS constellation signal simulators that generate the appropriate signals over the highly dynamic conditions.  The GPS Simulator Statement of Work, which details the requirements, may be accessed at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=	    . This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NNG13450485Q.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.  The solicitation has been prepared with the intent to award on a sole source basis to Spirent Federal Systems located at 22345 La Palma Ave., Suite 105, Yorba Linda, California, 92887.  All other offerors may submit a written quote via e-mail that will be reviewed by the Government.  However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334220; Small Business Size: 750 Employees.  Items to be acquired are the following: (1) a 4- RF output GPS constellation signal simulator system, (2) a 2-RF output GPS constellation signal simulator subsystem, (3) additional hardware to expand the capability of a previously acquired 2-RF output GPS signal simulator subsystem from 12 simulation channels to 16 simulation channels in L1, L2 and L5, requiring eight channel cards in total, (4) a distribution unit for connecting the previously acquired 2-RF output GPS constellation signal simulator subsystem with the 2-RF output GPS constellation signal simulator subsystem acquired by this procurement, and (5) integration and initial calibration of the 4-RF output GPS constellation signal simulator system which will be created by combining the previously acquired 2-RF output GPS constellation signal simulator subsystem with the 2-RF output GPS constellation signal simulator subsystem acquired by this procurement. The delivery of the items to be acquired shall be no later than 18 weeks after the contract award date. The place of delivery is included in the GPS Simulators Statement of Work.

The provision at 52.209-7, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters, applies to this acquisition.	 The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to OfferorsCommercial, applies to this acquisition.	 The provision at 52.212-2, EvaluationCommercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Descending Order of importance: 1) Technical Capability of the items offered to meet the Government requirement, 2) Price, and 3) Past Performance.  Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.   The offeror shall submit, as part of its quote, existing product literature in addition to information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.  Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone and fax) of a contact for each contract listed. The offeror should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contract listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quotes. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items, Alternate I with its offer.

<a href="mailto:jmdavis@usgs.gov">jmdavis@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Telonics, Inc. under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)), Simplified Acquisition Procedures for nine (9) TGW-4689H-3 with salt water switch & CR-2A for polar bear, one (1) Upgrade uGPSI20 to TGW-4689H-3 with salt water switch & CR-2A, and one (1) refurbish TGW-4689-2 with salt water switch & CR-2A and shipping services to Anchorage, AK 99508. Telonics transmitters have been deployed on polar bears in Alaska since the early 1980's.  The units are hermetically sealed to eliminate moisture problems. The transmitters are cold tested and built to operate at -40F.  Telonics satellite transmitters have a full warranty and can be refurbished repeatedly, thus decreasing overall costs. The polar bear project has used this equipment for over 20 years. Data integrity, consistency and efficiency are all served by continuing to work with the same products. Project personnel have invested considerable time designing collar programming, data downloading and processing methods that are compatible with the format of Telonics products. The agencies that work on the populations of polar bears adjacent to our study area also use Telonics collars. This uniformity allows for seamless monitoring of collar equipped polar bears across the region when needed.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USGS'S requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement on or be before the closing date, which shall be considered by the Agency (FAR 5.207(c) (16) (ii)). All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Mrs. Davis, jmdavis@usgs.gov. This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-62, Effective 20 Dec 2012. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (14) (i), one or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334220 (Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing). SBA Size Standard in employees: 750

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p>Jan 1, 2013</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>1. Would you be willing to clarify whether this is a breakout of services described via T1-T6-Sources-Sought-Engineering-Services?<br />a. If this is the case, do you anticipate issuing another SSN for the T6?<br />b. Have you determined whether to keep the sustainment for both aircrafts separate or combined?</p>
<p>2. If the two sources sought notices are unrelated, would you be willing to share the incumbent name and contract number to T1A Aircraft Sustainment?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>This is in no way related to the T1-T6 Sources Sought you referenced.<br />This is for T1 only. There is no incumbent for this because a contract does<br />not exist for what the government is asking for in the notice.</p>

It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive. Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firms listed. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer Patrick Campbell, 405-734-8119, patrick.campbell2@tinker.af.mil.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Wisconsin Physicians Services (WPS) under the current contract number HHSM-500-2011-M0006Z in the amount of $25,135 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for Painting the Gate Chamber Equipment, Colebrook Lake Dam, Colebrook, Connecticut.  This announcement is to determine the interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business and Small Business concerns as described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 238320.  The project is planned to be issued on or about February 2013 and is expected to take about six months.  The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00.  <br>    <br>  This project consists of painting the equipment contained within the gate chamber at the Colebrook River Dam to include six gate stems, three air exchange tubes, one spiral staircase and two sump pumps.  The existing paint coatings on these items have partially failed.  There are areas where the paint is peeling, blistering and rusted.  The Contractor shall remove the failed paint areas by abrasive blasting but leave the intact paint areas in place.  Existing paint is lead-based, the Contractor shall employ worker safety precautions.  The gate chamber is considered a permit-required confined space due to one exit/egress point.  The gate chamber is accessible only through by taking an elevator down into the tower, and then descending through the chamber using a spiral staircase.  The gate chamber is at the base of the service tower of the dam and is subject to high humidity levels and no air flow.  This will necessitate the Contractor installing an air exchange system in addition to the supplied air systems utilized by the workers.  The only source of outside air is the doorway at the top of the service tower, approximately 200' feet above the chamber.  The chamber is approximately 30' x 24' x 33' high, and does contain a roof hatch and Gantry crane that the Contractor may use.  <br>    <br>  Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work components stated above.  Firms must submit past demonstrated experience with abrasive blasting of lead-containing paints, applying paints in confined spaces and experience with designing and installing air exchange systems.  Subcontractors may be used to demonstrate this past experience.  This experience must have been performed within the last five years.  Responses are due by December 19, 2012.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Kimberly B. Pumyea.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.

<p>This effort was awarded as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Level of Effort (LOE) contract. The exact nature and extent of the work covered by this contract, as well as the precise methodology of performing the work, cannot be reasonably established far enough in advance. In addition, the cost of performing the work under this type of contract cannot be established in advance or accurately forecast with the adequacy or accuracy to permit award of a fixed price contract. Therefore, a contract type that is flexible in nature and can change as the work progresses is considered appropriate for this procurement.</p>

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(5), "Authorized or Required by Statute", as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or a Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB).

Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.  All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis to determine any future acquisition strategy.

8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on November 2, 2012 to determine if CC&C Management Services, LLC is a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that CC&C Management Services, LLC is registered and certified and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with the federal small business size standard for the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code 541410, Interior Design Services.

The technical experts from OA SRS have determined that CC&C Management Services, LLC is technically capable of meeting the Government's requirements for this effort. 

9.  Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 8127(c).  This acquisition is below the $5,000,000.00 threshold, CC&C Management Services, LLC is a responsible SDVOSB for performance of the services herein, and the proposed contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.

Procuring Contracting Officer	Signature: _____________________

12.  Procuring Contracting Officer Certification: For a proposed contract exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $650,000, the contracting officer's certification required by FAR 6.303-2(b)(12) will serve as approval.  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  As this contract action does not exceed $650,000, the certification below required by FAR 6.303-2(b)(12) serves as approval.
