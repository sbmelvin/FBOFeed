<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative research and development projects to streamline and automate DNA analysis.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-0034202.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set-aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102 (d) (2) (i).

(b) The Contractor shall provide and host all IT infrastructure requirements for the conduct of the survey, including software, hardware (including web-based servers), connectivity, security and backups. TASK 2:  PILOT SURVEY:  (a) The Contractor shall provide the to USGS a fully-functioning, pilot-tested version of the survey for acceptance at least two weeks prior to survey administration.  Pilot testing will be scheduled, communicated and overseen by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the USGS Employee Survey Program Manager, and will include 30-40 USGS employees who will be identified by the COTR.  (b) Conduct the pilot test one to two weeks prior to the actual survey administration to allow for any changes that need to be made.  The Contractor will test the entire web-based administration of the survey to ensure that it meets pre-established USGS criteria, and to provide sample reports for headquarters, regions and selected cost centers to ensure that the format and information are clear and useful.  (c) Provide pilot test results and reports within five days of test completion.  (d) Make any changes to process, format or content that the COTR deems necessary based on the pilot test results.  TASK 3:  SURVEY ADMINISTRATION  (a) The Contractor shall ensure that employee anonymity will be preserved through the inability of the system to link responses to any identifying employee information, including the distribution of passcodes or setting up secure reporting sites.  (b) Web-hosting shall be the Contractor's responsibility, including: any technical issues such as connectivity, access or performance of the system; system security; distribution of email invitations; data collection and backup; maintaining response rate database for 24 x 7 access; and loading of data into reporting system.  (c) The Contractor shall provide "real-time" tracking of the survey response rate throughout the entire survey administration period.  (d) The Contractor shall submit one copy of the database of results within one week after the administration of the survey ends to the COTR .  Once all reports have been generated, the Contractor Shall also deliver all html copies of reports generated to the COTR.  At the conclusion of the contract, the Contractor shall destroy all copies of USGS data.  The database remains the property of USGS only.  TASK 4:  REPORTING  (a) Contractor shall work in partnership with the COTR to develop reporting requirements, specifications and timeliness.  (b) Core survey shall be approximately 100 questions over 10 demographics with 6 write-ins.  Each report shall show three comparison lines: bureau, region and cost center.  (c) For a historical perspective and comparison, Contractor shall match current survey with prior 1999 survey response file for the overall bureau-level report.  Approximately one-third of items will match.  COTR will provide historical file.  (d) Contractor shall provide: (i) one bureau report with historical comparisons and demographic breakouts; (ii) three regional and one headquarters report each with bureau comparisons and some demographic breakouts; (iii) 125 cost center reports with bureau/region comparisons with limited demographic breakouts where appropriate.  (e) Contractor shall produce all reports and computer tabulations in .pdf format, ensuring quality and integrity of compilations, computations and translations; post reports on secure web-site; and notify each recipient via email of availability of report along with that person's unique access passcode.  TASK 5:  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:  Contractor shall provide on-going process coordination and facilitation with the USGS in their internal coordination of reporting activities.  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Within two weeks of contract award, the Contractor shall meet with the COTR and others to begin defining specific survey and reporting requirements and timeframes.

Pre-identified reports for the pilot test will be made available to the COTR within 5 working days of the pilot test completion date.  Contractor shall distribute emails to all USGS employees with survey access information on or before the first day of the survey administration.  For the approximately 300 employees without email addresses, passcodes and survey access instructions will be provided to the COTR for distribution 10 days prior to the beginning of the survey administration period.  Contractor shall provide bureau-level overall results report within 1 workday after the survey administration ends.  Comparison and other pre-identified reports must be available as follows: bureau - 1 week after survey administration ends; regional - 2 weeks after survey administration ends; cost centers - 6 weeks after survey administration ends.  Survey administration period is expected to last approximately 3 weeks.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, by Close of Business, AUGUST 30, 2002: (1) a CAPABILITIES STATEMENT detailing: (a) key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the effort) with their qualifications and specific experience; (b) organizational experience and facilities; and (c) past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last two years (References will be checked).  Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on: (a) key personnel skills, abilities and experience; (b) your organization's experience and (c) past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects), adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered products. (2) a TECHNICAL PROPOSAL indicating proposed methods and procedures to be used in administering the survey; actions to be accomplished to ensure that all completeness and confidentiality requirements are satisfied regarding employee responses; a proposed timeline for satisfying the requirements of this RFQ; an outline of proposed process flow for communications, surveys, responses, analyses, storage and reports; and a sample report demonstrating the application of your organizational skills and abilities to the reporting requirements of this RFQ. (3) a COST PROPOSAL as a separate volume from the Capabilities Statement and the Technical Proposal. It shall provide a complete breakdown of labor categories, rates and anticipated hours, along with an estimate of other costs associated with: collection, storing and analyzing responses; creating, producing and distributing reports; materials; travel; file storage, etc.  Submit an original and four (4) copies of each of the three documents. Proposals will be evaluated according to 7 factors, which will be considered roughly equal in importance: (1) demonstrated experience with administering a web-based, large organizational survey with large numbers of reports; (2) technical ability to host a survey with potentially 10,000 respondents; (3) technical ability to generate reports; (4) quality of reports; (5) demonstrated ability to meet timelines as described in statement of work; (6) ability to conduct pilot test and prepare reports within 1 week after test; (7) quality of proposed team. Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFP, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors and cost considered. The Government objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the program objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with The United Way of America. (UWA). This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of  the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Children and Families, Office of Community Services.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Government has a requirement for research and development activities to expand and augment the existing IDA Program by studying and seeking to remedy existing problems with program implementation, and to aid employer involvement in IDAs. The IDA Program was established by the Assets for Independence Act ("AFIA Act"), under Title IV of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, and Training and Educational Services Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-285, 42 U.S.C. 604 Note), as amended. The legislation authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS") -- through its Administration for Children and Families' ("ACF") Office of Community Services ("OCS") -- to conduct a 5-year, $125 million IDA demonstration to establish 40,000 to 50,000 new IDAs across the country. To date, the demonstration project has failed to meet its potential. It is vital for OCS to employ a contractor that will aid OCS in researching and developing ways to overcome obstacles which are currently holding back the growth and development of this important program. Through this contract, it is the goal of the OCS to help facilitate the growth of its IDA program by: (1) creating a cost-effective technology driven universal infrastructure to run an employer-based/work-based IDA program; and (2) studying, researching and creating an employer-based/work-based IDA Demonstration Program.  The importance of enhancing the IDA Program is demonstrated by the strong bi-partisan support it has received by Congress.  There is no doubt that since 1998 support for IDAs has strengthened nationally.  Specifically, the IDA demonstration program received $10 million appropriations in both fiscal years (FY) 1999 and (FY) 2000.  In 1999, $9.4 million was awarded to 40 organizations. In 2000, $4.5 million was awarded to 25 organizations. Congress appropriated $25 million for the IDA demonstration program in its FY 2001 budget resolution.  This was the maximum funding level allowed by law.  The period of performance for this effort is for 24 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by August 23, 2002. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the following: Item 1. Draw tubing supplied by Pratt & Whitney to Lefiel. Draw the tubing from .523" OD X 0.087" wall to 0.375" OD X 0.040 wall. Item 2. From material supplied by NASA GRC, machine and draw GRC0P-84 blank to 0.375" OD X 0.040" wall tubing. When the tubing reaches 0.523 OD X 0.087", remove and send to NASA GRC two of the tubes for evaluation. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Lefiell Mfg. Co., 13750 Firestone Blvd., Santa Fe Springs, GA 90670-0000 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Justification for lack of competition is that the Government is engaged in cooperative research with Pratt & Whitney and LeFiell to produce tubing from GRC0P-84, a new copper alloy developed at NASA GRC. Prior efforts by Pratt & Whitney have identified LeFiell as the sole company capable of producing complex, variable diameter, variable wall thickness tubing in the world.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Aug. 15,2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Jacqueline Duffy, Contract Specialist, 973-724-7660
<DESC>Sole source procurement to Single Chip Systems Corporation, San Diego, California, for the purchase of objective Radio Frequency Identification/Temperature Sensing Transponders and compatible Reader/Writers to support Government Qualification Testing.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price type contract.  The period of performance for this effort will be not later than 30 June 2003.  The contractor shall supply man-hours, materials, and facilities to: modify, redesign, develop and produce a transponder operating at the specified frequency, a Reader/Writer (Reader) capable of verification of transponder function and writing data to the transponder memory during Qualification testing.  Deliverables shall include 1800 transponders; three prototype readers to support testing, software for test Readers, software development kit, objective script or source code for control software.  The effort is the fabrication of the objective transponder and compatible Reader/Writer to be used during the Qualification Test.  The 155MM M231/M232 propelling charges known as MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System) are two different propelling charges, each to contain a radio frequency identification/temperature measuring transponder, designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal which provide a complete zoning solution for 155MM artillery applications by using multiples of a basic increment. The transponder electronically provides the Reader, when queried, the increment type, lot number, temperature and other data stored in its memory.  The Reader consists of an antenna, electronics modules (transmitter, receiver, encoder, decoder, data converter, computer interface) a power supply, cabling and computer.  The M231 increment(s) is (are) used at lower zones (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 increments are used at higher zones (Zones 3 thru 6).  Both the M231 and M232 increments are based on the classical XM230 Unicharge design; i.e., bi-directional center core ignition, granular propellant contained in a rigid combustible cartridge case, etc., however, the M231 and M232 have design differences. All M231 increments are identical allowing them to be interchangeable (likewise with the M232). The 155MM MACS propelling charge increments will be capable of being handled by automatic loading/resupply equipment and also manually, which allows MACS to be used with currently fielded howitzers and future planned artillery systems.  Point of contact for this action is Jacqueline Duffy, Contract Specialist, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, AMSTA-AQ-APE, Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000.  email, jduffy@pica.army.mil; phone, 973-724-7660.

<ARCHDATE>09282002
<CONTACT>Kathy Hansen, Contract Specialist, 973-724-6093
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This  announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested  and a written solicitation will not be issued.  RFP #DAAE30-02-R-0831. The US  Army TACOM ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal has the following requirement The  Pyrotechnic Systems Team at Picatinny Arsenal requires two batch mixers to  replace old mixer-mullers in their Pyrotechnic Pilot Plant.  Specifically the  mixers must be of the muller type that will circulate slurries of powdered  pyrotechnic composition and solvent to achieve a high degree of homogeneity.    Two mixers are required  one for small amounts of mix (1 lb minimum) and  the other for larger amounts (maximum 30 lbs.)   Mixes to be made are typical  pyrotechnic formulations that contain powdered metals and oxidizers.  The  mixes will be wetted with solvent or epoxy.  The solvent usually contains a  dissolved binder that coats the particles as the solvent flashes off.  The  mixers will be operated remotely.  The mixers must blend the pyrotechnic  mixes safely with regard to their sensitivity to stimuli such as friction,  electrostatic discharge etc.  EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS: (1) Can safely mix bulk pyrotechnic composition and flammable liquids without causing ignition of  composition or solvent.  (2) Mixer type shall be that commonly known as a  muller.  Contains blades, wheels or other components that move the  composition/solvent slurry in a relatively shallow mixing bowl and also induce  vertical circulation of the slurry.  MATERIAL PROPERTIES ARE: (1) Formulation  of pyrotechnic compositions is 10-90 weight % of powdered metals, 10-90 weight  % of powdered oxidizers, - 15 weight % of thermoplastic or thermoset binders,  1-25 weight % of other powdered chemicals,  (2) Metals include magnesium,  aluminum, boron, titanium, silicon, zirconium, tungsten. (3) Most common  oxidizers include sodium nitrate, Teflon, potassium nitrate, barium chromate,  potassium per chlorate, barium nitrate, strontium nitrate. (4) Other chemicals  can include polyvinyl chloride, silicon dioxide, and graphite among others.  (5) Typical binders are Viton, HyTemp,  Elvax, Polyvinyl Acetate, Vinyl  Alcohol Acetate Resin,  Polyester Resins, Epoxies. (6) Most binders are  contained in a solvent that flashes off during the mixing cycle.  Typical  solvents are acetone, ethanol, cyclohexane, butyl acetate. (7) In some cases  mixes are blended with a liquid that does not contain any dissolved binder.   (8) Density range of composition/solvent slurry before any flashing of  solvent is 0.75  1.50 gm/cc. (9) Range of solids/liquid ratio is 1.0  1.2 gm (solid)/cc(liquid). (10) Safety requirements mandate introduction of oxidizer  followed by liquid or solvent and then fuel. (11) Mix cycle is run until no  solvent is visible but composition is still wetted. (12) Density range of  wetted bulk composition is 0.4  2.0 gm/cc. (13) Contains remotely operated  powder discharge, such as porthole in bottom, that can be opened and allow  powder to be dumped into container underneath. (14) Designed to minimize  collection of slurry on parts outside mixer bowl during mixing.  This will  reduce the need for wipe down of these parts. (15) Mullers, wheels, plows  and other similar parts are adjustable for height and pitch to allow for  differences in batch size and slurry density. ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE:  (1) 230V, 1 or 3 phase. (2) Explosion proof motor for Class I, Group D and  Class II, Group E. (3) Motor must be capable of being located outside mixing  bay.  MAXIMUM DIMENSIONS:  including stands and support structures, not to  exceed: (1) SMALL MIXER -  Width = 24 inches, Depth = 40 inches, Height = 66  inches (2) LARGE MIXER  Width = 48 inches, Depth = 48 inches, Height = 78  inches. OTHER REQUIREMENTS: (1) Capable of being strongly affixed (e.g.,  bolted) to floor.  (2) Provides open space of approximately Width = 24 inches,  Depth = 24 inches, Height = 18 inches under mixer to allow container to be  placed under discharge port.  (3) Contact surfaces constructed from 304 or 316  stainless steel.  Other components constructed from corrosion resistant  materials or surface treated to prevent corrosion.  (4) Operated remotely.(5)  VENDOR WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT VERIFIES THAT EQUIPMENT MEETS ABOVE  REQUIREMENTS.

<DESC>NA The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Research Analysis and Maintenance, Inc, a small, women-owned business located in El Paso, TX, as a bridge contract for non-personal support services to the ATEC Threat Support Activity (ATSA) locate d in Fort Bliss, Texas. Current contract expires 30 September 2002.  The bridge contract will be for a base period of 15 months with a six-month option and inclusion of continuity of services clause to accommodate transition of ATSA from ATEC to Threat Sys tems Management Office (TSMO).  The sole source award ensures critical support missions are met while providing TSMO adequate time to integrate ATSA into its organization, evaluate current/future mission direction and scope, review and redefine support req uirements, and identify support service requirements sufficiently to support a fair, competition solicitation. A resolicitation would not be prudent at this time  as it would waste both Government and industry time and dollars against a solicitation that w ould be ill defined, subject to radical changes both during and after the solicitation process, and lacking the time for adequate proposal development and evaluation.   See Note 22.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). This BAA is also listed at http://www.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations). I. INTRODUCTION.  PMA 231 E-2/C-2 within the Naval Air Systems Command seeks proposals describing innovative and practical reasoning algorithm technology that supports multi-source integration and data fusion with the E-2C's various weapon system sensor tracks to produce a single track with source attributes.  The objectives of the data integration include the following:  (1) "One track for One Piece of Metal" with correlated/associated attributes, leading to decreased operator workload and enhanced situational awareness. (2)Fuse all sources of data/information in a probabilistic manner that supports Combat Identification Technologies.  II. BACKGROUND. The MSI project supports both the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 and the E-2C Radar Modernization Program.  The objective is to create and develop product that enhances operator situational awareness, while supporting Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) requirements and transition to a Network Centric Warfare architecture.  Data fusion is a requirement discussed in the Joint Theater Air Missile Defense Capstone Requirements Document (CRD). BAA respondent's will focus their effort within PMA 231's Advanced Development MSI technical boundary explained in the MSI Proposal Information Package (PIP) and will be expected to develop, demonstrate, and provide software-based computational, multi-source algorithms to improve MSI through data fusion of existing sensors and sources of data within the aircraft's weapon system. This product will additionally serve as a foundation for future Combat Identification technologies. MSI goals of providing automated track association and correlation from various sensors utilizing common algorithms is challenging but necessary to meet emerging requirements and improve overall operator situational awareness.  PMA 231 Advanced Development is leading the development of MSI fusion techniques as key building blocks for the development of a MSI fusion system with potential for demonstration on several future US Naval Weapon Systems. PMA 231 Advanced Development's MSI efforts are focused on employing automated data fusion of existing track data from various on and off-board sensors and sources. These weapon system sensors and sources include the Radar, IFF, CEC, ESM, Link 4/11/16 and SATCOM data feeds. In addition, the broader MSI project objectives beyond those of this BAA may include: 1.Applications of MSI products to supporting a Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) 2. Applications of MSI products to Combat Identification 3.  Utilization of all database/all source information to formulate a composite tactical picture for the purposes of maximizing crew situational awareness and minimizing crew workload. Offerors must review the detailed information on the E-2C Hawkeye MSI Program that can be found in the PIP, which will be available on the NAVAIR AIR 2.0 website on or before 4 September 2002.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manger, Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, E-mail:  ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Ing. Rene Lerch Lara, Director Commercial, Intermodal M?xico, S.A. de C.V., Av. Insurgentes Sur, No. 432 6  Piso, Col. Roma Sur, 06760 M?xico, D.F., Tel: 52-55-5564-7066, ext. 7778, Fax: (52 55) 5584-4054, E-mail: rlerch@gmexico.com.mx  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for Intermodal Mexico S.A. de C.V.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) has approved a grant to Intermodal Mexico, which is wholly owned by the Mexican mining and transportation company Grupo Mexico.  Intermodal M?xico was established in July 2001 with the objective of building and operating a network of intermodal terminals, primarily to meet the demand for intermodal service from its sister company, Ferrocarril Mexicano (Ferromex), the concessionaire of the Pacific rail line.  Ferromex is also owned by Grupo Mexico (74%), along with its minority partner Union Pacific (26%) of the United States.  Intermodal M?xico?s business strategy is to capitalize on the growing demand for intermodal services generated by increased trade resulting from NAFTA, the growth of container traffic and the increased efficiency of rail transport in Mexico.  It offers integrated intermodal services including terminal operations, secondary operations, integration with rail service, fiscal inspection, maintenance and storage of containers and piggy backs, refrigerated storage services, and ?door-to-door? delivery.

The feasibility study will assess the potential for intermodal terminals at a number of locations in Mexico. Intermodal M?xico has already undertaken initial assessments of market size, site location, and terminal design for a number of locations and the study team will base its work on this material. The feasibility study will critique and verify market assumptions and recommend adjustments to terminal site locations and the phases of terminal development.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a U.S. $200,000 grant to the Grantee from TDA.  Intermodal Mexico will contribute a cost-share of U.S. $40,000.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 5:00p.m., Mexico City local time, September 9, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

To be considered qualified to perform this project, a firm must possess all of the following minimum capabilities: 1) Scientific and engineering knowledge and capabilities in plant and animal invasion of dams; 2) information technology experience to prepare the dam owner education materials and expert-level guidebook; and 3) demonstrated knowledge and experience through the completion of previous projects in this area of the state-of-practice of dam penetrations of embankment dams by plants and animals, probable impacts of dam penetrations, plant and animal eradication measures, and remedial measures to reduce penetration impacts.  Firms with these capabilities are invited to submit complete information to the procuring office identified in this notice in three (3) copies by August 16, 2002.  Information furnished should include: (1) the number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical and other appropriate personnel; (2) company experiences and past work related to the proposed project; (3) a description of general and special facilities; (4) a current financial statement; and (5) other literature which demonstrates minimum capabilities listed above.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR A WALK-IN FREEZER.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions submitted by potential offerors.  Questions 1-22 were answered in amendment 2. Q23. Can the freezer Alarm System be equipped with Remote Notification outputs (Automatic Digital Dialer, Central Station Monitoring, etc.) in place of the primary recorder? ANSWER 23. The purpose of this requirement is to have the capability of recording the freezers air temperature to ensure safe handling of our batteries (the product).  We want to know how long the product was out of specification.  If the remote notification outputs you are referring to (automatic digital dialer, central station monitoring, etc.) do the same thing as a primary recorder, then they will be sufficient.  Recording is needed at least every 30 minutes, with the option to take other data intervals.  It is acceptable to propose the baseline requirement and an alternate proposal for any deviations.    Q24. Because the portable platform trucks used to carry the batteries are 30" wide. Would NASA accept a standard walk-in freezer door in place of the double swing doors? The standard door would be 60" (5 feet) wide and 96" (8 feet) tall. This door opening would also allow easy access for forklift trucks. ANSWER 24. Yes Q25. Would a Plastic Strip Door Curtain be required? ANSWER 25. No, but it would be acceptable to list this as a separately priced item in the quote, keeping in mind overall cost to the government will be taken into consideration during evaluation.  Q26. Should the refrigeration system be sized for normal operation at 14 deg. F (-10 deg.C) in 110 deg. F Ambient weather conditions or -4 deg F (-20 deg. C) in 110 deg. F Ambient weather conditions.  ANSWER 26. 14 deg. F (-10 deg. C) in 110 deg. F ambient weather conditions is our set point we need to achieve under any ambient temperature conditions.      Q27. Can the existing concrete pad be re-used for the new freezer?  ANSWER 27. Yes, assuming your freezer can be placed on an ordinary driveway (the existing concrete pad is the pavement).   The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 7/23/2002. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>s).   The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).   BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA Holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of  (a) a usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual document, i.e. task order, will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted in this synopsis.  However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000.  A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00, if all parties are in agreement.   The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.   There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the BOA Holders only.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks.  Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types.  EMERGENCY REPAIRS:  Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others.

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE:  The BOA covers military installations within the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC) Pensacola area of responsibility, including NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, Outlying Landing Fields (OLF), and NAVRESCRUITSTA and NAVMARCORESCEN, Mobile, AL.  The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years.  The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued thereunder.  If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the agreement holder and the agreement will terminate.  Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.   Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation.  The agreement holders maybe required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal.  SOLICITATIONS:  Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.   The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.  ORDERS:  Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time.  Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.  LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The average range will be from $100,000.00 to a maximum of $3,000,000.

<SUBJECT>A -- Biologically Inspired Multifinctional Dynamic Robotics (BIODYNOTICS) Workshop
<DESC>Biologically Inspired Multifunctional Dynamic Robotics (BIODYNOTICS) Workshop, SN02-25.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring an informational and team-forming workshop on biorobotics in preparation for a new program in this area. This workshop will take place October 7, 2002, at the Executive Conference Center in Arlington, Virginia.  Attendance at the Workshop is OPTIONAL, BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all potential bidders.  The goals of this program are to explore the use of biologically inspired practices, principles, multifunctional materials, sensors, and signal processing to demonstrate energy efficient and autonomous locomotion and behavior in challenging unplanned environments (e.g., rubble of different sizes, flight in wind, turbulent water).  We are interested in exploring new modalities of locomotion such as climbing (trees, cliffs, cave walls), jumping, and leaping and the ability to manipulate the world with an appendage that allows grasping and digging.  The ability to exploit biological inspirations enabling autonomous recognition and navigation to targets of interest in cluttered backgrounds is also of interest.  The one-day workshop is intended to explore components of a new program and to nurture discussion and ideas from the community in preparation for proposal submission.  The workshop will bring together experts in biology, engineering, computational science, material science, robotics, neuroscience, and biomechanics to discuss research challenges, approaches, and potential anticipated solutions The agenda for the meeting will consist of presentations from DARPA and other Defense organizations that have interest in this area as well as brief presentations from the community on specific areas relevant to possible program goals.  Details of the Workshop, including information regarding registration may be found at the BIODYNOTICS registration website, 
http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=130.  The workshop registration fee is $65.00 and includes all workshop activities in addition to a continental breakfast and working lunch.  Registration cut-off is September 30, 2002, or at attendance capacity, which ever comes first.  Space is limited to 70 attendees, therefore, early registration is recommended.  For further information, send electronic mail to BIODYNOTICS_workshop@darpa.mil.  This announcement is NOT a request for proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time. DARPA anticipates, but cannot guarantee, that a solicitation will be released prior to the workshop.
