<a href="mailto:allison.ross@faa.gov">allison.ross@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current Information Technology (IT) asset management marketplace.   The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.
The FAA is seeking information related to commercially available technology, services, as well as recommended processes and experience needed to gather/process details on physical and virtual IT assets, manage those assets, and to refresh and maintain an enterprise IT Asset Inventory, in the context of a federated environment that is dynamic, heterogeneous and geographically dispersed.  
This market survey is being conducted in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) policy section 3.2.1.2.1. The survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for informational and planning purposes.  The responses to this market survey will not be released. Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked.  This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this market survey is to seek industry input in the areas of IT asset inventory and management and to allow an opportunity for industry suggestions and recommendations for tools, services, processes and alternate strategies.  We are seeking interested sources that are capable of assisting the FAA refresh the latest IT asset inventory and improve the agency's IT asset management processes.  
This is not a request for proposal.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this announcement.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation. 

BACKGROUND & SCOPE OF WORK
The FAA maintains an IT asset repository that it periodically refreshes.  This inventory is used to help identify IT cost savings through consolidation of service support and infrastructure, enterprise licensing agreements (ELAs), bulk purchase agreements (BPAs), infrastructure service level management, and helps the agency respond to internal/external data calls related to IT.
The FAA is looking for a tool,  service or both  to scan and build an IT asset repository which will integrate data from both automated systems (such as Remedy, Systems Management Server, ActiveDirectory, VMWare, etc.) as well as more primitive, manual sources (such as spreadsheets/databases).  A non-intrusive network scan, which considers the dynamic, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed environment, is also needed to validate at least some of the data provided.    Details from both a registry scan and file scan are expected. The data must be combined and normalized.   Asset categories and subcategories must be assigned.  Virtual systems must be distinguished from physical systems.   The assets must be allocated to their owning business unit and a geographical location using multiple sources and methods.
Initially, a snapshot of the environment is needed.  However, as process improvements are recommended and implemented, the goal is to move toward a current and accurate inventory.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS
In five (5) pages or less, present a solution using specific tools and/or services that can help the FAA refresh their Information Technology asset inventory.  (This inventory must contain detailed information about installed hardware and software on servers, workstations, printers, and network devices.  Inventory reports are also required that highlight observations, recommendations, and trend analysis against commercial products found in the inventory, compliance to published standards, and lessons learned.)
All responses must include a company POC with telephone number, address and email address.  Submissions are due by 2:00PM local time on February 18, 2009.  Two (2) copies of the response shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Alli Ross, at the following address: 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)William J. Hughes Technical CenterATTN:  AJA-4730 (Alli Ross)Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405
Questions must be sent via E-Mail to allison.ross@faa.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 6, Lakewood, Colorado intends to award a non-competitive, sole source IDIQ Contract to Milliken Meats, Ltd for Toronto Carivore Diet for endangered black footed ferrets at the Black Footed  Ferret Facility, Carr, Colorado.  The requirement will be awarded as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Early diets were patterned after mink farm programs and were problematic in availability of diet element components, preparation, labor, storage, and overall animal benefits (e.g. rabbit bone parts periodically caused clinical complications and death).  The American Zoo and Aquarium Association's, Black-footed Ferret Species Survival Plan (SSP) worked through several zoo nutritional specialists to examine possible diet alternatives; and with development of the Toronto Carnivore Diet undertook, both nutritional analyses specifically for ferrets and clinical comparisons of animal condition following feeding trials of multiple diets.  The Toronto Carnivore Diet was found to be superior for black-footed ferrets and is the recommended principal artificial diet for the species.  The Service concurs with the position of the SSP advisory group and has found that this diet results in better overall animal health, is easy to secure and store, and reduces labor and overall staff costs.  Contracting Officer:  Cathleen DeBerry, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 6, Denver, CO 303-236-4324.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with LTF SPA; Metrology Division, of Antegnate, Italy, for the acquisition of a Retrofit of a NIST owned Rockwell Hardness Standardizing Machine direct replacement air cooled magnet power supply for a Model 10 VSM to be used in the Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Background: 
The NIST Rockwell Hardness Standardizing Machine (HSM) is a key component for maintaining the U.S. primary Rockwell hardness scales. The NIST HSM is a specially designed machine, manufactured by LTF. The LTF HSMs are used primarily by National Metrology Institutes to conduct primary hardness calibrations for industry. The LTF HSM is designed to apply forces during a test by transferring calibrated weights onto a load frame. When making measurements on the Rockwell superficial hardness scales, rotary air-bearings are used to offset the preliminary force weight-frame. It has been determined that the rotary air-bearings may cause an error to the force application, which may not be apparent during a test.  LTF has redesigned the machine to eliminate the need for the rotary air-bearings.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need to have the original equipment manufacturer make the required modifications to maintain the measurement accuracy of the machine and the integrity of the NIST Rockwell hardness standardization program.  The new design for the LTF HSM is a proprietary design and is not licensed to other manufacturers.  LTF SPA is the only known vendor capable of providing the required retrofit for the NIST owned Rockwell Hardness Standardizing Machine.

The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334519, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541430 with size standard of $7.0M.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, has determined that the sole /single source reference is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein.

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Watermark Design Office, 621 Wythe Street, Alexandria, VA 22314 for the final phase, Phase 4,  of development of a training CD entitled Training in Basic Biomethodology for Laboratory Rats as outlined in the statement of work.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals to develop a valid and reliable, standardized instrument that measures the propensity to and severity of drug addiction. The instrument is expected to provide transformational, scientific, technical, and practical utility for addiction research through its capacity to quantify the likelihood of becoming addicted (propensity) and an objective measure of the extent to which addiction manifests once developed (severity).  The work requires the successful contractor to maintain a Federal-Wide Assurance for working with human subjects approved through the Office for Human Research Protections, NIH.

NIDA anticipates the award of one cost reimbursement contract for a period of 2-years with 2 twelve-month option periods.  
 
RFP No. N01DA-9-5547 will be available electronically on or about March 9, 2009.

<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire teleradiology reading services in support of Naval Hospital Jacksonville Florida. The scope of duties includes interpretation, dictation, and transcription for each received study. The contractor provides preliminary and final readings within 24 hours of request for services. The workload includes interpretation, dictation, and transcription of approximately 48 computed tomography (CT), and 23 Ultrasound (US) readings per week.
FISC intends to award a purchase order to satisfy the proposed acquisition as a sole source action under authority of FAR 6.302 to Templeton Readings LLC, of Sparks, MD 21152. The placement of a firm fixed price purchase order for six months, to begin 1 March 2009, is anticipated. The six month purchase order will be issued as an interim order in anticipation of the award of a long-term contract to begin 1 September 2009 for a possible 1 year base period of performance plus for option years under a full and open competition that will be announced separately. Considering the urgent requirement for continued teleradiology services at NH Jacksonville a sole source action to Templeton Readings LLC is necessary. Templeton is the incumbent contractor and is considered to be the only known contractor that can provide the required services for this short term period without degradation or break in those services. If a break in services occurs it will have a great negative impact on ! the health and wellbeing of warfighters and those receiving medical care at NH Jacksonville. The solicitation number is N00189-09-Q-Z033 and the applicable NAICS code is 621399. Please direct any questions concerning this purchase order to Lauren Lauver via email at Lauren.lauver@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using simplified acquisition procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. This combined synopsis/solicitation shall be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil/). The RFP number is N00244-09-R-0024. This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-27 and DFARS Change Notice 20081112. It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: http://www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.  The NAICS code i! s 334516 and the Small Business Standard is 500 employees. 
The Government has a requirement for the HR Interferometer Laser system to be used to calibrate the Electro-Optic Variant of the Virtual Instrument Portable Electronic Repair/Test System (VIPER/T), AN/USM-717 .  
All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item
CLIN 0001-  HR Interferometer system  - (Quantity of 3 each) meeting all of the  following required specification:
System:				A phase shifting interferometer of the						Twyman-Green type 0.02 wavelength or						better phase sensitivity Measuring wavelength:		632.8 nmBeam Shaping Optics:			F/3 Calibration Artifact:			1/20 wave PV (0.03 micron) accuracy Resolution:		 		1000 x 1000 pixel detector/cameraReflectivity:				4% and 80% reflector,Laser Source:	Single frequencyStabilized HeNe Fiber and fiber coupling 8-hour laser frequency stability of <12 x 10-9 3-nanometer displacement repeatabilityReturn Flat Assembly:		Precision 10" fused quartz 					1/20 wave PV (0.03 micron) accuracy							Front mounted in Tip/Tilt StageInterferometer Mount:			X, Y, and Z and rotation adjustable mountDedicated computer system including measurement and analysis softwareOnsite installation and training
TETS System Wavefront Performance establishes the requirements for the above mentioned specifications:
The accuracy of the Interferometer Calibration artifact is 0.05 waves. The tolerance is doubled as a transfer standard. Repeatability of PV measurements is specified as 0.005 waves.
The single pass requirement for the collimator mirror cell is1/6 wave/fringe. The fold mirror tolerance is 1/10 before bonding. These surface area tolerances are  the equivalent wavefront tolerances. The peak-valley single pass wavefront tolerance for the assembled and aligned collimator module is 0.59 waves at a wavelength of 632.8nm. The double pass wavefront error shall be < 1.18 waves. The testing that is being performed basically splits a single incoming beam of light into two identical beams by a grating or a partial mirror. Each of these beams will travel a different route, called a path, before they are recombined at a detector. The path difference, the difference in the distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.Installation/Training/Warranty1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up and provide one (1) training session for NSWC personnel at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, 2300 Fifth Street,  Norco, CA 92860.The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 19.5.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking to acquire medical countermeasures (MCM) that will support an effective public health medical emergency response.  The United States Government (USG) contemplates award of a five year Firm Fixed Price type contract for MCMs that can specifically provide treatment courses for symptomatic individuals exposed to smallpox.  It is the goal of the forthcoming RFP to obtain advanced development products, i.e., at a development level, as classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are in no less than the clinical study phase of the Investigational New Drug (IND) process as well as those products which already have approved therapeutic indications.  Prior to the submission of the proposal, the Offeror must have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in pathologies known to be associated with, or as components of, a Smallpox antiviral drug.  It is the goal of BARDA to place a Smallpox Antiviral drug in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) as a Final Drug Product (FDP) which can be used for the treatment of individuals who are symptomatic. 
 
The desired product that will be acquired with this contract must be able to support a public health medical emergency.  Thus an obligation of this acquisition is to acquire a FDP that can support the potential use of the antiviral drug product during a declared emergency under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).    Other requirements:  (1) for achieving approval, have demonstrated efficacy in a variola challenge in the appropriate animal models (see FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, Smallpox (Variola) Infection: Developing Drugs for Treatment and Prevention); (2) delivery of 1,700,000 treatment courses of FDP of smallpox antiviral drug to the SNS; (3) Be in unit-of-use dosing or other approved packaging that requires no more than three doses per day for up to 21 days; (4) have a minimum expiry period of 36 months of stability and a target of 32 months remaining when delivered to the SNS; (5) have approval for symptomatic adults (18-64 years of age); (6) for achieving additional approved label and extended expiry dating, the USG reserves an option for the following concept plans to (a) support approval of an IV formulation for severely ill in; (b) to support liquid formulation for pediatric and geriatric populations; and (c) to manufacture and control antiviral drug production on a large scale to deliver up to an additional 12 million course.  It is imperative that the Offeror(s) to this RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of their proposals so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices and guidance.

Additional details and requirements will be described in the Smallpox Antiviral solicitation, RFP-BARDA-09-35 which will be made available electronically through FEDBIZOPPS on or about February 24, 2009.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.  This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for this solicitation.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number RFP-BARDA-09-35, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  The contract award resulting from this solicitation will have an estimated award date of September 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.

<DESC>This market survey is in support of a potential Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Case IQ-B-VDC for the Government of Iraq.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Price and Availability (P and A), valid for 12 months, is requested, to included a schedule (timeline) to implement this project.  The P and A will be used to prepare a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to the Government of Iraq.  The signed LOA will be the basis for a future Request for Proposal (RFP).  Any interested sources please send responses, NLT 04 March 2009, to U.S. Army CECOM SAMD, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-SA-COM  Bruce Ballance, Bldg. 1208W, Fort Monmouth NJ 07703-5000. email address: bruce.wayne.ballance@conus.army.mil.  Electronic (email) responses are preferred.<BR><BR>Note that the information below was supplied in a Letter of Request (LOR) from the Iraqi Ministry of Defence (MOD).  CECOM SAMD has asked the MOD questions and received responses to further understand the LOR.  These responses are incorporated in the following requirements.  Additional information is not available.<BR><BR>1.0 Scope<BR><BR>This Requirements Document (RD) describes the necessary requirements to design, manufacture and provide the Iraqi Armed forces (IAF) with Mobile Communications, Command and Control Centers (MC4).  AN MC4 is a system that has been designed to serve as a Command and Control office by armed forces.  The MC4 shall be equipped with Cisco phones, HF radio; VHF-UHF radios, laptops, printers, monitors and other communications equipment.  The main purpose for the MC4 is to use them during the Armed Forces Head Quarter (HQ) movements during military operations.  It will be used as a communication, command and control center for that HQ until it settles in a location and installs the permanent center.<BR><BR>2.0 Background<BR><BR>The Iraq Ministry of Defence (MoD) plans to modernize its communications, command and control systems by acquiring new technologies and extending the communications, command and control systems to their military units in garrison and in the battlefield.  MC4 will be part of this development in order to increase the Army capabilities to communicate and control its units during military operations.  The purpose of this (RD) is to define the specifications required to design the MC4.  The contractor also shall provide technical support and training to MOD personnel.  The MC4 must provide these services:<BR><BR>- Mobility  it must be able to operate in all the geographical locations in Iraq including the mountains and desert roads.<BR>- Robustness  it must be able to operate under severe conditions of the battlefield and have an electronic warfare system providing Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM) to allow all systems including all radios systems, Iraqi Defense Network (IDN), and VSAT to operate in a jamming environment.<BR>- Safety  it must be armored to protect its occupants.<BR>- Secure  it must offer secure communications and data transmission.<BR><BR>3.0 Requirements Specifications<BR><BR>It is paramount that the makes and models specified in this document are used in MC4 to ensure the continuity of operations, maintenance and compatibility across the Iraqi Armed Forces.  Introducing different vendors and radios into the Iraqi C3 network would have a serious and negative operational impact.  It will only complicate our ability to maintain the C3 network, create additional training costs and cause us to needlessly increase the amount of spares in depot and supply stock.  Furthermore, the MC4 consists of many types of hardware including hardware manufactured by Harris, ITT, Cisco, Panasonic, Hewlett Packard &,etc . Sole-source is directed for these specific hardware components in the interest of standardization and interoperability with MOD existing communication infrastructure, and consequent benefits of logistic support.  In the event that any of these specific components are not available, the alternative must be of equal or superior quality and performance, and must be approved by the MoD Program Manager prior to purchase.<BR><BR>The contractor will provide the mobile operations centers with following requirements and specifications:<BR><BR>3.1 Chloride UPS with enough autonomy to run all centers devices except the Air-Conditioning for 30 minutes at minimum.<BR><BR>3.2 Fixed Network Rack for the Iraqi Defense Network (IDN) (at least 14 rack units, and 19 width): that includes the following items:<BR><BR>			Description		         Manufacture	Part Number	Qty<BR>1	Catalyst 2960 24 10-100 plus 2T-SFP LAN Base Image (220v,50Hz)	Cisco	WS-C2960-24TC-L	1<BR>2	APC 8 Port Console Server (220v,50Hz)	APC	AP9301	1<BR>3	Adapter for Console Cables	APC	AP9315	8<BR>4	Cisco 2851 VSEC Bundle with PVDM2-48, FL-SRST-96, Adv IP Serv, 128F-256D (220v,50Hz)	Cisco	Cisco2851-VSECSRST-K9	1<BR>5	Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Advanced Integrated Module	Cisco	AIM-IPS-K9	1<BR>6	Cisco - IPS SVC AR NBD AIM-IPS-K9	Cisco	CON-SU1-AIMIPSK9	1<BR>7	WAAS Network Module For 2800, 3800 ISR - 1GB RAM, 120GB HDD	Cisco	NME-WAE-502-K9	1<BR>8	Cisco WAAS 4.1 NM SW image (separate license required)	Cisco	SF-WAAS-4.1-NM-K9	1<BR>9	Cisco WAAS Enterprise License for 1 NME model 502 or 522	Cisco	WAAS-ENT-NM	1<BR>10	Catalyst 3560 24 10-100-1000T PoE plus 4 SFP plus IPS Image (220v,50Hz)	Cisco	WS-C3560G-24PS-E	1<BR>11	MGE UPS Switched PDU 8 NM 1U (220v,50Hz)	MGE	68130	1<BR><BR>3.3 Geographical Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) with two LCD color monitors for the driver & staff.

<CONTACT>CHERI K. WICKS

<a href="mailto:cheri.wicks@va.gov">Contracting Officer's email</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for subject fee reimbursement  coordination, audit, and management.  A fixed price contract with a base of March 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009 with four (4) options is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only the Boston VA Research Institute (BVARI) possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: The agency is the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The activity is the Boston VA Medical Center.2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:The nature of the action is a sole source solicitation to Boston VA Research Institute, Inc. (BVARI) for research subject fee reimbursement.3.  The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):Various research entities within the VA Boston Healthcare System need a service to pay, monitor, audit, and ensure compliance with Federal income tax regulations, for when research subjects receive compensation of travel and project related expenditures.The estimated total value of this service is $99,999.00 or approximately $14,285.57/month for the initial base period.  4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source5.  Demonstration of the contractor's unique qualifications:Based on sensitive, protected health information (PHI) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requirements, it has been established that BVARI be responsible for these costs (See Public Law:  45CFR160.10, 45CFR164.501 and PL 104-191:  HIPAA).  BVARI has established a mechanism to provide these subject payments while in compliance with VA IT Security issues, HIPAA requirements as well as IRS regulations.6.  Description of efforts made to ensure notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:This requirement is expected to exceed $25, 000 and in accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1) a notice will be posted through FBO.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:	Subject fee reimbursements range between a minimum of $100 and maximum of $5,000.  The fees are determined by the study size.  Sufficient reviews and audits are in place to ensure fees paid are fair and reasonable.  Additionally, BVARI is a non-profit institute and as such will not be charging any overhead.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:To ensure regulatory compliance, this acquisition is required to be placed with BVARI; no market research was conducted.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available:	Requirements for research endeavors are very specific in nature and frequently there is only one responsible source. There is little the agency could do to open this requirement to competition since it is a requirement of Title 38 that awards be made to affiliated institutions.10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:	None to date.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:	This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY

This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing integration services to support the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program.  
The mission of the CTR Program is partnering with willing countries world-wide to reduce the threat of WMD and related materials, technology, and expertise, including providing for the safe destruction of WMD, associated delivery systems, and related infrastructure.  Historically, CTR partners included states of the Former Soviet Union, but recent legislation has broadened the program worldwide.  Systems engineering practices and procedures are a critical component of these complex engineering projects, beginning from the design stage through project close out.  The CTR Program continues to dismantle and eliminate strategic weapons delivery systems and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology, materials, and expertise.  The CTR program also facilitates defense and military contacts to encourage military reductions and reform.  In the FY 2010 budget request, the Department of Defense expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the Global War on Terrorism.

In FY 2001, the CTR Program awarded the current CTR Integrating Contract (CTRIC), an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to five integrating contractors to support the CTR Program.  The ordering period ends on 06 September 2011, with all on-going work to be completed NLT 06 September 2012.  Future ID/IQ task orders whose durations are not appropriate to the period of performance of the existing CTRIC contract are expected to be awarded under a new contract.  In FY 2008, the CTR Program awarded a separate ID/IQ contract to support its Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).  
In anticipation of the sunset of the current CTRIC in 2012, DTRA anticipates soliciting a multiple-source capability for an integrated approach to support the CTR Program in its non-BTRP operations and programs.  The maximum value of the proposed acquisition is currently estimated at $800M over a ten-year period (initial five-year contract with a possible five-year option award term based on performance.)  
The projected start date is January 2010.  Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas. 

Provision of safe, secure, efficient, and accurate planning, organizing, management, integration, systems engineering, reporting, operations, maintenance, logistics, construction, eradication, decommissioning, extraction, dismantlement, handling, and transportation support to accomplish the following tasks outside of the United States;

Provide expertise on WMD non-proliferation and sponsor collaborative efforts between WMD development experts and their respective laboratory and research facilities;

Provide non-proliferation threat awareness and equipping, as well as non-proliferation and consequence management training and exercises;

Establish and maintain a comprehensive WMD detection and interdiction capability to promote interdiction of illicit trafficking in WMD and related materials;
 
Provide training needs assessments, curriculum development, and training support to fulfill contract objectives;

Assist in the development/update of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for nations receiving CTR assistance;

Expeditiously perform CTR support tasks including travel support for government and contractor personnel, transportation of materials to partner sites, warehouse management, equipment and maintenance support, or short term procurement, construction, and renovation support for facilities and infrastructure required by the programs;

Eliminate WMD delivery systems and their support infrastructure (solid/liquid-fueled rockets and air-breathing weapons, bombers, submarines, and other platforms);

Dispose of the residual products and by-products of WMD delivery systems;

Eliminate WMD production facilities and their associated support infrastructure; 

Secure, store and account for sensitive items of WMD delivery systems and their warheads;

Design, estimate, construct, and demolish horizontal (e.g., trenching, roads and railroads) and vertical (e.g., buildings, bunkers, and towers) infrastructure identified in applicable task orders;

Provide vulnerability assessments, security enhancement recommendations, and implementation of USG-accepted enhancements at sensitive WMD sites/facilities;

Provide sustainment needs assessments including: maintenance and repair requirements, support equipment requirements, spare parts, logistics requirements, transportation, procedure requirements, or other related topics, as well as implementation of USG-accepted recommendations;

Provide assistance to the appropriate executive agent(s) or CTR designated representatives of CTR partner countries for the transport of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to designated locations/facilities for planned dismantlement.  Establish and verify schedules and performance of transport services as well as establish and maintain key relationships associated with movement of WMD;

Provide Subject Matter Experts with expertise in the transportation infrastructure of CTR partner countries capable of detailed investigation into tariffs, regulations, certifications, ad hoc support requests or to attend project meetings between government agencies relating to the movement of weapons of WMD and/or associated components;

Provide ability to establish and manage contract(s) with transportation vehicle maintenance facilitie(s) to conduct and verify maintenance as required to maintain applicable certifications relating to WMD transport vehicles and;

If authorized, apply CTR resources to the elimination of conventional arms, munitions and their associated infrastructure.

Contractors who believe that they posses the expertise and experience to fulfill all of these requirements and their complex systems engineering activities are invited to submit technical and management capabilities addressing each of these areas in writing.  Interested contractors should also address whether they can fulfill the requirements via GSA schedules.  Please send responses via e-mail to CTRC_INFO@dtra.mil by close of business on 12 March 09.  Please limit your response to no more than five pages (size: 8.5x 11 pages, with 1 margins), using Times New Roman 12 pt font or equivalent, and submitted in Microsoft Word 2003 or Adobe PDF formats.  Also include information such as: Company name, address, email, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and whether your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. (4) Is your firm a certified HUBZone firm (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned.  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. All information received in this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Agency currently intends to host an Industry Day conference on 24 March 2009.  The purpose of the conference is to provide additional information on CTR requirements and give industry an opportunity to seek further information on the acquisition.  Additional information regarding this conference will be posted on both DTRA and FBO.gov websites (links will be provided in a subsequent modification to this announcement).  Specific information such as date, time, and number of allotted people per company will be addressed in the upcoming Industry Day announcement. In order to gauge the amount of interest for Industry Day, please send your company name, point of contact, phone, and e-mail address to CTRC_INFO@dtra.mil.

<DESC>ADVANCED TOPOGRAPHIC LASER ALTIMETER SYSTEM (ATLAS)REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONThis notice is issued by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to post a Request forInformation (RFI) via the Internet to solicit responses from interested parties.  THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION FOR BID NOTICE.This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry theopportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well aspromote competition.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall beconsidered by the Agency.The NASA/ GSFC intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the manufacture of atelescope to meet the requirements of the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System(ATLAS) aboard the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-II (ICESat-2).  ATLAS ispreceded by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat-I launched in 2003and it is the second in a series to accurately measure the ice thickness and temporalchanges of the ice thickness in Antarctica and Greenland.   GLAS telescope information is provided for reference:  funded and developed by NASA, theGLAS instrument telescope was a medium aperture, narrow field, optical telescopeoperating as a receiver at 1064nm wavelength. The telescope assembly was a classicalCassegrain.  The one-meter aperture Primary mirror efl was 700mm and the overall efl was3924mm with a bfd of 98mm.  This yields a telescope f/#: f/3.92.  It was an all-Berylliumdesign with flight heritage CIRS, MOLA, GLAS and CALIPSO.  The metering structure wasbrazed with four blades, base ring and a stiffening tube which also serves as an innerlight baffle.  The external baffle prevents direct illumination of the detectors by thesun.  The metering structure was rigidly mounted on the center of the primary mirror.  Astrong interface plate was mounted on the back of the primary mirror to provide rigidityduring diamond turning and for mounting with flexures to the spacecraft.  The operatingtemperature was room temperature.  The image quality of the telescope was deliberatelylow: 10 times diffraction limited.We expect nearly identical requirements for the ATLAS telescope to be provided in theRFP.   The ICESat-2 mission is expected to be launched in 2014 into a sun-synchronouspolar orbit at 600km altitude and operate for a minimum of three years.  The assemblydrawing of the GLAS telescope is attached.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing nolater than February 25, 2009. Qualified organizations must demonstrate experience andcapability in working with Beryllium metal.   The coating and polishing shall be doneoff-site at the vendor's facility.  The Beryllium has been ordered by the government andwill be GFE provided to the successful telescope vendor.  Qualified organizations shouldalso describe their capability to provide optical test data proving that the telescopecomplies with the requirements in the RFP.Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated to determine how the Government willprocure this item.  Based upon responses to this notice, the Government will determinethe appropriate method of acquiring.This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will theGovernment pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about April 1, 2009 with an anticipatedoffer due date of on or about May 1, 2009.Information may be submitted via mail to: NASA/GSFC, ATTN: Mayra A.

The NHTSA has been using the proprietary Claritas, Inc PRIZM and PRIZMNE lifestyle, socio-geo-demographic/psychographic segmentation system for more than 15 years and relies on this proprietary system and databases for complex research and assessment of traffic safety problems, program needs, deployment of state and regional resources to reach critical targets --impaired drivers, people who do not always wear seatbelts, motorcycles, etc. 

 In 2007, when NHTSA began to investigate venturing beyond traditional media and into the online/web world, NHTSA found that Claritas, Inc. had partnered with Hitwise, Inc. to extend PRIZM and PRIZMNE lifestyle assessment into the online internet world.  Hitwise has enabled NHTSA to extend its ongoing research and communications activity into the online world. For the past 2 years, NHTSA has looked at various key target groups, such as young men 18-34 who are likely to be involved in impaired driving, and note where they reside in the web world, in parallel to NHTSAs related study of where these men reside in the actual physical world. The knowledge of where different groups can be found in the online world is part of key market research involved in creating and redesigning NHTSAs website and other related IT activities.

The contractor, Hitwise, Inc. has a partnership with Internet service Providers (ISPs) to collect data from Proxy Servers.  Hitwise reports on 10 million US internet users per day.  The data are collected in aggregate: individuals can not be identified nor tracked.  The extensive size of Hitwises sample eliminates skewed results which can occur with other companies which rely upon small opt-in user panels to individually track and monitor small sets of internet users.  Companies which use that type of website traffic collection system are open to skewed data from small number of people who have agreed to be monitored and tracked individually.


PURPOSE
Contractor shall provide annual subscription service to the Hitwise.com website, which provides market research tools for on line, website, and assessment including a partnership with Claritas, Inc. which extends its proprietary PRIZM/PRIZMNE lifestyle soci-geo-demographic market research to the online world.

The Hitwise subscription is web based, involves no software, nor coding. 

Hitwise.com is a partner of Claritas, Inc. and uses Claritas PRIZMNE segmentation system to analyze the online geography or where audience lives in the online world.

In addition, the Contractor shall provide, by way of its licensed site, access to click stream data, ranking of websites across 169+ categories, search intelligence, industry statistics, charting, ranking alerts, media alerts, custom reports, paid vs. organic search, Information on new and returning visitors, 36 months of historical data.

This announcement is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation will be issued.  Offers from concerns other than Hitwise USA, Inc. are not being solicited.  The government point of contact for this action is Vincent Lynch, Contract Specialist, phone 202-366-3339, email: vincent.lynch@dot.gov.

The NIAID anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement type contract; the NAICS code is 541990, size standard is $7M. The contractor will be required to furnish all the necessary services, personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provide by the Government. The contractor will provide an estimated 80 hours per week (which includes the time spent on site "on call") of professional services for each postgraduate medical resident. The residents will be required to perform the following duties: (1) Provide primary medical care for the NIAID, DIR, clinical research adult and pediatric patients as assigned by the DIR Clinical Director or his designee. (2) Perform an initial evaluation on each new patient, including medical history (review of chart) and physical examination with six hours after the patients has been admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. (3) Enter admission notes into the Electronic Signature Application for each patient; and enter pertinent medical orders into the Clinical Research Information System. (5) Attend and participate in patient care rounds, attend lectures, and provide in-hours medical coverage. In addition, all residents will receive training on the NIH medical information system and clinical research protocols including (but not limited to) Privacy, Security Awareness Training, Electronic Signature Authentication and SISWEB for anesthesia requests. Each resident will rotate on call every 4th night; this will require the resident to stay in the NIH Clinical Center for a 24-hour shift. The total requirement is for an estimated 320 hours weekly and 16,640 hours yearly. Any potential offerors should respond with a capability statement by February 25, 2009, 11:00 am EDT.

<DESC>The US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Weapon Systems and Technology Directorate, Direct Fire Infantry Weapons System Division, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, has a need for evaluating applicability of boron coating to small caliber weapons components. This surface treatment/coating may offer the potential of replacing certain legacy coatings (hard chrome, heavy phosphate) currently utilized on infantry weapons. This effort will include coating samples from the following steels: 1015-1018, 1040-1060, 4130-4150, 9310H, low alloy steel used on gun barrels (composition of the alloy will be supplied). Recommendation would also be sought in terms of steel alloys best suitable for boronizing to obtain required properties (hardness, coefficient of friction, corrosion resistance).  Required capabilities include boronizing steel parts (sizes of approximately 2  18 in long) of irregular shapes, and the inside a of 5.5 mm ID (.21 in) and approximately .875 in OD steel tube that is 19 in long. Boronizing process should not distort the dimensional accuracy of the parts. It is desired that the process be performed at a temperature of 850C or lower. Parts will most likely need to be heat treated after boronizing, to obtain required hardness. 

Interested Offerors shall provide, at no cost to the Government, information on their capabilities to perform the aforementioned tasks.  In addition, interested Offerors shall provide a summary of the personnel skill levels, equipment, and facilities to include technical knowledge, experience, and areas of expertise relevant to topic area. 

All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government; information provided will not be returned.  Responses should be limited to no more than twenty-five (35) pages with a minimum font of Arial size 10.  All responsible, interested Offerors are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification data and any pertinent information via email, or electronically, NO LATER THAN 10 March 2009.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept written questions by email.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />The 99th Range Wing located at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, NV 89191 requires renewal of its Joint Range Extension (JRE) help desk support. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to L-3 Communications Titan Corporation of 3033 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121.. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@nellis.af.mil or fax 702-652-5405, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Wednesday, 18 February 2009; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>The Joint Range Extension (JRE) Gateway utilizes a proprietary operating system/software to perform its core functions that are necessary to conduct tactical data link operations on the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). Due to the proprietary nature of the source code of the operating software, L3 Communications, Titan Group, is the only vendor that can provide help desk support and software upgrades for the system. The 98 Range Wing currently employs 7 JRE systems, valued at an estimated $600 thousand on the NTTR. If other sources were used instead of the specified vendor, all of these systems would have to be replaced. The estimated cost to replace the JRE system with a similar system would exceed $1 Million (based on the average cost of like systems). There would be a substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through full and open competition. In addition, there is no other known system that would meet all of the mission requirements of the JRE.</p>

Interested parties may e-mail alyson.gowin@macdill.af.mil not later than Friday, 13 February 2009; 3:00 p.m. EST.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within three days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />DLT Solutions has been identified by the manufacturer of these software products as the sole government re-seller. Autodesk Architectural Desktop, Map 3D, and Raster Design software have already been tested and certified to work in the ISP environment, and they are the only SOCOM-approved architectural software applications that fall under the ISP Programs Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP). The software is currently installed and in use at USSOCOM. To solicit for another software source at this point would result in delays and users unable to meet mission requirements. Furthermore, the users are already trained on how to use Autodesk software. At this time, it is not economically feasible to evaluate other software brands, or to alter the current system configuration. This would only duplicate the research and integration that was already accomplished. Cost to replace this software with another brand is not expected to be recovered through competition. Replacement cost is estimated at $23,472.60 (or higher), which would be a 57% (or more) increase.</p>

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration with The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) for Urinary Incontinence Exercise Programs  

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaboration with industry or non-profit organizations to provide exercise programs to be used in a NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trial in women with urinary incontinence undergoing fitness, exercise, and education training program in their communities. 

IINTRODUCTION:	The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaborations with Industry, Corporations, and Non-Profit Organizations to provide exercise teaching programs and fitness educational material in both general fitness and pelvic floor specific exercises for women with stress urinary incontinence. The trial will be a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of community-dwelling women with urinary incontinence who agree to participate in one of 2, 11-12 week community based fitness programs: (1) one aimed at general health and fitness; and (2) one which incorporates exercises and behavior training for the pelvic floor and bladder in addition to general health and fitness.  

STUDY GOALS:  Primary study goal is to identify if differences exist in resolution of urinary incontinence symptoms in women participating in an 11-12 week, fitness and education program directed at pelvic health when compared to women participating in a similar program directed at general fitness and health. This study is within the UITNs primary mission of conducting clinical trials to forward research in urinary incontinence.  

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2000, the NIDDK established the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN).  The purpose of the UITN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials of urinary incontinence.  The UITN has completed three trials, the first comparing two surgical procedures for women with stress urinary incontinence, A Randomized Clinical Trial of the Burch Modified Tanagho and Autologous Fascia Sling Procedures. The second trial compared adding behavioral therapy to patients on pharmaceutical drugs to test if patients can discontinue drugs sooner and have a sustained effect, the Behavior Enhanced Drug Reduction of Incontinence Trial (BE-DRI).  The third trial is a surgical trial, comparing two different approaches for mid-urethral slings,   Retropubic Mid-urethral Sling (RMUS) vs. Transobturator Mid-Urethral Sling (TOMUS).  

This proposed protocol for comparing exercises has been recently approved by the  UITN Steering committee and reviewed by an independent NIDDK-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  

The two-armed study will enroll approximately 230 women with 135 women randomized into each arm.  Follow up will occur at the end of class and at one year.  Enrollment will occur at nine participating clinical centers (William Beaumont Hospital, Loyola University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of California at San Diego; University of Maryland, University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas at Dallas; University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Utah). Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the New England Research Institutes.  Although the patient recruitment is anticipated to begin in the spring to summer 2009, the collaborator(s) will, nonetheless, have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol.  It is anticipated that the duration of this trial will be at least  one  year, with a three-six month recruitment period. The collaborator(s) will need to provide exercise programs, training for their exercise program for fitness trainers, and educational programs as needed.  The Collaborator(s) is (are) expected to provide the products and training for free without charge. The Collaborator(s) may have access to information about the outcome of the study at the same time as the participating investigators.  A Collaborative Agreement between the NIDDK and the Collaborator(s) will need to be executed prior to shipment of the products or placement kits or surgical instruments. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The UITN Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements to aid in their selection of collaborator(s).  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the UITN Steering Committee through their capability statements.  Organizations can apply to provide either exercise program or both. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative (not including appendices) and should address the following selection criteria: 

(1) Details on the type and goals of the exercise program to be offered. 
(2) Detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantity of exercise program and for providing adequate training on use of the exercise program. 
(3) Detailed methodology of the fitness program, duration, and effectiveness of the exercise program with the intended goals of either general fitness or pelvic floor specific exercise. 
(4) Detailed plan of commitment to collaborate in the trial for the duration of the trial and willingness to promptly publish research results. 
(5) Detailed listing of the educational materials available and fitness accessories (if applicable) to accompany the fitness program. 
(6) Detailed plan to train fitness instructors at all the multi-clinical sites of this network to teach the exercise program. Plan can include instructional videos or a multi-day in-person instruction at the beginning, followed by up to 4 follow up in-person visit. 
(7) A description of the methods that would be used to assure patient privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.
(8) The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measured and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment of stress urinary incontinence. 

SUBMISSION DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before April 10, 2009 will be considered.  Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicants own expense to discuss with the UITN Steering Committee their plans and capabilities pertinent to the study  either with a teleconference or at a in-person meeting of the UITN Steering Committee to be held in the Spring of 2009 in the Baltimore-Washington, DC area.

TERMS:	The selected Collaborator(s) will be expected to execute a collaborative agreement.  No funding from the government is available.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">(1). Introduction</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The existing XP24K Disk Array (SN:
45281) located at San Antonio
is currently being maintained by the original awarded vendor, </span><span>Hewlett Packard</span><span style="color: black;">.<span>&nbsp; </span>The products and services meet
the storage functional objectives stated by the customer and DISA.<span>&nbsp; </span>The proposed solution meets all interface and
communications requirements set forth by DISA.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">(2). Because the existing XP25K
Disk Array system was awarded to Hewlett Packard, this vendor has unique and
detailed knowledge of the current system and proposed solution and the
equipment configuration management requirements for successful movement and
migration of this asset.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">(3). Award to any source other
than Hewlett Packard would result in voiding the current warranty on the asset and
resulting in additional costs to DISA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Savings
will be realized by not replacing the existing array, which cost over $200k to
replace and is still fully functional, scalable, and supportable.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">(4). Accordingly, as stated in
items 1, 2, and 3 above, Hewlett Packard is the only vendor capable s</span>anitizing,
De-Installation, Packing, Shipping, Un-Packing, Re-Installation and ensuring
proper operation of the <span style="color: black;">XP24K Disk Array (SN: 45281) </span>from

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award to One SourceThe VA intends to award a sole-source task order to EDGE Systems, Inc. off of their GSA schedule for annual software maintenance and database support for the VAs TIMS system, which uses the IMEDGE software product, for a 1-year base plus four 1-year options.  POC for this requirement is Angela Deren 512-326-6662, e-mail Angela.Deren@va.gov  The GSA Limited Sources Justification follows:LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE ORDERSFAR 8.405-6(b)(1)1.  Contracting ActivityDepartment of Veterans AffairsIT Acquisition Center (200/00D)Center for Acquisition Innovation-Austin1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX  787722.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This acquisition will be a firm, fixed price task order for the Technical and Database Support and Software Maintenance for the Image Management System (TIMS).  The period of performance is a base year, commencing on the date of award, plus four 12-month option periods. The estimated cost of the base year is $266,234.00.  The total estimated cost of the contract is $1,375,634.00.3.  Description of Supplies or Service:  This acquisition is for the purchase of technical support and maintenance services for the database support for TIMS. TIMS is a critical application that supports the processing of Education benefits.  These benefits are administered at four RPOs: Atlanta, GA; Buffalo, NY; Muskogee, OK; and St. Louis, MO.  A fifth system is maintained at the Hines ITC for training, and testing & development (T&D).    4.  Identification of the Justification Rationale:  VA has developed a sole source environment by contracting with EDGE Systems to use their proprietary software that was developed to run TIMS. Edge Systems, Inc., using their IMEDGE product, developed TIMS in FY 96 at the request of and for the use of the VA.  In 1999 TIMS was redeveloped into a 32-bit architecture for process improvements.  Since that time, maintenance contracts have been awarded on a sole-source basis in order to keep the software and hardware updated because only EDGE systems can maintain their software.  Data contained in TIMS is the property of VA, however, the software that is owned by EDGE, is the only means by which to access this data. It is necessary to keep the software maintained to keep it updated and functioning properly.  In the event this contract is not awarded, the system will not be available for the VBAs use to access the data.  As a result, claims processing will cease due to the inability to access the data, preventing benefit payments to veterans and dependents.  5.  Best Value Determination:  This procurement is for a firm fixed price award.  GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing is not necessary, except for a price evaluation as required by FAR 8.405-2(d). By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in 8.405, the VA contracting office has concluded that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR 2.101) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Governments needs. Although GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, the VA contracting office will seek additional discounts before placing an order (see 8.405-4).   6.  Description of Market Research:  No efforts were made to solicit other offerors.  The VA has developed a proprietary environment by allowing one contractor to do the work in support of TIMS using their proprietary software.  Choosing another vendor would result in a risk to the integrity of the data, duplication of effort, a significant learning curve, and delay in deliverable of products in a timely manner.  The proposed vendor is available on GSA schedule.7.  Other Supporting Data:  The last maintenance contract that was awarded for this effort was 101-Y47027, with a period of performance of October 1, 2003 thru March 30, 2009.  8.  Future barriers to competition:  This is a follow on contract for one year, with four 12-month option periods to provide continued maintenance support, until the replacement software system can be developed and deployed.  A new software system is being developed at this time.  It is understood that the proper contract clauses will be included in the new procurement so that the VA will not be put into this type of non-competitive situation again.

<p><strong>Evaluation Criteria:<br /></strong><br />Government intends to make award to the offeror who provides the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal and is deemed eligible and responsible for the award. As such, the award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.<br /><br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to seek clarifications and / or conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>After the solicitation period has expired, all proposals will be given to the evaluation team to rate as either "technically acceptable" or "technically unacceptable." If determined to be technically unacceptable, no further evaluation will be performed. Then, the Contracting Officer will rank order all "technically acceptable" proposals by price--from the lowest priced to the highest priced. Finally, the government will evaluate past performance.

<p>The following factors and levels of importance shall be used to evaluate the responses:<br />Factor One (1) has a greater weight than Factor Two (2).

<p><strong>(1) Conformance to the SON (Technical Proposal)</strong></p>
<p>The technical proposal shall demonstrate the ability to satisfy requirements described in the SON. Technical proposals shall demonstrate capability, understanding, and program management required to meet the needs of the Government.</p>

In addition, provide the contracting agency (or company, if commercial), a point of contact, an address, and the telephone number.</p>
<p>The Government will rate the offeror's past performance as either favorable or unfavorable; however in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and therefore receive a neutral rating.</p>

Reference the following links for additional information:<br />Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635: <br />2002 CFR Title 5, Volume 3<br />Conflict of Interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code: <br />Title 18 United States Code<br />Financial Disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/5cfr2634_05.html<br />The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (See Sec. 9, Clause 8): http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html <br />3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad): <br />http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/85177.pdf<br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.<br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.<br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.<br />8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.<br />h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws.<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).<br />i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br />b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.<br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.<br />3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.<br />b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html<br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.<br />j.

The initial evaluation will take place 6 months after contract award and each subsequent evaluation will be performed annually 12 months from the date of the initial evaluation, and each year thereafter on a recurring 12 month schedule. A final evaluation will be performed at contract completion. The Performance Based Matrix included in this contract as Attachment 1 will serve as the basis for evaluation. A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.<br />k.

STATEMENT OF WORK

SCOPE:

The vendor(s) shall provide training and other relevant instructional support for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technology Services Organization (TSO) Indianapolis.  The primary objective of this requirement is to gain security certification required by DOD Instruction (DODI) 8570.01 and maximize the passing rate for employees completing the Global Information Assurance Certification Information (GIAC) Security Fundamentals (GISF) certification examination administered by the SANS Institute.  Services to be provided include the delivery of instructor-led, on-site training by qualified instructor(s), the provision of training materials, and the provision of post-training support.  

Global Information Assurance Certification
 

BACKGROUND:

DFAS provides full service finance and accounting services to the Uniformed Military Services and other Department of Defense (DoD) activities.  These services include accounting, military and civilian payroll, contract payment processing, travel reimbursement and payments, and many other services directly related to the financial management of the DoD workforce.

DFAS operations are worldwide.  Major business functional processing centers are located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; Rome, New York; and Limestone, Maine.  

DoD and DFAS senior management are placing increased emphasis on the workforce attaining professional certifications relevant to the organization.  For government security and information technology professionals, the DODI 8570.01 has identified certifications of particular importance that are mandatory to retain employment in that field.  DFAS has required that the certifications be completed by December 2010.  Examination preparation training and other support provided by the contractor will be an important component in ensuring the employees success.    
 
REQUIREMENTS:

Availability of Training Course, Materials, Instructors and Other Support

DFASs objective is for all student participants to pass the GISF Certification Examination within 4 months of the training.  In support of this objective, the contractor will have available and be authorized to deliver in an instructor-led, classroom environment, a commercial off-the-shelf training course to prepare students to take and pass the GISF Certification Examination.    
DFAS recognizes each student will need to spend considerable time on individual study in addition to time spent in the classroom.  Therefore, DFAS is interested in the following information being provided with your quote (in support of classroom and self study training):

     Describe in detail how you would deliver training to support DFASs objective; including post-class support (format, length of course, hours of training involved, non-classroom support such as: on-line support, software, simulations, sample test questions, practice exams, etc.) .
     Describe if lectures/classes are available for a period of time before and/or after the class and, if so, for how long and in what format, e.g., on-line, video, CD.  This item includes access to GISF On Demand training to complete the exercises required prior to attempting the examination for a period of up to four months and two weeks after the instructor-led training.
     Describe the provisions that you will make for remedial training when students fail to pass an examination.  Describe any provision that you make for a student to repeat a class and/or examination.  Indicate where remedial training will be provided, e.g., at the DFAS site where the original training was conducted or at another site in the local community.
     Describe your success rate and how you determined it. 
     Describe any guarantees that you provide for success.
     Instructors should be subject matter experts in the areas of instruction.  They should also have considerable experience in successfully facilitating GISF examination preparation training.
     Describe how the instructor(s) who will be delivering the training meet these requirements.

The use of subcontractor(s) requires prior approval by the DFAS Contracting Officer.

The government will make every effort to provide as much advance notice of the required class as possible.  However, the contractor must be capable of facilitating training no later than thirty calendar days following notice of a need to conduct a training class.

The government may cancel a class within 14 calendar days from the scheduled convening date without incurring additional costs.


DELIVERABLES (1)  (3):

(1) Delivery of Instructor-Led Training

During the lifecycle of this contract, it is anticipated that instructor-led training will be presented at DFAS at Indianapolis, Indiana. 

The contractor shall deliver instructor-led training scheduled as requested by DFAS in accordance with its quote.  

The contractor shall be responsible for providing all course materials.  The contractor shall also be responsible for bearing any costs associated with the reproduction/distribution of student materials.  

A minimum of 15 students and a maximum of 25 students will participate in this requirement.  It is anticipated that class size will be twenty five students.
 
The contractor shall provide a laptop computer for the instructor to facilitate the presentation of instructional materials.  Access to DFAS computer equipment and/or operating systems will not be needed.

The contractor shall be responsible for distributing a class roster (provided by DFAS) to enable students to formally document their attendance.

(2) Delivery of On Demand Training

On Demand training will be available for students to access for a period of four months after the registering for the On Demand exam.  The students should register for this training within two weeks of completing the instructor-led training.  The registration should also simultaneously include registration for the four month examination preparation period.  Students will have access to the On Demand training from both DFAS and alternate sites using conventional Internet access and should be able to complete the exercises required as a prerequisite to the examination.  Those students who do not register for the On Demand training must register for the four month examination preparation period within two weeks of completing the instructor-led training.  All On Demand training, tools, and help will be available for those who have registered for it.  This online aid includes a virtual mentor, exercises, pre-assessment tests, and web based courseware.  This is more than just reviewing briefing charts.  The On Demand training account will be deleted after the student has successfully completed the GISF examination.

The contractor shall be responsible for providing all course materials.  The contractor shall also be responsible for bearing any costs associated with the On Demand training.

(3) Delivery of Certification Examination

The contractor shall also be responsible for bearing any costs associated with the examination.  If subsequent examinations are required due to unsuccessful attempts, the vendor needs to make the examination available; however, the student would bear any additional fees.  Two additional examination attempts may be made, with each attempt having a thirty day extension from the original registration expiration (not of the registration purchase).    

(4) The contractor shall deliver an additional pre-assessment test before the exam.

Government personnel will provide assistance with coordinating receipt of training materials, preparation of the classroom, and any other necessary liaison functions. 
The government shall be responsible for providing the contractor with pertinent contact information for on-site personnel (name, phone number, etc.).  This information will be provided prior to performing work under the contract.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number FA7000-09-T-0030, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 &amp; 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-29, 14 Nov 08.

All responsible sources may submit a response, which if received timely, will be considered by the 10th Contracting Division.

<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement. The 10th Medical Group has determined the TRC-NW8 to be the only product that meets all its required features and functionality based on the following justification.

The camera does not require film allowing medical technicians to load digital photos into AHLTA. The camera allows photography of most patients without dilation of the eyes. This feature can reduce downtime for pilots and ensure wartime capability while obtaining necessary documentation for RVU gain. Furthermore, a separate slit lamp camera, anterior segment, will not be needed. <br /><br />Delivery is to be made to the 10th Medical Group at the U.S. Air Force Academy, CO 80840, FOB Point: Destination.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-29.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation, NAICS code 334516, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This action is designated as a 100% small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order to acquire a  Digital Microscope.  Due to the nature of the research being conducted for anti-coring properties of Huber needles, the Contractors equipment must meet the Technical Specifications as outlined below.  Please reference the specifications listed below before submitting offers on this solicitation.  

SPECIFICATIONS:

A digital microscope is needed as an essential component to be utilized as a testing apparatus for the field investigation of Huber needles anti-coring property.  It is essential the microscope possess a large depth of field for evaluation purposes and contractors may submit offers for new or demo model equipment, providing the equipment meets the desired specifications. 

The digital microscope must conform to the following key specification:

1.  Magnification, at least: 6 to 320 times.

2.  Depth of Field, at least: 13.3 to 0.25 mm for magnification of 20 to 160 times.

3.  Light Source:  Metal Halide Arc.

The depth of field (DOF) is the portion of a scene that appears sharp in the image. Although a lens can precisely focus at only one distance, the decrease in sharpness is gradual on either side of the focused distance, so that within the DOF, the sharpness is greater for under normal viewing conditions.  
The lighting of the research subject is critical for observations of nearly transparent objects such as silicone cores that we are trying to see in our present research.  State-of-the-art light sources use Metal Halide Arc lighting which produces a light beam with a spectrum almost identical to the normal sun light.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0032 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-29, effective January 19, 2009 & 2005-30, effective 15 Jan 2009. This is a Brand Name requirement and the Justification and Approval required by FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name descriptions, has been executed. This is a 100% small business set-aside under NAICS 611420 with a size standard of $7.0 million. The Government reserves the right to issue an order following evaluation of initial quotes without discussions. Evaluation and order issuance will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. An order will be issued to the vendor whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government. Best value for this order will be obtained through a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation. BACKGROUND: The National Archives and Records Administrations (NARA) Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum possesses an entire digital collection of papers, documents, photographs and audio recordings of President John F. Kennedy. This is made possible by the Digital Asset Management System which is housed in two separate equipment racks; Centera storage system (rack one) and Clariion system (rack two). The software systems running the Clariion and Centera systems include: Application Xtender, Web Xtender, and Disk Xtender which are proprietary to the EMC Software Group. An upgrade of the existing EMC software systems is scheduled for spring 2009. The two newly assigned archivists to this project require on-line training on this software as well as on-line training on the pre-existing EMC hardware. Due to the proprietary nature of the hardware/software it has been determined that only EMC or one of its partner companies can provide the aforementioned required on-line training. This on-line training includes; Technical Fundamentals of Documentum, System Administration for Documentum- Fundamentals and Captiva: InputAccel Fundamentals & Administration. For more information on the requested on-line training please see Attachment 1. REQUIREMENTS: This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price RFQ and all delivery costs should be included in total estimated value.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.

The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in Louisiana intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) to small business sources capable of providing technical reviews of appraisals for conservation easements.  This is a Total Small Business Set Aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 531320, with a business size standard of $2.0M.  The contractor shall furnish all appraisal services according to the specifications incorporated with this solicitation.  The technical review appraiser must be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser in good standing.  The technical reviews must be completed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and supplemental instructions as provided by the NRCS.

The NRCS envisions entering into Multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) with qualified offerors capable of providing technical reviews of appraisals.  A BPA is a method of filling anticipated needs.  It is not a contract.  The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders.  For each work assignment, the Government will request technical reviews through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded BPA's.

Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA's.  Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA's by name and telephone number.  The contractor will be expected to furnish the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order.

Timely delivery of complete and accurate technical review reports is crucial to the success of NRCS programs.  Call orders are to be completed within 14 days of the call order date.  If the contractor is unable to provide the technical review report within the 14 day period, NRCS is to be notified; otherwise, it is expected to receive the technical review report within 14 business days.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Technical review services are being sought for a period of five years with a contract period of March 1, 2009 to September 30, 2014.  The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.

STANDARDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  1) Must be a State Certified General Appraiser in good standing; 2) The technical reviewer must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting technical reviews.

A copy of the technical reviewer's state license or practice permit shall be submitted at the time of bid submission.  If the contractor elects to sub-contract the technical review work, the sub-contractor must also be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser.  Proof of the sub-contractor's qualifications and license must be supplied at the time of bid submission.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army INSCOM Technology Application Division (TAD) has a requirement to perform digital<BR>photography training for the intelligence and counterintelligence community with class sizes limited to 12 students per<BR>class. In order to maintain this service it is necessary to replace aging, outdated and damaged (as result of a 2006 fire)<BR>equipment with state-of-the-art gear that represents technology currently available on the market. Based on mission and<BR>operational requirements the selected camera to be used needed to have certain characteristics. It must be compact,<BR>rugged, high resolution, zoom and wide angle capabilities, usable video capability, LCD viewfinder, as well as an<BR>optical viewfinder and extended battery life.<BR>A market survey was performed to identify possible cameras that have these requirements and 4 potential candidates<BR>were identified, the Panasonic LX3, Nikon P6000, Ricoh R10 and the Canon GIO. A comparison of the characteristics<BR>of each of these cameras was performed and the Canon Powershot G10 proved to be the overall best candidate for our<BR>requirements. The G10 is an advanced compact camera possessing a rugged magnesium shell, 14.7 megapixel sensor, a<BR>28 to 140MM lens with stabilized optics, 3 inch LCD with 460k resolution, optical viewfinder, 640 x 480,30 frames per<BR>second video capability and a 1050 mA Lithium-Ion battery capable of taking over 380 pictures.<BR>Based upon the results of this market survey it is recommend that 12 Canon Powershot G10 Digital Cameras along with<BR>12 each of the following accessories, Canon TC-DC58D Tele Converters, Canon LA-DC58K Lens Adapters and<BR>Canon 430EX II/USA Speedlites be purchased to support TAD's Digital Photography Training requirement. The TCDC58D<BR>Teleconverter converts the focal distance of the G10 body lens to 196mm at the telephoto end when attached to<BR>the camera. In order to accomplish a conversion lens adapter, Canon LA-DC58K is needed to attach the teleconverter to<BR>the G10 Camera. The Canon 430EX/II/USA Speedlite will enhance the flash photography capabilities of the GIO. The<BR>speedlit is a powerful shoe-mounted flash with a fast recycling time. Flash controls are set through the camera's LCD<BR>screen.<BR><BR>12ea  Canon Powershot G10 digital camera<BR><BR>12ea  Canon TC-DC58D TeleConverter f/G10/reg<BR><BR>12ea  Canon LA-DC58K Lens Adapter f/G10/reg<BR><BR>12ea  Canon Speedlite 430EX/USA<BR><BR>For more information contact: Contract Specialist Wayne V.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting proposals for initial purchase of ten (10)and up to 600 BAO Kit tactical headsets. This project is part of the broader Battlefield Airmen program, currently addressing requirements for combat control/special tactics and pararescue. This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items was prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation FA8629-09-R-2426 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), using the streamlined procedures for evaluation of commercial items as outlined in FAR 12.6. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28. The acquisition will be processed as a small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 334310. 2. Respondents to this RFP should submit a fact sheet and a bid for a tactical headset with the attributes listed on Attachment 1 to the RFP package. Please state what is included in the standard warranty for the tactical headset system. In addition, please state if higher level warranties are available, what they entail, and the costs associated with those warranties. In the event that this office determines to purchase a higher level warranty, that warranty will be included as a separate CLIN in the contract. 3. In addition to the initial quantity of ten tactical headsets, we a soliciting a bid for an addition purchase of up to 600 tactical headsets. These may be purchases as funding becomes available in the future. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount. This additional purchase will be place as an option in the ensuing contract. 4. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 5212-2, Evaluation - Commerical Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total cost for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). General statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement. Offerors shall complete and submit with each proposal FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications &ndash; Commercial Items and DFARS 242.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications &ndash; Commercial Items. 5.

Paper copies shall be clearly labeled &ldquo;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information&rdquo; on the cover sheets and in close proximity to this type of information, on each applicable page.

In addition, in accordance with FAR clause 52-212.01(d), two (2) tactical headsets shall be delivered to the program office CONCURRENT with your paper proposal for additional evaluation. After review is complete, the headsets shall be returned to the offeror. Please include name, address, and shipping information (including vendor&rsquo;s FedEx numbers) for the return of these items. 6. First delivery of ten tactical headsets is scheduled for 30 days after the contract is awarded. The place of delivery is listed in the model contract attached hereto.

<DESC>NAICS Code:  541620 Environmental Consulting Services, this is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and is designated as full and open competition.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Exposure Research Laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC (RTP), under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, on a fixed price basis, intends to purchase Scientific and Technical Consulting in support of a study that will collect needed data on selected green infrastructure technologies.
The EPA received questions pertaining to this requirement.  Here is a copy of the questions along with the answers to the questions:
1) Was the UWRRC involved in writing this solicitation? Answer:  No
2) Has there been any prequalification discussion of the firms and/or universities that might respond to the rfp? Answer:  No
3) Has a region of the US been selected for this work to occur?  For example, will the work occur in Region 5?   Answer:  No
4)  Under Phase 2: Bioretention Cell, item 1; what is the unit of measure for the minimum area of the bioretention facility?  Answer:  the unit measurement is ?Square Feet?
5)  Deliverables part 2. Quality Assurance states in part ?The contractor shall comply with all requirements as delineated in Attachment 1.?  Attachment 1 was not found with the solicitation.  Can you please provide me a copy of this attachment?  Answer:  Yes.  This will be provided along with the answers to the questions.
6)  Evaluation Criteria part A states in part ?The quotation shall not exceed ten pages (single sided), and a maximum of 12 point font.  Should ?maximum? actually be ?minimum??  Answer:  Yes, the font should be no smaller than 12 point font.
7)  Scope Phase 2 ? Bio Retention Cell - #1- is it 9 square feet?   Answer:  Yes, square feet.
8)  Is there a preference to where the roof systems and bio-retention cells should be located (referenced in Phase 1 and 2)?   Answer:  The location and description of benefits for such shall be at the offerors discretion.
9)  Would the EPA prefer that Phase 1 and 2 be accomplished in the same geographic location? Answer:  The geographical location shall be at the offerors discretion.
10)  Is a specific format required for the submittal? (i.e. Federal 330 Format).  Answer:  There is no specific format required.  EPA would like to see a readable and logical format.
11)  Are appendices allowed? Is that considered part of our 10 pages? Answer:  Yes appendices are allowed.  Attachments (for example:  resumes, drawings, specifications) are normally not considered under the 10 page restriction.
12)  Does EPA have a preferred location for the conference and if so where?  Answer:  The location and description of benefits for such shall be at the offerors discretion.
13)  What is the targeted length of the conference (1, 2, 3 days)?   Answer:  The anticipated length of the conference is three days.
14)  Are we allowed to charge a fee to attend the conference?   Answer:  Yes, however, the ?conference? portion of this requirement would have to be on a ?no cost? basis to the EPA.  In lieu of this, the contractor would be allowed to charge ?reasonable fees? to cover the cost of the conference facility, support services, expert presentations, working meals and light refreshments (including meals and light refreshments for non-federal attendees) and similar expenses.

15)  Is the contractor expected to pay the catering, conference room, and other logistically costs?   Answer: Yes, unless you want to bid this portion of the requirement on a ?no cost? basis.    This would allow the contractor to charge ?reasonable fees? to cover the cost of the conference facility, support services, expert presentations, working meals and light refreshments (including meals and light refreshments for non-federal attendees) and similar expenses.
16)  Does the contractor have the ability to leverage non-EPA funding sources for the international conference?  Yes, however, the ?conference? portion of this requirement would have to be on a ?no cost? basis to the EPA.  In lieu of this, the contractor would be allowed to charge ?reasonable fees? to cover the cost of the conference facility, support services, expert presentations, working meals and light refreshments (including meals and light refreshments for non-federal attendees) and similar expenses.
17)  Regarding "the contractor shall collect basic data on rainwater andstormwater runoff characteristics in the study watershed", please explain how the "study watershed" is defined.   And, what is meant by "basic data"?  Answer:  The interpretation of "study watershed" and "basic data" is at the offerer's discretion.  The ?study watershed? shall be defined as follows:  Within a 30 acre area surrounding the green roof/blue roof to be studied.  
18)  Is it permissible/desirable to have the roofs and/or bioretention cells loaded by a rainfall simulator?  (This arrangement would help achieve sufficient data collection to perform statistical analyses.) Answer: The use of a rain simulator is at the offerer's discretion.
19)  Regarding roof testing, we believe that replicates are desireable to improve reliability of results and that different treatments (eg,vegetation, soil mix, loading rates) are needed to advance the science of green roofs.  Could project funds be used to construct additional replicates and treatments?  Would it be permissible to use project funds to monitor existing green/blue roofs in addition to the plots constructed for this project?  Answer:  Use of project funds with respect to replicates, construction, and monitoring existing green/blue roofs outside the sites constructed for this project is at the offerer's discretion.
20)  Regarding "provides a pilot-scale bioretention facility for the study having a plan area of at least 9 square", a word is missing - 9 square what? Answer:  The word that is missing after "square" is "feet".
21)  The solicitation reference "Phase 2: Bioretention Cell" but just below, it references "bioretention cells" - how many cells are envisioned?  If only one, how could we "collect data on media mix and effects of vegetation types"?  Would it be permissible to use project funds to monitor existing biorention areas in addition to the one(s) constructed for this project?  Answer:  Monitoring of existing cells in addition to the one(s) constructed for this project is acceptable and the number of cells constructed is at the offerer's discretion.
22)  Is it permissible to have the "international conference" in conjunction with (or part of) another conference, such as EWRI Congress or WEFTEC?   Answer:  This question indicates that the conference would become a ?co-sponsored? conference.  If this were to be a ?co-sponsored? conference, the EPA would have to take the lead in the co-sponsoring of the conference.  However, you can bid the ?conference? portion of this requirement on a ?no cost? basis to the EPA.  And in lieu of this, the contractor would be allowed to charge ?reasonable fees? to cover the cost of the conference facility, support services, expert presentations, working meals and light refreshments (including meals and light refreshments for non-federal attendees) and similar expenses.
23)  Page 4 ? Evaluation Criteria: Paragraph A mentions that the quotation shall not exceed ten pages.  Does the page limit include all four items (i.e., Technical Approach, Qualifications of Personnel, Past Performance and Price)?  Answer:  The page limit is for your technical approach.  Your Past Performance, Cost Proposal and Resumes can be separate sections.
24)  Will the CVs for the PI and other personnel be included in the page limit?  Answer:  The page limit is for your technical approach.  Your Resumes can be a separate section.
25)  Should the cost proposal be submitted as a separate document, or is it to be included with the technical proposal?  Answer:  You Cost proposal can be submitted as a separate document.
26)  Is any particular format recommended for the proposal (e.g., SF 330)?  Answer:  There is no particular format recommended for the proposal.

NRMRL QA Requirements and Definitions
EPA?s Quality System Website:  http://www.epa.gov/quality/
EPA?s Requirements and Guidance Documents:  http://www.epa.gov/quality/qa_docs.html
In accordance with EPA Order 5360.1 A2, conformance to ANSI/ASQC E4 must be demonstrated by submitting the quality documentation described herein.  All quality documentation shall be submitted to the Government for review.  The Government will review and return the quality documentation, with comments, and indicate approval or disapproval. 
If the quality documentation is not approved, it must be revised to address all comments and shall be resubmitted to the Government for approval.  Work involving environmental data collection, generation, use, or reporting shall not commence until the Government has approved the quality documentation. 
The QAPP shall be submitted to the Government at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of any environmental data gathering or generation activity in order to allow sufficient time for review and revisions to be completed.   After the Government has approved the quality documentation, the Contractor shall also implement it as written and approved by the Government.
Definitions:
Environmental Data - These are any measurements or information that describe environmental processes, location, or conditions; ecological or health effects and consequences; or the performance of environmental technology.  For EPA, environmental data include information collected directly from measurements, produced from software and models, and compiled from other sources such as data bases or the literature.
Quality Assurance (QA) - Quality assurance is a system of management activities to ensure that a process, item, or service is of the type and quality needed by the customer.  It deals with setting policy and running an administrative system of management controls that cover planning, implementation, and review of data collection activities and the use of data in decision making.  Quality assurance is just one part of a quality system.
Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) - A QAPP is a document that describes the necessary quality assurance, quality control, and other technical activities that must be implemented to ensure that the results of the work performed will satisfy the stated performance criteria.  A QAPP documents project-specific information.
Quality Control (QC) - Quality control is a technical function that includes all the scientific precautions, such as calibrations and duplications, that are needed to acquire data of known and adequate quality.					
 Quality Management Plan (QMP) - A QMP is a document that describes an organization?s/program?s quality system in terms of the organizational structure, policy and procedures, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, documenting, and assessing all activities conducted.  A QMP documents the overall organization/program, and is primarily applicable to multi-year, multi-project efforts.  An organization?s/program?s QMP shall address all elements listed in the ?Requirements for Quality Management Plans? in Appendix B of the NRMRL QMP.
Quality System - A quality system is the means by which an organization manages its quality aspects in a systematic, organized manner and provides a framework for planning, implementing, and assessing work performed by an organization and for carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities.										R-2 - EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans (EPA/240/B-01/002) March, 2001, http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r2-final.pdf
R-5 - EPA Requirements for QA Project Plans (EPA/240/B-01/003) March, 2001 http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r5-final.pdf						Substantive Change - Substantive change is any change in an activity that may alter the quality of data being used, generated, or gathered.	
   	NRMRL?s Quality System Specifications:
(1) a description of the organization?s Quality System (QS) and information regarding how this QS is documented, communicated and implemented;						(2) an organizational chart showing the position of the QA function;
(3) delineation of the authority and responsibilities of the QA function;
(4) the background and experience of the QA personnel who will be assigned to the project; and
(5) the organization?s general approach for accomplishing the QA specifications in the SOW.											

 Category Level Designations (determines the level of QA required):
   	Category I Project - applicable to studies performed to generate data used for enforcement activities, litigation, or research project involving human subjects.  The QAPP shall address all elements listed in R-5.					
   	Category II Project - applicable to studies performed to generate data used in support of the development of environmental regulations or standards.  The QAPP shall address all elements listed in R-5.
   	Category III Project - applicable to projects involving applied research or technology evaluations.   The QAPP shall address the applicable sections of R-5, as outlined in the NRMRL QAPP requirements for the specific project type (see below).
   	Category IV Project - applicable to projects involving basic research or preliminary data gathering activities.  The QAPP shall address the applicable sections of R-5, as outlined in the NRMRL QAPP requirements for the specific project type (see below).

Guidance for QAPPs by Project Type (described in more detail on subsequent pages):
These outlines of NRMRL QAPP Requirements for various project types, from Appendix B of the NRMRL QMP (except where otherwise noted), are condensed from typically applicable sections of R-5 (EPA Requirements for QA Project Plans) and are intended to serve as a starting point when preparing a QAPP.  These lists and their format may not fit every research scenario, and QAPPs must conform to applicable sections of R-5 in a way that fully describes the research plan and appropriate QA and QC measures to ensure that the data are of adequate quality and quantity to fit their intended purpose.
   	Applied Research Project - pertains to a study performed to generate data to demonstrate the performance of accepted processes or technologies under defined conditions.  These studies are often pilot- or field-scale.  Additional guidance is given in ?QAPP Requirements for Applied Research Projects?.
   	Basic Research Project - pertains to a study performed to generate data used to evaluate unproven theories, processes, or technologies.  These studies are often bench-scale.  Additional guidance is given in ?QAPP Requirements for Basic Research Projects?.
   	Design, Construction, and/or Operation of Environmental Technology Project - pertains to engineering projects involving environmental technologies, an all inclusive term used to describe pollution control devices and systems, waste treatment processes and storage facilities, and site remediation technologies and their components that may be utilized to remove pollutants or contaminants from or prevent them from entering the environment.  Comprehensive guidance can be found in the EPA Quality System document ?Guidance on Quality Assurance for Environmental Technology Design, Construction, and Operation?     G-11, at http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g11-final-05.pdf.

G-5M, http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5m-final.pdf.   Abbreviated guidance is provided in ?QAPP Requirements for Research Model Development and Application Projects?.
   	Sampling and Analysis Project - pertains to the collection and analysis of samples with no objectives other than to provide characterization or monitoring information.  Additional guidance is given in ?QAPP Requirements for Sampling and Analysis Projects?.				   	Secondary Data Project - pertains to environmental data collected from other sources, by or for EPA, that are used for purposes other than those originally intended.  Sources may include: literature, industry surveys, compilations from computerized databases and information systems, and computerized or mathematical models of environmental processes.  Additional guidance is given in ?QAPP Requirements for Secondary Data Projects?.
   	Software Development Project - pertains to projects dealing with software development or data management and includes all types of software/hardware systems development, data base design and maintenance, and data validation and verification systems.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 334511.  The U.S. Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award firm-fixed-price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract utilizing FAR Part 13.5, with a ceiling value of $5,000,000.00 on a sole source basis under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 in order to upgrade/convert the TEAC MDR-80C/G recorders to MDR-80V recorders.  The initial task order will be executed concurrently with the master IDIQ contract. These components/recorders are to support the Apache VUIT-2 program for a total of eleven 24-ship Battalions in order to support the Global War on Terror (GWOT) in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Euduring Freedom (OEF).  In addition, the requirement will include essential repair/update/modification necessary to restore the TEAC MDR-80 Solid State Mission Data Recorders and Removable Memory Modules (RMM) to a serviceable condition but not like new cosmetically.

<DESC> REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)           EAGLE II  Small Business

Overview:
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a significant and continued need for information technology (IT) services to support the execution of its mission. DHS has met that need principally through the use of the Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE).  

The original EAGLE suite of contracts was awarded to 25 large businesses (in June 2006) and 28 small businesses (in September 2006) across five (5) functional categories with a five year base period and two (2) one (1) year options.  Under this arrangement, individual task order competition can be limited to small businesses within a selected functional category if there are two or more small businesses that can provide the required services.  For details on the current EAGLE contract, please visit the DHS open for business website at:  http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/opportunities/editorial_0700.shtm.  

As required per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), contractors are required to re-represent their size status for long-term contracts, those contracts in excess of 5 years, if a merger or acquisition occurs, or if there are contracts with novation agreements.  The purpose of the re-representation rule is to improve the accuracy of small business size status reporting.  This rule was added to all of the EAGLE contracts.  Nine (9) of the original 28 EAGLE small businesses have since been acquired by larger firms; thus, they no longer have small business status but can compete for task orders which are not set-aside for small businesses. DHS expects that a majority of the existing EAGLE small businesses will not qualify as small at the end of year 5 of the contract.   With 19 small businesses remaining in the EAGLE suite of contracts and 2  years of contract performance remaining, DHS does not plan to ramp-up (add contractors to the EAGLE suite of contracts).  Instead, the plan is to consider proceeding with EAGLE II  Small Business.

Background:
The existing EAGLE contract serves as a department-wide platform for acquiring Information Technology (IT) service solutions in five functional categories (FC's):
	FC1  Engineering Design, Development, Implementation and Integration 
	FC2  Operations and Maintenance (2 tiers; 1 without telecommunications and 1 with telecommunications) 
	FC3  Independent Test, Evaluation, Validation and Verification 
	FC4  Software Development 
	FC5  Management Support Services 
In reviewing the EAGLE task orders awarded to date, DHS has observed that FC3 has rarely been used and FC5 is best leveraged when included as part of each EAGLE task order requirement.  In addition, preliminary small business market research has indicated that the small business IT community is capable of providing services involved in categories FC1, FC2, and FC4.  Further, DHS has noted that an increasing number of small businesses are capable of providing IT services that have a substantial telecommunications element - currently FC2  Tier 2.

Strategy:
Accordingly, DHS has developed two one page charts summarizing alternative approaches (please see Attachment A  Alternative Strategy Using Small Business Category Tracks and Attachment B  Alternative Strategy Using Functional Category Tracks). Alternative 1 utilizes a small business category approach where task orders would be competed within separate pools for 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses, small businesses, and IT/Telecommunications small businesses.  Alternative 2, utilizes a functional category approach where award pools would be established using functional areas of work.  The scope of each contract would be limited to that functional category and market research would determine which small business category would be the targeted pool.  

EAGLE II  Small Business will continue to be a suite of Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity services-based contracts that will enable all DHS components to acquire IT support services to accomplish their mission objectives.  DHS believes that either of the proposed approaches provides outstanding opportunities for the small business community, while enabling DHS to benefit from a highly capable small business IT talent pool.  Additionally, both approaches support our ongoing commitment of identifying opportunities for the various federal small business programs.

Requirement:
The DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), invites interested vendors to respond to this notice by providing comments on the attached draft  EAGLE II  Small Business proposed plans for the follow-on effort for the EAGLE contract (see Attachments A and B).  It is important to note that vendor responses are solely for the purpose of requesting industry feedback and neither constitute pre-competition, nor will responses be evaluated in any way.  These draft plans should not be construed in any way as the official EAGLE II  Small Business plans, nor do they commit DHS to a particular course of action or a particular timeline.  This is a market research effort to gain insight into the capacity of the small business community to meet continuing DHS IT requirements.   

Vendors are invited to address any subject(s)/issue(s); however, the Government is particularly interested in feedback and comments in these areas: 
o	Alternative Strategy using a Small Business Category (Attachment A) or Functional Category (Attachment B);  
o	Utilization of a 2-Phase award process for EAGLE II, i.e. where phase 1 will evaluate vendors on a fairly limited basis short of full proposals such as capability statements and phase 2 would be full proposals including price for those small businesses invited to continue to phase 2;  
o	Performance-based considerations; and,
o	Industry Best Practices that might be appropriate to consider in planning and executing EAGLE II-Small Business.

All vendors interested in submitting a response should do so electronically to DHSEAGLE2@dhs.gov no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on Wednesday February 25, 2009.   This submission should not exceed 10 pages.  Efforts should be made to keep responses as BRIEF as possible, concentrating on substantive information. The Government will not pay for the cost of response submissions.  Vendors must appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information.  DHS will adhere to Federal Acquisition Regulation policy on handling proprietary information.  This is not a Request for Proposal and no contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI notice.  The Government reserves the right to post additional notices relative to the RFI and request capability statements and/or similar documentation.  Please note that no registration is required nor is a bid list maintained.

In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via the following URL https://www.FedTeDS.gov. You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitledRegister with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number and Your E-Mail Address.
