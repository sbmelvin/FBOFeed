<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV. If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov), or any other 3rd party provider, attachments may not be available or viewable to you.

THE FAA IS LOOKING FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNICAL STRATEGIES TO IMPLEMENT THE MODERNIZATION EFFORT FOR THE CIVIL AVIATION REGISTRY.  WE ARE REQUESTING RESPONSES NOT ONLY FROM COMPANIES THAT REGULARLY DO BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FROM ANY OTHER COMPANIES THAT SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MODERNIZATION WITH THE CIVIL AVIATION REGISTRY PROGRAM.

PURPOSE: This market survey Request for Information (RFI) from industry is intended to refine the FAAs operational, financial and technical strategy leading to procurement approaches in meeting the outlined Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) objectives. 

OBJECTIVE:  The FAA established the Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) to meet its congressional mandates and enhance the services provided by the Registry. The agencys objectives for this initiative will be achieved by end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.  This market survey should identify qualified and capable sources that can provide a sound solution to the modernization effort described in the documents attached to this market survey.  The responses from this market survey may shape the strategy the Government will take for the procurement of CARES.

At this time, the acquisition strategy and nature of competition has not been determined for any potential contract. The Government welcomes statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses, which can provide the required items and services. Depending on responses to this survey and analysis of market research collected, the Government may, at its discretion, decide to pursue a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement.  Additionally, there may be one or multiple awards to accomplish this effort. 

Interested vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov.  This process can take a few months so vendors who respond to this market survey are advised to start the process.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR OFFERS. A Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Proposal (RFP) may be made under a separate announcement in the future. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing vendor responses to this market survey. Therefore, any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $27.5 million.

The purpose of this announcement is to conduct a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors, in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1. This market survey will enable the FAA to review responses that are current and will assist with acquisition planning based on current data. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. The Government may also decide to convene an Industry Day and/or conduct targeted conversations with respondents to garner additional information pursuant to the RFI responses submitted.

HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS MARKET SURVEY: Interested vendors should submit the items listed in the CARES RFI - QUESTIONS attachment to this Market Survey.  Your submission should be formulated based upon the information provided in the CARES OVERVIEW attachment.

Responses to this market survey must be received by 5:00 P.M. CST, January 31, 2019. Please include CARES MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE: (Insert Company Name) in the subject line of your e-mail. Information provided will not be released but please mark PROPRIETARY on all documents submitted as necessary.

Electronic submissions should be in either Microsoft Word or Portable Document Format (PDF), as applicable. Also, please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10 MB, hence, if necessary, responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail to be received.  Electronic submission files should utilize the following naming convention: 

CARES_MS-Response_(insert your company name).pdf (or doc)

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING VIA E-MAIL TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER. CONTACT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BELOW.

<CONTACT>Aumiller, Wesley M.
<DESC>The Department of Energy/Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) intends to negotiate on a single source basis with RMEL, formerly the Rocky Mountain Electrical League under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), soliciting from a Single Source, for an annual membership to RMEL. WAPA has been a member of RMEL over the past decade. Dedicated to fostering a thriving community of electric energy professionals, RMELs 300 corporate members share ideas, techniques and programs to better serve the industry and its customers. The association is only focused on education for utility personnel. RMEL membership also provides access to a diverse community of utilities and service companies. RMELs community is comprised of companies and individuals that are leaders of the industry.

RMEL provides resources and 30 annual events to benefit members of the utility industry. Content is designed to help attendees and members feel productive and knowledgeable as they get back to work armed with practical takeaways. Continuing education credits are given at each event, and members can even bring an RMEL event to their location. Events are focused on topics like plant management, public policy, the Smart Grid, power supply planning and projects, finance, system operations, generation, growth, OSHA, renewable technologies, safety, transmission, reliability, overhead and underground distribution, workforce issues, keeping rates low, giving back to the community, NERC/FERC, transmission line design, IT, grounding, arc flash, sustainability, customer service, green building, substation design, distribution line design, health, energy efficiency, security, management, customer service, government regulations, engineering and many other top concerns for the electric energy industry.

The Government intends to acquire membership access using the provisions, clauses, and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.

Based on market research and the need, WAPA has not identified any other association that can provide electrical utility based information to meet the needs of the agency. RMEL membership is an important WAPA mission requirement given the access to subject matter experts, peers, current industry information, and events it provides. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 813920, and the size standard is $15M. The base period of performance is for one year, with four (4) one (1) year option periods, beginning January 1, 2019.

This notice of intent is not a competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation package will be publically issued. In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received from all responsible sources will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

If WAPA identifies no other capable sources by December 28, 2018, WAPA will issue a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about January 1, 2019 to RMEL. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.

Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to Wes Aumiller at aumiller@wapa.gov by close of business December 28, 2018. Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice No telephone requests will be honored.

A key component of the NextSTEP Partnership model is to provide an opportunity for NASA and Industry to collaborate in developing capabilities that meet NASA's space exploration objectives while also supporting industry's commercialization plans. The NextSTEP-2 BAA contract vehicle requires corporate resource contributions for R&amp;D-type activities, including maturing unique technologies.</div>
<div><br />This BAA Appendix addresses the development of human lunar landing capabilities. NASA is planning three demonstration missions to the lunar surface, with the first crewed human lunar landing targeted for the third mission.</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />This NextSTEP-2 Appendix E will include a NASA reference human lander architecture configuration. The full architecture will include a Descent Element, Ascent Element, Transfer Vehicle, Refueling Element, and Surface Suit. NASA plans to launch the first demonstration mission in 2024. The minimum objective of this mission is to demonstrate a lunar surface landing with one or more Descent Elements capable of supporting a future human lander that includes both Descent Element and Ascent Element. Contracts awarded under Appendix E may have multiple phases. The first will be for brief studies to mature requirements, tailor applicable standards, procure long-lead parts and implement technology maturation plans for early risk reduction. Following the study, NASA intends to execute future phases that may result in multiple awards, for the Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) and flight demonstrations of Descent Elements. NASA is still considering acquisition options for other human lunar lander system Elements. The detailed study requirements and additional information on the overall acquisition strategy will be contained in the forthcoming Appendix E solicitation.</div>
<div><br />NASA will use the information gained through these initial studies to inform the performance requirements for the human lander system and will work with industry to continue to mature the approach for future missions.</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />The Point of Contact for technical and programmatic questions on this synopsis is Dr. Greg Chavers, NASA HQ Advanced Exploration Systems Division at <strong>HQ-NextSTEP-BAA@mail.nasa.gov</strong>.</div>
<div><br />Submission information, participant eligibility, additional topic information and specific evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be identified in Appendix E when it is released.<br /><br /></div>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. 

FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs, such as this, to the acquisition of basic and applied research and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.
This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center, through the DoD Lock Program, is soliciting pre-proposals for efforts related to the need topic listed below. If invited, offerors will be asked to submit a full proposal.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF PANEL CROSS SECTION THROUGH NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

Background:
The DoD Lock Program funded a project to develop, design, and test a full-scale prototype panel both numerically and in the field. Through this project, a panel cross section was developed and fabricated. From the fabrication process it was realized that the panel could be optimized due to the cost of fabrication and materials, overall weight and the performance of the panel.
  

Research Need:
The DoD Lock Program is looking for academic and independent groups that have already developed and calibrated numerical models of panel cross sections to optimize the existing panel cross section. Please note that we are not interested in funding validation and calibration of numerical models for the panel cross section, we are focused on optimization of an existing panel cross section. In addition, we are looking for groups that have developed, validated, and calibrated numerical models of energetic tools. As part of this process the investigation into new types of polymers for use within the cross section can be included. The DoD Lock Program requests that a pre-proposal be submitted outlining the expected costs associated with development of numerical models for a polymer material, optimization of a panel cross section through validated and calibrated numerical models, and final panel specifications for structural and fabrication drawings.
Specific instructions and data requests will be provided at a later date if selected for further consideration. 
 
SUBMISSION PROCESS: 
The pre-proposal submittal process is an email-based submission.  Pre-proposals should be submitted via email to: NAVFAC_CI8_BAA_Submissions@navy.mil. There is no specific format required for the pre-proposal, however, the pre-proposal should be consolidated into one single file and should not exceed 5 pages in length. All pre-proposal submissions must be received before the deadline.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 
To be considered for funding in FY 2019, pre-proposals must be received no later than 11:59 pm, Pacific Standard Time on January 28, 2018. Offerors will receive a confirmation email message within one business day acknowledging successful submission.
It is the responsibility of the offeror to confirm receipt of the submission. If invited to submit a full proposal, these will be due 30 days after notification. 

EVALUATION PROCESS: 
Following an evaluation and selection process, successful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email inviting submission of a full proposal. Unsuccessful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email with a brief description of the reasons for preproposal rejection. Awards to non-government entities (academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, industry) will be in the form of contracts. The nominal duration of this work is expected to be several months of work spread over the course of 1-2 years. Applicants are strongly encouraged to use realism of cost for the proposed effort as their metric, as this will be a critical element in the review process.
Otherwise, meritorious pre-proposals and full proposals will be rejected if cost does not accurately reflect the proposed scope of work. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
The pre-proposals and full proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria, of approximately equal weight. 

1.	TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives in terms of meeting the stated need topic, as well as evidence that the science/technology is mature enough for applied research funding, and the performance criteria to measure success of the research effort. 
2.	OFFERORS EXPERIENCE: For the pre-proposal phase, the offeror should clearly provide evidence showing experience related to the solution being proposed.
The organizations capabilities related to experience, techniques, or a unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence. 
3.	PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS AND KEY MEMBERS RELATED EXPERIENCE: For the pre-proposal phase, the offeror should provide the name, highest degree earned, organization/affiliation, location, and years of experience for the Principal Investigator and key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the pre-proposal as such. If invited to submit a full proposal, the offeror will need to submit Curriculum Vitae for the Principal Investigator and key personnel.

4.	COST/PRICE: The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. For the pre-proposal phase this information may be limited to a total cost estimate by calendar year (Jan 1  December 31). Assume for Year 1 of your project that effort will begin in approximately March 2019. If invited to submit a full proposal, additional guidance on cost/price information will be provided. 
5.	PROJECT BENEFITS: Expected benefits of the proposed work, key issues the proposed solution addresses, potential application of the results, and advantages over current approaches. 
6.	PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION: Describe the intended product(s) and all associated deliverables, the requirements for implementing the proposed products of this effort, and the potential technical risks that may pose a challenge to successful implementation.

7.	All offerors are required to be U.S. Citizens and U.S. owned companies. Contractors shall be able to view, store and handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

NOTES: 
1.	An eligible pre-proposal or full proposal does not guarantee a contract. Multiple contracts may result. 

2.	An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM). No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Registration is not required for proposal submission, but must be completed prior to initiation of award negotiation. To avoid delays in the award process, applicants are encouraged to initiate SAM registration early in the submission and review process.
Non-government awardees will also need to provide a DUNS (Dunn  and  Bradstreet) number (http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.doc) and CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code (http://govwin.com/knowledge/ccr-registration) before an award can be made. 

3.	The preceding data should be sufficient for completing a pre-proposal.
 
4.	There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA. Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA must follow the instructions to submit a pre-proposal. 

5.	There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the contractor before a contract award.


6.	As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified pre-proposals with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific projects. Technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207. The cognizant Program Manager and other scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204.
However, pre-proposal and full proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractors employee having access to technical and cost pre-proposals and full proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any pre-proposal or full proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of their institutional NDA with their proposal. However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4). Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors who have submitted a pre-proposal, after the Review Committee reviewed all pre-proposals submitted by the solicitation cut-off date.


7.	For questions regarding this BAA, contact NAVFAC EXWC at (805) 982-1567 or (805) 982-1225 or via this email address: NAVFAC_CI8_BAA_Submissions@navy.mil. Correspondents are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business proprietary, or competition-sensitive information via email. Offerors will receive an automated email message acknowledging successful submission. If the contractor does not receive a notification of pre-proposal receipt, the contractor should call or e-mail NEXWC by using the phone number or e-mail address provided in this section. 

8.	Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to DFARS 226.3.
All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC.

DFARS 235.017-1 allows DOD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply.
Naval laboratories and Warfare Centers as well as other DOD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit proposals in response to this BAA. If any such organization is interested in one or more of these program areas, they should contact the NEXWC program office to discuss its interest. As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest.


9.	Do not call the Contracting Office for verification. The pre-proposal is not received by the Contracting Office.

<DESC><strong>FA3002-19-R-A0001 <br />AirCraft Maintenance Enterprise Solution (ACES)</strong>
<p><strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI)<br /><br />OVERVIEW:</strong> The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron (SCONS) is seeking information from industry service providers capable of providing Aircraft Maintenance and Support Services as a prime contractor for an enterprise-wide Air Force (AF) aircraft maintenance services contract. Current customers include, but are not limited to the following: Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB) in Columbus, Mississippi; Vance AFB in Enid, OK; Sheppard AFB in Wichita Falls, TX; and the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Executive Airlift Mission at Joint Base Andrews, in Prince George's County, MD. This Enterprise contract will accept additional aircraft maintenance customers from any Major Command (MAJCOM) at any AF location within the Contiguous United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii throughout the period of performance (PoP); therefore, additional aircraft maintenance scope may be available in the future. This RFI is issued for informational and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The Government is considering a strategic sourcing/enterprise contract vehicle to support aircraft maintenance and flight line-related services for the AF. Specifically, the Government is pursuing an award of a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) with Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity task orders. The PoP will have a 10 year ordering period and up to an additional 5 years for performance after the last order is placed for a total possible period performance of 15 years. The anticipated periods of performance on individual task orders would range from three to five years, with task order performance occurring at one or more bases/units.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) initiated amyloid PET imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) in 2005 and tau PET imaging with AV-1451 (T-807) in 2016. Consistent with autopsy data from BLSA and other studies, approximately 30% of cognitively normal individuals have detectable amyloid deposition in the brain on PET-PiB imaging. Individuals with higher levels of &beta;-amyloid are older, more likely to carry the Apolipoprotein E &epsilon;4 allele, have greater longitudinal decline in memory and other cognitive functions, and are more likely to accumulate amyloid over time. In addition, through the BLSA autopsy program, NIA has shown the correspondence between in vivo imaging and post-mortem values of amyloid burden (13,18). Work by our group has been central to defining the relationship between amyloid burden and memory change (17,23), to characterizing the magnitude and spatial pattern of progression of amyloid burden (2,4,7,11,16), to highlighting the importance of individuals with intermediate amyloid levels that would be considered PiB negative in many binary classification schemes (7,16), and to identifying modifiers of amyloid burden (3,7,9,10,12,20,21). The NIA has also developed an approach for estimating age at onset of amyloid accumulation, providing an individualized index that can be used as a dependent outcome to assess factors that may modify age at onset of amyloid accumulation (4). This approach was applied to demonstrate that Apolipoprotein E &epsilon;4 genotype is associated with earlier age of onset of amyloid accumulation in the BLSA sample.</p>
<p>The BLSA was initiated in 1958 and is a multi-disciplinary study of physiologic and psychologic aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women. Since 1994, the NIA has been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, to investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, to identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging. More recently, the NIA has been collecting in vivo measures of brain amyloid and tau, the hallmark pathologies of AD, using PET scanning.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is for a better understanding of "age-related" changes also requires definition of the various neuropathologies that accumulate in conjunction with advancing age. NIA collects detailed neuroimaing, as well as cognitive measures in BLSA study participants. NIA acquires measures of regional brain volume (MPRAGE) and vascular lesion burden (T2, FLAIR), white matter integrity (DTI), and functional networks (resting state functional MRI). In a limited number of BLSA participants, NIA also acquire measures of amyloid and tau through PET molecular imaging. The longitudinal assessment of these different modalities will provide insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of both diseases and age-related cognitive changes. In particular, this information will answer the question of whether accumulating neuropathologies fully account for age-related cognitive change or if there is some degree of age-related cognitive decline that is intrinsic to the aging process, i.e. "normal aging."</p>
<p>Specifically, the purpose is to acquire services to perform and quantify in vivo brain scans, including amyloid and tau neuropathology and regional cerebral blood flow, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in the BLSA. Studies of changes in amyloid deposition will be conducted using PET and 11C- Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) and studies of changes in tau pathology will be conducted using PET and 18F-T807 from Avid Pharmaceuticals (Lilly).</p>
<p>The following are two goals to satisfy NIA's objective fully:</p>
<p>1. Investigate changes in brain function and amyloid and tau burden as early biomarkers of cognitive decline and impairment including Alzheimer's disease.<br />2. Identify possible protective factors which prevent or delay the onset of cognitive <br />impairment in individuals who maintain normal cognition despite substantial amyloid and <br />tau burden.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>NIA will provide structural MRI scans and the Contractor shall perform PET 11C- PiB, and 18F-AV1451 scans and assist in sophisticated quantitative analysis of imaging data, using kinetic modeling techniques. Structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging brain scans necessary for any image analysis will be acquired by the NIA at the NIA 3T MRI facility and will be provided to the Contractor for image processing and analysis. A minimum of 90 scans and a maximum of 120 scans in the Base year of performance, and a minimum of 120 scans and a maximum of 150 scans for the following four (4) options years is anticipated.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform and assist in quantification of in vivo brain scans, including amyloid and tau neuropathology and regional cerebral blood flow, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET).<br />&bull; Assist with scheduling the PET scan studies.<br />&bull; Assistance with preparation and review of regulatory documents, including materials to meet Institutional Review Board, FDA, and radiation safety regulatory requirements.<br />&bull; Provide Radioisotope administration.<br />&bull; Provide Medical monitoring of participants during PET scan procedures. <br />&bull; Provide parking coupon and lunch to research participants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 6.0pt; text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>Building Resilient and Inclusive Communities in Conflict (BRICC)</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Syria is in the midst of a nearly decade long, multi-faceted conflict that has led to more than 500,000 killed, the flight of over 5.5 million refugees, and the internal displacement of another 5.9 million. In addition to trauma, violence, and displacement, Syrians face a myriad of socioeconomic impacts of war, including: failing public services; damaged and destroyed infrastructure; weakened governance institutions; severe economic decline; and substantial gaps in education and workforce development.&nbsp; This leaves individual communities and their respective governance structures coping with a variety of challenges including: limited access to electricity and water; damaged infrastructure; inadequate education and health systems; diminished ability to collect and treat public waste; rising costs and decreasing quality of fuel; decreased economic activity; and increased demands for basic government services. These challenges are most acutely experienced by women, traditionally disadvantaged groups, internally displaced persons, returnees, and young people, many of whom lack adequate representation to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are met. Furthermore, the conflict has resulted in dramatic demographic shifts between men and women as well as traditionally disadvantaged groups which is changing societal roles for these populations. This constellation of challenges requires interventions that are creatively designed across sectors that strengthen community resilience and stability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Implementation of activities in this environment requires a high degree of coordination and communication among implementing partners, the USG, coalition partners, other donors and Syrian stakeholders. The dynamic environment involving active conflict, shifting lines of control, and multiplicity of actors has a direct impact on access to specific geographic locations, Syrian organizations, and individuals. There are also significant logistical requirements that demand close coordination with USAID and Syrian partners.&nbsp; For example, the Offeror will need to be adept at remote management of the activity as its personnel will face difficulty traveling in Syria.&nbsp; BRICC will require innovation, creativity, and triangulation of information in the oversight of implementation and monitoring efforts.&nbsp; These challenges pose risks to: the design and implementation of individual activities within communities, the timely delivery of material and technical assistance, and the verification and monitoring of activities within Syria. Mitigation of these risks requires an approach that leverages extensive and detailed analysis of the environment and all groups on the ground, strong relationships with relevant Syrian organizations and individuals, and the diplomatic resources of USAID and other USG and international actors.<br /> <br /> <strong></strong></p>
<h1 style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">SERVICES AND TASKS REQUIRED</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Jordan is seeking partners to implement the &lsquo;Building Resilient and Inclusive Communities in Conflict (BRICC)<em>&rsquo; </em>activity in Syria through a multiple holder Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract. Based on results of market survey conducted, USAID will determine a numerical range of set aside IDIQ contracts for U.S. Small Business and unrestricted IDIQ contracts awarded.&nbsp; The final number of awards and source selection decision will be determined by the Source Selection Official.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">Third-party monitoring for the activities contemplated under BRICC will be procured separately.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">BRICC will foster resilience and stability in conflict-affected communities across Syria to prevent the re-emergence of extremist groups such as ISIS, counter the influence of malign actors, empower communities to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and pave the way for safe, dignified, voluntary return of internally displaced persons and refugees.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> BRICC will apply an integrated, coordinated, multi-sectoral, conflict-sensitive, and systems-based technical approach. BRICC will work with stakeholders across four Intermediate Results (IRs):</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;">(1) Essential services restored and accessible (including water (irrigation and drinking), energy, health, education, and livelihoods);<br /> <br /> (2) Inclusive, participatory, accountable and transparent governance strengthened (empowering authorities, institutions, organizations, and citizens with the skills, tools, and experience to effectively, transparently, and equitably provide public services, respond to citizen needs, and meaningfully engage their constituencies on issues of importance to the community as a whole<span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;">)</span>; <br /> <br /> (3) Livelihoods restored and economies revived (market-based interventions that are inclusive, scalable and pro-poor as a means of income generation and improving economic security for both households and communities); and <br /> <br /> (4) Access to education and vocational training expanded (expanding equitable access, improving quality, expanding and strengthening vocational and non-formal education). <br /> <br /> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_2et92p0"></a><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Specifically, BRICC will apply the following principles to achieve all intermediate results:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_tyjcwt"></a><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Moreover, as part of systems-based logic, Offerors must propose specific means to coordinate BRICC efforts with external influencers outside of the direct management of the BRICC activity in order to, for example, avoid duplication or conflict with other donors&rsquo; activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><a name="_bx5es0nvirlt"></a>&nbsp;<strong><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><a name="_m7yb52rntij8"></a><strong><em><span style="color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Conflict-Sensitive: </span></em></strong>BRICC will be <strong>conflict-sensitive</strong> in the design, implementation, sustainability, and monitoring of interventions by ensuring that activities contribute to forging connections, resolving conflicts, and changing perceived differences, as well as ensuring that activities absolutely do not exacerbate tensions, drive violence, or empower armed groups.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><a name="_qwjveemx2z00"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong><em>Community Ownership: </em></strong>BRICC&rsquo;s holistic approach requires that activities be designed, implemented, and evaluated in close collaboration with communities themselves - building on local knowledge, strengthening existing systems, and incorporating community feedback on a continuous basis to improve effectiveness and accountability. USAID recognizes the four IRs that are the focus of BRICC are not the only elements necessary for supporting communities to move from fragility to resilience. For this reason, it will be important for BRICC to collaborate closely with other actors covering different needs in Syria to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong><em><span style="color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>

Offers should go beyond avoiding duplication to ultimately use coordination to leverage greater results with other actors on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Innovation and Creative thinking:</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><a name="_17dp8vu"></a><strong>Creativity:<em> </em></strong>Offerors may propose any number of means to achieve the RO and IRs, including technical assistance, in-kind support, direct financial support, engineering expertise, capacity building, embedded advisors, local partners, or other means to the overall objective of stability and resilience. Each type of assistance should work to increase the ability of civilian authorities, civil society, and the private sector to work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">Offers should engage with non-traditional partners and techniques to apply leading research and technology to reach intended results rapidly and effectively. Subject to USAID&rsquo;s approval, a variety of contracting, grant and other mechanisms may be utilized by Offerors. <strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong>Fostering Innovation:</strong><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"> Building resilience in active and post conflict environments necessitates creativity and a certain level of risk taking in order to maximize impact, scalability, and improve the overall cost-effectiveness of interventions. BRICC offerors should adopt design thinking and a systems-based approach to foster innovation; test and pilot new tools, approaches and technology; and, accelerate and apply innovative solutions as a part of all activity design, implementation and learning. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong>Managing for Innovation: </strong>Restrictions on travel inside Syria by expatriate staff will require creative, methods and technology to verify activity milestones, monitor progress and successfully manage overall operations. Offerors are encouraged to propose management structures that help institutionalize innovation and an integrated, systems-based approach to reach the intended IR&rsquo;s and RO.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong><em>Sustainability for Self-Reliance: </em></strong>Building self-reliance will be a key aspect of activity design, implementation, and impact.&nbsp; BRICC will promote self-reliance and sustainability through provision of technical assistance and capacity building support to partner organizations and institutions along all lines of effort.&nbsp; BRICC will require close engagement with local partners and full handover of the management of essential services and any activities designed to continue beyond the end of the activity.&nbsp; Processes for building the capacity of local organizations will be integrated into the activity design and additional opportunities to strengthen local institutions and organizations will be explored as they arise.&nbsp; Examples include support to local technical bodies to develop cost-recovery mechanisms for public services, capital-recovery models for livelihoods interventions, and targeted technical assistance in financial, administrative, and organizational management.&nbsp; BRICC will work with local governance entities, civil society organizations, and local businesses to build ownership of results and help communities sustain themselves for the long-term.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BRICC will build upon the lessons learned from previous U.S. and international interventions implemented in conflict-affected communities within Syria. It will use an integrated approach, and leverage the experience and learning accumulated over six years of successful resilience programming in the country.&nbsp; It will seek to restore stability to communities, reduce their dependence on humanitarian assistance, and build a foundation for self-reliance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition, the activity will support equitable stewardship and administration of essential public services and assist Syria in rebuilding its service infrastructure with a focus on including women, youth, and other disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">USAID will closely coordinate all BRICC interventions with other USG-funded stabilization programs in Syria to ensure synergy and avoid redundancies.&nbsp; In Syria, BRICC will coordinate with the Syria Recovery Trust Fund (SRTF) and the Department of Defense, as well as the SRTF headquarters in Amman, Jordan.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;">BRICC will also coordinate with the State Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs (NEA) which manages activities from Turkey. And finally, where appropriate and with USAID&rsquo;s written approval, BRICC will coordinate with USAID&rsquo;s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Affairs (DCHA), USAID&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), and other humanitarian partners based in Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq.&nbsp; BRICC will also be expected to coordinate with non-USG implementers and to be an active participant in existing coordination mechanisms in both Turkey and Jordan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Syria is in the midst of a nearly decade long, multi-faceted conflict that has led to more than 500,000 killed, the flight of over 5.5 million refugees, and the internal displacement of another 5.9 million people. &nbsp;In addition to trauma, violence and displacement, Syrians face the socioeconomic impact of war, including: severe economic decline, damaged or destroyed infrastructure, failing public services, weakened governance institutions, and substantial gaps in education. &nbsp;Individual communities and their respective governance institutions cope with a variety of challenges including: limited access to electricity and water, damaged transportation infrastructure, inadequate educational and health facilities, diminished ability to collect and treat public waste, rising costs and decreasing quality of fuel, lack of educational opportunities, decreased economic activity, and increased demands for basic government services. These challenges are most acutely experienced by women, ethnic minorities and children, who don&rsquo;t have adequate representation to ensure their voices are heard and their needs met.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Implementation of activities contemplated in ART in this environment requires a high degree of coordination and communication among implementing partners, the U.S. Government (USG), and sub-partners. The dynamic environment involving active conflict, shifting lines of control, and multiplicity of actors has a direct impact on access to specific geographic locations, Syrian organizations, and individuals. There are also significant logistical requirements that demand close coordination with USAID and Syrian partners. &nbsp;For example, the contractor will need to be adept at remote management of the activity, as its personnel may face difficulty traveling in Syria.&nbsp; The provision of Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">(MEL) and Research, Analysis, Data Visualization and Mapping (R&amp;A) services, and the implementation of related activities, will require innovation, creativity, and triangulation of information in the oversight of implementation and monitoring efforts.&nbsp; These challenges pose risks to: the design and implementation of individual activities within communities, the timely delivery of material and technical assistance, and the verification and monitoring of activities within Syria. &nbsp;Mitigation of these risks requires an approach that leverages extensive and detailed ongoing analysis of the environment; strong relationships with Syrian organizations, institutions, and individuals; and the political and diplomatic resources of USAID and other USG and international actors.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 4.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Jordan is seeking a partner to implement the &lsquo;Accountability and Research Team (ART<em>)&rsquo; </em>activity in Syria. The aim of ART is to provide third party monitoring (TPM); monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL), as well as research, analysis, data visualization and mapping (R&amp;A) services for USAID&rsquo;s Middle East Bureau (MEB) programs implemented in Syria.&nbsp; The first of the MEB-administered Syria programs is the proposed Building Resilient Inclusive Communities in Conflict (BRICC) award that will be procured through a multi-holder, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

The requirement includes multiple needs for relocation services issued under one or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for a term of One Year to include Four (4) Option years with an overall potential value of $2M. It is the intent of the Government to award a contract to four or more contractors under this solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After award of initial IDIQ, individual task orders may be competed among the selected firms unless the Government deems otherwise for a specific task order.</p>

It is required that the potential IDIQ(s) holders will provide quick access to moving services with the expectation that additional fees will not be applied due to the size and location of services required (i.e. A requirement for relocation services at an office in Delaware with an estimate value of $20k vs. a requirement for the Philadelphia Office with an estimate value of $20k.).</p>

<RESPDATE>011119
<ARCHDATE>01262019
<CONTACT>Evans, Stewart
<DESC>CATHOLOUMMINESCENCE (CL) INSTRUMENT AND SPECTROPHOTOMETER: This sources sought notice is for informational purposes only and shall not be considered a solicitation, obligation, or commitment by the Government.  This notice is for market research to determine the availability of any businesses with capabilities to provide an optical microscope cathodoluminescence (CL) stage equipped with two accessories: (1) an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and (2) a spectrophotometer matching the Salient Characteristics listed below. 

GENERAL Description and Salient Characteristics.

The stage and the spectrometer will be added to an existing petrographic microscope to allow USGS to observe mineral luminescence when minerals are impacted by an electron beam. The spectrophotometer accessory collects photons and displays spectra of CL intensity versus wavelength. These spectra can be interpreted to understand the basis for CL color. 

The associated X-ray spectrometer allows for the identity of the chemical makeup of the minerals that are luminescencing. The desired microscope must be capable of identifying zircon in-situ that can be analyzed by the Sensitive High-Resolution Ion MicroProbe  Reverse Geometry (SHRIMP-RG) located at Stanford University, CA.  Other applications are summarized on this Web page: https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/semcl.html
 The stage and spectrometer must be designed to work with a petrographic microscope, such as the Nikon Optiphot Pol.
 The sample material to be analyzed are standard polished thin sections. The viewing area of the stage must be large enough to study an entire polished thin section (typically 27 by 46 mm). 
 A cold cathode source must be the source of the electrons used for imaging. The cold cathode source eliminates the need for coating the sample material with conductive material.
 The CL stage must be compatible with the working distances of the microscope objectives on the USGS microscope  20 mm for the 5x objective and 9 mm for the 10x objective.
 The CL stage have a controller that regulates beam current and voltage. controlled by separate electronic unit.
 The CL stage must include a vacuum pump and controllers that works with the stage.
 The CL stage must accommodate addition of an energy dispersive X-Ray spectrometer (EDS) that will fit on standard camera mounts used on petrographic microscopes.
 The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer must have a beryllium window that is less than 1 mil thick, a, high resolution detector, control system, and a multichannel analyzer, 
 The spectrophotometer accessory must include a monochromator, the detector photomultiplier tube (PMT), and signal processor (software to acquire and process the data). The spectrophotometer should be optimized for working with spectral emissions in the ultraviolet to visual range (approximately 190 to 900 nanometers).

The purpose of this notice is to determine interest and capability of potential sources.  The NAICS is 333314, Laboratory Analytical Optical Manufacturing, 500 Employees.

Interested parties will submit an email detailing their capabilities and experience with these supplies and services.  Sufficient information must be provided to demonstrate the ability to complete the supplies and services.

This is not a request for quotation or an announcement of a solicitation.  Responses will be used for market research only. 

Responses are due no later than 01/11/2019 1300 EDT. Response must be submitted to Stewart Evans by email at sevans@usgs.gov. Responses shall only be accepted through electronic mail addressed to sevans@usgs.gov. All response documents required by this sources sought must be uploaded and received in their entirety no later than 01/11/2019.  Responses submitted by hardcopy or the FedConnect web portal or Fed Connect Message Center shall not be accepted or considered.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>Endodontic Kit</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, NOR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PERSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>SUBJECT: The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) is conducting market research for a supplier to configure a Deployable Endodontic System. Any vendor questions regarding this RFI are requested by 5:00 pm EST on 20 December 2018 to allow sufficient time for USAMMA to respond. Vendor responses to this RFI are due by 5:00 pm EST on 17 January 2019.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information provided in response to this RFI will be considered and treated as unrestricted information which can be used by the Government in any future planning or acquisitions. USAMMA does not anticipate awarding or modifying a contract in response to this RFI. All information comments and suggestions determined to be beneficial to USAMMA may be incorporated into future acquisition documents or contracts, without identifying the source or obtaining prior approval from the source. The Government shall not be responsible or liable for any costs incurred by any party in the preparation and submission of any response to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Information provided in response to this RFI will not be returned. USAMMA does not guarantee that any resultant acquisition action will result from this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: General Dentist trained in the last decade represent the bulk of the Army Dental Corp. The vast majority of these dentist have been trained to complete root canal therapy almost exclusively using rotary instrumentation. This is a departure from the way endodontics was taught a 15-20 years ago. New technology allows for rotary endodontic capability to be packaged in a light and easily transportable package. It is now possible to provide deployed dentist with a compact endodontic kit that possesses a high level of capability. Today, in the combat theatre, the Army Dental Corps has the capability to save soldiers teeth in a forward environment, where traumatic dental injuries and the need for endodontic care is common. Without the proper equipment, the current option for deployed dentists is to extract easily repairable teeth. Not only is this not optimal patient care, but adds significant post deployment cost upon returning home with the expense of prosthodontic rehabilitation. Providing deployed dentist with a compact endodontic system will enhance their theatre capabilities and allow them to provide significantly improved endodontic treatment using minimal amount of equipment and material, and reducing the overall dental care cost per soldiers.</p>
<p>This RFI is an invitation to submit to USAMMA the following: Technical information and all related supporting documentation for a deployable endodontic system and associated components and accessories.</p>
<p>Please provide detailed responses submitted on the Vendor Response excel spreadsheet (attached). Responses must be straightforward, clear, concise, and specific to the information requested.

The CPARS database information is uploaded to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.

Each contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed the thresholds outlined in FAR Part 42.15 is required to provide to the contracting officer contact information for the contractor s representative with their response to the solicitation. The contractor is responsible to notify the contracting officer of any change to the contractor s representative during the contract performance period. Contractor s representative contact information consists of a name and email address.

The Government will register the contract within thirty days after contract award. For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete. For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the contractor s performance annually. Intermediate reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed. Each report shall be forwarded in CPARS to the contractor s designated representative for comment. The contractor s representative will have thirty days to submit any comments and return the report to the VA contracting officer. Failure by the contractor to respond within those thirty days will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in PPIRS without contractor s comments.

Health and Human Services/Office of Inspector General (HHS/OIG).  To ensure that the individuals providing services under the contract have not engaged in fraud or abuse regarding Sections 1128 and 1128A of the Social Security Act regarding federal health care programs, the contractor is required to check the HHS/OIG, List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the OIG Website (www.hhs.gov/oig) for each person providing services under this contract.  Further the Contractor is required to certify in its proposal that all persons listed in the contractor s proposal have been compared against the OIG list and are NOT listed.  During the performance of this contract the Contractor is prohibited from using any individual or business listed on the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance.  Contractor must adhere to the provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health Information (PHI).  As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In accordance with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VA.  Optical Dispensing Services qualifies as a medical service   therefore, no BAA is required.

This requirement is in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers as implemented in Subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and Subpart 836.6 of the VA Acquisition Regulation. All submissions will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria. A "short list" of the three most highly rated after initial source selection will be chosen for negotiations of a contract award. The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract because of this announcement. Respondents are put on notice that firm(s) selected by the Selection Authority will be required to submit a Fixed Price Rate Proposal to include labor, overhead, profit, and other costs for this project for negotiation by the Contracting Officer prior to contract award. The negotiated agreement will be incorporated into the resulting contract.

PROJECT INFORMATION:

This project will replace old and beyond end of life cycle air handling units (AHUs) in the  Uptown facility. AHU numbers 6, 110A, 105, 404, 401, 111, 108, 2, 4 and 105 are all in varying degrees of disrepair or undersized and need to be replace. The most egregious ones have condensate pans that are rusting through and are not easily serviceable. The lines feeding these units must be modified to ensure future maintenance can be achieved without shutting off service to other areas of the facility. Existing fire dampers are not serviceable to three units. Finally, all pneumatic controls shall be replaced with DDC (Bac-Net) and tied into both building management center and the operations plant. The project will address FCA issues and will make required energy and sustainability upgrades.

<DESC>Special Notice: OLI Software Renewal for NETL

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to issue a modification to existing purchase order number 89243319PFE000133 with OLI Systems, Inc. that adds NETLs annual renewal of OLI Flowsheet: ESP plus OLI Studio: Corrosion and Stream Analyzer software programs, and aligns all performance period dates through March 31, 2020.  This requirement is considered a sole source to OLI Systems because, to the best of the NETLs knowledge based on market research conducted, OLI Systems is the author and sole owner of OLI software (including OLI Flowsheet: ESP plus OLI Studio: Corrosion and Stream Analyzer and Silver Service); and the confirmed sole authorized distributor and seller of OLI Software.  NETL utilizes various software programs for model building and has determined that the OLI Studio software is the only program that meets the requirement needs of NETLs determining environmental speciation of corrosion media at elevated temperature/pressure values, developments of thermodynamic diagrams for alloy stability in corrosion media, and corrosion rate predictions.  NETLs Research & Innovation Center (RIC) will use this product to provide rigorous predications of the chemical reactions and phase behaviors of complex mixtures of chemicals in water, under modest to extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, and ionic strength. OLI Flowsheet: ESP plus OLI Studio: Corrosion and Stream Analyzer is the only known software that can perform these functions, while providing corrosion rates, oilfield scale prediction, water treatment and environmental simulation.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement needs.  This special notice is not a request for quote/proposal; however, is solely for the purpose of identifying the additionally open market software renewal items that are being procured under this requirement.

<CONTACT>DeLawder, Sarah
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Contracting and General Services in Falls Church, VA intends to award to James Gale, Snellville, GA 30078, to provide an international instructor for the FWS International Training Program (FITP).  Special considerations exist in the field of wildlife trafficking and leadership training, where FWS/OLE personnel conduct international wildlife trafficking and leadership training.  There are three specific courses that FWS/OLE utilizes to provide this information, the Wildlife Trafficking Investigator Program (WTIP), the International Conservation Chiefs Academy (ICCA), and the ICCA Alumni Training Event (IATE).  Twice each year the International Conservation Chiefs Academy (ICCA) will bring together 40 leaders of conservation law enforcement agencies from foreign countries in an effort to build leadership and collaborative capacity between international conservation law enforcement agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, in partnership with others provide the instruction and facilitate the training. The ICCA is the largest and most expensive wildlife conservation law enforcement training event internationally. This high profile event calls for executive leadership by experienced former senior managers to maintain the prestige of the training event. Former Acting Deputy Assistant Director of OLE, James Gale, has participated as an incident commander for the ICCA and a member of the ICCA Steering Group leading to its inception and management. The ICCA is designed to support the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking.  Beginning in 2019, alumni training events will be conducted at specified regions of world that will encompass approximately 30 graduates from ICCAs. These training events will continue on the success from the ICCA to build on collaborative capacity building and adaptive leadership to combat transnational wildlife crimes. 

The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Portland Area Office, Yakama Service Unit (YSU) intends to extend the contract completion date for existing contract HHSI248201800171G with RPH Temp Services for locum pharmacists.
<p>The new contract completion date of 4/30/2019 is necessary to allow for continued uninterrupted coverage in the Pharmacy department in support of direct patient care. Performance has been deemed satisfactory with the existing services provided by the contractor; removing services now would be a hindrance to the Indian Health Service mission of providing quality care to American Indians and Alaska Natives.</p>
<p>This original contract was placed against Federal Strategic Sourcing (FSS) contract number: V797P-7312A. Requesting quotes from other contractor/vendors when we have an existing contract would provide no demonstrable value &amp; would cause unacceptable delay in the delivery of direct patient care.</p>

<DESC>USPFO of Louisiana intends to award a sole source procurement to HDT Expeditionary Systems, 30500 Aurora Rd Ste 100 Solon, OH 44139. The award is for Airbeam tent accessories in support of the 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team JRTC rotation at FT. Polk, LA in FY19. This procurement is being made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) 1 and FAR Part 6.302-1, for other than full and open competition; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 624221 and the small business size standard. The government has completed extensive market research and found that only one company can accommodate the requirements of the 256th IBCT. A sole source award has been determined to be the best and most effective option considering a substantial duplication of costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. All potential qualified sources must respond not later than 18 December 1200 CST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be emailed to 2LT Andrew Montgomery at andrew.j.montgomery.mil.mil@mail.mil at 318-290-5878 and MAJ David Bourgeois david.l.bourgeois4.mil@mail.mil at 318-290-5933.

<SOLNBR>140P1219Q0016
<ARCHDATE>01142019
<CONTACT>Rogers-Bailey, Shawna
<DESC>This special notice informs the public that The National Park Service Intermountain Region intends to award a non-competitive firm-fixed price contract for RELM Wireless Hand-Held BK KNG-P150, KNG2-P150 Radios, and accessories.  The award will be made directly to RELM Wireless BK Technologies utilizing the Department of the Interior FieldCom multiple award IDIQ. A signed Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file; the contents are provided herein.

1. Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):

Intermountain Region Telecommunication shop is responsible to perform maintenance, repair and programming of all park radios. As such a substantial commitment to the RELM Wireless products has occurred over the last few years by various park units supported by IMR Telecommunication Shop.  In keeping with the procurement of a brand that the IMR Telecommunication Shop is already setup to maintain where no additional technical training will be required to support the RELM brand of radios is the most cost effective.  Intermountain Region topology is an incredibly vast and complex canyon system which makes VHF radio communications on the ground incredibly difficult; the KNG portable radios have the ability to transmit at 6 watts out over both digital and analog transmissions without having to change channels which is instrumental to achieving communications in this area.   
 The National Park Service (NPS) also requires the ability to `clone or program portable or mobile radios from another radio during incident response scenarios. During incident response, all available radio assets can be called into service. The primary incident response requiring cloning occurs during emergencies and non-emergency incidents. During incident response scenarios, time and resources are limited which require radios to be programmed outside of normal technical facilities, generally in a remote location. Additionally, qualified technical personnel may not be available to program a non-clone able radio.
Due to Wildland fire suppression needs, NPS requires cloning compatibility with the radio cache maintained by the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) based in Boise, ID. State and local agencies that cooperate with NPS incident response generally maintain programming/cloning interoperability with the NIFC fire cache as well. 
Radio programming methods and data are unique to a given suppliers product line. At present it is not possible to clone radios between multiple manufacturers. Therefore, the NPS requires the product of a single manufacturer. 
It is of the Parks best interest to continue toward developing and maintaining a standard of the same or similar model of equipment across all radios in the park, which will result in lower maintenance costs over time (fewer duplicate parts for different models of radios to be kept in stock), reduced costs over time to purchase duplicate accessories for multiple models of radios (and so more staff can share accessories), and radio operational safety will be increased because more users will be using the same make/model of radio, simplifying training and allowing more staff to be familiar with how to use the same radio.
Each different brand requires additional learning and can reduce our ability for timely responses to our users.  Hand held radios are a critical component to employee safety and communication with field personnel, single programming code plugs ensure full interoperability.  
By having only one troubleshooting process, we can streamline our support and provide our users with a quicker turnaround in the event of equipment failure.
Also creating radio programming images (code plugs) that contain the required configurations for channel configuration and repeater control, this standard expedites the setup of new equipment.  The use of images significantly reduces the setup time because we do not have to configure each device and security settings each time.
Each brand has unique programming software and setup that are particular to that brand.  By staying with one brand NPS reduces the number of images that are needed to be created, tested, and maintained.
It is anticipated that this Delivery Order will be approximately $75,709.62.
Only one vendor, BK Technologies RELM Wireless can sell and original product.

3. Market Research. Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: 

Searches using Google, Department of Homeland Security FieldCom contract, Department of Interior FieldCom contract, and GSA Advantage.  A Special Notice for this action will be posted at FBO, and any information received in response will be taken under consideration by NPS. Local knowledge of the vendor pool indicates this is the only viable service.

This contractor provides a subscription database for On-Line Residential Market Data Trends for Rents and Occupancy in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Metropolitan Markets.
<p>The contractor is to provide access to this database for up to Six (6) users.</p>
<p>I. Housing Market Analysis Data<br />All rent comparability, submarket and metropolitan market report for 165 primary, secondary and tertiary metropolitan multifamily markets, including quarterly executive- level summary data, rankings and analyses on U.S. and regional markets, as well as a variety of special research studies. For the 50 primary metropolitan markets, this data includes:</p>
<p>A. Details on supply, demand, vacancies, rents, and related market indicators on metropolitan markets for the multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Submarket-level detail for multifamily, office and retail markets are included. Annual and quarterly trends are presented, along with five-year forecasts. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.<br />B. <br />C. Metropolitan market and submarket details on supply, demand, rents and vacancies for Class A and B/C properties for the multifamily and office sectors. Annual and quarterly trends are presented. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) formats<br />.<br />D. Aggregate and property-specific rent comp group reports including rents and vacancies, in addition to five-year historical trends for aggregate rent comp groups for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.<br />E. Individual property sales, including transaction and property characteristics for multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Updated weekly<br />.<br />F. Economic and real estate analysis in narrative form on most metropolitan areas. The reports discuss key multifamily, office, retail and industrial supply and demand trends in each metropolitan market, pinpoint under-performing and outperforming submarkets. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format.</p>
<p>G. Current market indicators across all submarkets in each metropolitan market, including rents, vacancies, free rent concessions, and expenses for multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) format.</p>
<p>H. Building-level listings and summary statistics for submarkets and metropolitan markets are presented of planned/proposed, projects under construction and recently completed for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly.</p>
<p>I. Daily real estate and economic stories are posted from the leading local newspapers and periodicals across the nation, initially coded into relevant metropolitan markets and topic categories (e.g. multifamily construction). A searchable 90-day archive is maintained. Updated daily. Available in an HTML format.</p>
<p>II. Data Files<br />EXCEL data files with supply demand and rent time series data (from 1980 in most<br />markets) for the Primary Markets and selected market aggregations are extractable for all database variables for the 30 secondary metropolitan markets data and reports provided in the following: <br />(a), but without the forecasts;<br />(c), but without the historical trends; and<br />(g) and (h) are available.<br />For the 85-tertiary metropolitan markets the information provided is the same as for the secondary markets, with less submarket details and historical data is limited to the past 3-4 years.</p>
<p>III. Sales Comp Module<br />A database of apartment transactions valued at $2 million or more in all 80 primary and secondary markets and for 85 tertiary markets.</p>
<p>IV. Transaction Analytics Module<br />This is a database that includes sales transaction activity. It provides mean, median and 12-month-rolling cap rates, sales price data by price per unit or square foot, and total transaction volume. Transaction trends are available by quarter back to 2005 for metropolitan areas, regions, and the U.S. This module also provides data on top deals, with buyer and seller information, and on key submarket transaction activity. HUD will use this information to identify sales and capital market trends in the multifamily real estate market and assess troubled debt.</p>
<p>V. Single Property Valuation Tool<br />Allows the user to enter their assumptions or observations on current building performance, select a variety of forecast options based on observations and predictions at the submarket and metro levels, and select some final assumptions in terms of terminal cap rates, additional income and other variable affecting property value. The end result is three distinct market values based on the DCF, Sales Comp and Direct Cap methodologies.</p>
<p>VI. Expanding Markets<br />Currently FHA has access to 200 apartment markets throughout the United States. With this acquisition HUD will have access to an additional 75 markets.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 2/2/2019 - 2/1/2024. The NAICS code is 519130 and the size standard is 1,000 employees. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations.

If no responses are received, HUD will proceed with the sole source award to Costar Realty Information, Inc. The anticipated award date of this requirement is around December 21, 2018.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
