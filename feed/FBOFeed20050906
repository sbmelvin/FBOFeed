<DESC>The NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) has released a notification of intent to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) concerning its plan to hire a contractor(s) to provide Norfolk, Virginia-based contractor support to the Joint Education and Training (JET) Subdivision for development of a NATO Network Enabled Capability (NNEC) Education program.

This program will be funded by the NATO Military Budget Committee for an estimated cost of 300,000 EUR ($375,000 USD) with the potential to be renewed for an additional three years. The bidding procedure will be one envelope, funded under the ACT Budget (257.2005.711311.SA.31Q.000.Q09.000.000.200). Partial bidding is not authorized.

The classification of this contact is NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

The reference for this project is ACT-SACT-05-78 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-ACT-SACT-05-78.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Senior Training Developer/Analyst to support the Information Superiority and NATO Network Enabled Capability Integrated Capabilities Team (IS-NNEC ICT). This individual will develop a truly NATO oriented education program for NNEC. He will commence by conducting a thorough education needs assessment. This analysis phase (Environment, Training Needs, Target Audiences, Learning Skills, Education Strategies, Prerequisites, Evaluation of existing national courses, etc.) will carry through the base period and then continue with design and development (Courses oriented to NATO needs, Delivery, Evaluation and Maintenance) into the option years.

NNEC is one of the concepts sustaining all the Transformation Objective Areas. Allied nations have widely varying capabilities and very different levels of understanding and ambitions as to what NNEC means or what it can do for them. It is imperative that we get all nations to the same level of understanding of the NNEC concept and that we facilitate a common level of ambition. We need nations to sign up to the concept and be aware that it is more about new ways of working and collaboration than just new technologies. NNEC Education is the key enabler.

Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation and possess at least a valid NATO SECRET level security clearance, have at least one bachelor-level degree from a recognized degree-granting institution, and have a minimum three years experience in a related field.

<DESC>The Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcast and Recorded Sound Division has a mandate to preserve and maintain access to its audio collection materials. Items in the Library’s audio collections require preservation playback reformatting on highly sophisticated archival equipment while being simultaneously monitored by an acoustically trained audio engineer in a highly discriminating audio environment.  Each format has unique challenges and technical issues requiring high volume level monitoring to insure the absence of all audio aberrations in the playback signal path.   Due to the unique design of the NAVCC preservation suites and the custom designed speaker enclosures; the Library of Congress intends to purchase through a sole source from the manufacturer Crown, for Reference Amplifiers that are thought to be the only models acceptable which meet: (1) the Library's technical needs and (2) satisfy the Library’s time critical and preservation needs for providing access, digitization and preservation of audio program materials.  Without this audio amplifier, audio cannot be accessed, digitized nor preserved in the Lab.  This need is amplified by the scheduled relocation of the Recording Lab to the NAVCC in Culpeper, Virginia.  Technical Specifications are as follows: 

REFERENCE 1: Power output: 800 watts into 8 ohms, 1,190 watts into 4 ohms (per channel, stereo mode); 2,375 watts into 8 ohms (bridge-mono mode).  Input connections: Balanced 1/4" phone jacks on chassis and female XLR connectors on standard PIP module. Output connections: A pair of color-coded dual binding posts for each channel. Dimensions: 19" W x 7" H x 16" D (4 rack spaces). Net weight: 60.69 lbs.  

REFERENCE 2: Power output: 360 watts into 8 ohms, 565 watts into 4 ohms (per channel, stereo mode); 1,145 watts into 8 ohms (bridge-mono mode). Input connections: Balanced 1/4" phone jacks on chassis and female XLR connectors on standard PIP module. Output connections: A pair of color-coded dual binding posts for each channel. Dimensions: 19" W x 7" H x 16" D (4 rack spaces). Net weight: 56.13 lbs.  

Any other company/manufacturer that feels it is capable of and believes its Reference Amplifiers can meet all the above equipment performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.   Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government must receive all such statements by close of business 12PM EST, Thursday, September 15, 2005 to be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed Order (Contract) based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received from interested firms/manufacturers responding to this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services for the conduct of focus groups in African-American and Mexican-American mothers and their daughters with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1439.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The age at onset of puberty is significantly earlier in African-American than in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white girls in the United States, based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The secular trend in obesity in children is a leading factor potentially influencing the decline in age at onset of puberty, while other factors such as polymorphic variants of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the steroid hormone cascade have been associated with an earlier age at onset of breast development in African-American girls. 

The overall purpose of this procurement is to conduct focus groups in African-American and Mexican-American mothers and their daughters aged 7-10 years to identify ethnic-group differences in and cultural sensitivity to the following:  1) clinical staging of puberty in girls; 2) factors influencing cooperation and perceived benefits of pubertal assessment in girls; 3) cultural views of overweight and obesity in girls and in women; and 4) acceptance of self-assessments of pubertal development in girls.  Each focus group will have 8-10 individuals, with separate focus groups of mothers and of their daughters for each ethnic group.

MD Anderson and its’ staff is the only source known to the NCI that have maintained demographic and anthropometric as well as reproductive history of the women in the original cohort  of the initial study.  They have successfully maintained follow-up of the Mexican-American cohort girls and can identify girls and their by age and by body fat.  The members of the Mexican American Cohort Study have been loyal participants with a high response rate, and this consistently high response rate assures the high mother-daughter response rate to the focus group effort and subsequent puberty study.

(HRI)/Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), Buffalo, NY 14263, services regarding: Compiling and Evaluating Tobacco Surveillance Measures.  

In order to reduce tobacco use and the subsequent morbidity and mortality caused by its use, scientists need to identify core measures in domains traditionally identified by epidemiologists as agent, host, vector, and environment. The agent (the agent or organism that causes disease) is the tobacco product.  The host is the smoker or chewer/dipper or potential smoker, chewer, or dipper.  The vector (the organism that distributes the agent) is the tobacco product manufacturer, marketing, and retail system.  All three of these domains influence each other and are influenced by familial, social, economic, historical, political, legislative, and media factors.  

The contractor shall: 1) establish standard definitions (including coding schemes) for use of these measures and common protocols for data collection and data entry into ToBIG, 2) identify source(s) of measure and, 3) develop a report that describes the above raw material to be used for a ToBIG workspace/portal/interactive web-based tool.

Health Research, Inc. and its’staff have extensive and unique expertise related to tobacco control surveillance. This knowledge is critical to the continued support of this research project.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current study in progress.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13.106 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-05-00399 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  The NAICS and  small business size standard for this project are 541620/$6.0 million.  Only one award will result from this solicitation, via the issuance of a time-and-materials purchase order.  Statement of Work: Draft Guidance New Home Indoor Air Quality Specifications.  This Statement of Work outlines tasks  for the identification and assemblage of technical information that will assist the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the development of an indoor air quality (IAQ) labeling program for new homes.  Specifically, the Contractor shall gather technical information regarding construction  methods and materials that will meet the IAQ specifications for new homes developed by the Agency.  The Contractor shall survey and assemble existing home construction technical texts, technical guidance documents of various professional organizations supporting the home construction industry,  building code supportive materials and existing housing-related construction training materials, to include energy efficiency, civil engineering, air quality and general construction methods developed by Federal and state agencies, universities, and private organizations.  The Contractor will  assemble the appropriate technical guidance for home builders that will address each of the technical specifications as outlined in EPA's proposed "ENERGY STAR with Indoor Air Package" initiative.  The specifications can be found at http://www.energystar.gov/homes; then, under "quick links", click  on "Technical Resources", "Indoor Air Specifications". ESTIMATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The estimated period of performance for this requirement is from the date of award through January 20, 2006.  BACKGROUND:  The Indoor Environments Division of the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, and ENERGY  STAR for New Homes of the Office of Atmospheric Programs are jointly developing a voluntary labeling program for newly constructed homes.  The proposed new program will offer home builders that meet specific indoor air quality (IAQ) specifications for new home construction the opportunity to obtain  an IAQ label comparable to the existing ENERGY STAR label for new homes.  EPA recognizes that many of the causes of diminished air quality in homes can be avoided by construction methods that specifically address these issues.  Also, construction methods and materials that address energy efficiency  and indoor air quality are often interrelated.  The label's specifications are designed to:  help avoid moisture and mold problems; resist the entry of soil gasses into the foundation; assist in pest management; address combustion-safety issues; provide improved filtration of the home's air and  reduce the potential for entry of contaminants, provide adequate ventilation with fresh outside air, and assist homeowners in maintaining their home's air quality.  While these criteria reduce the potential for moisture and pollutant problems in the home, they also provide the added benefits of  improved durability of the home's structure, and improved comfort of the occupants.  Builders adopting these specifications will be able to offer an improved product to the home buyer and also may avoid buyer complaints that often relate to moisture and comfort issues. OBJECTIVES:  This Statement  of Work has five objectives: 1) Develop a draft guidance document that will provide home builders practical technical information to assist them in implementing EPA's IAQ specifications for new homes. 2) Guidance will be based upon learning elements, that will be developed first, from the existing  IAQ specifications.  3) Guidance will specifically address each specification (or related group of specifications), describing construction methods or materials necessary to meet the specification.  Because of the myriad products in the marketplace, not every product/method can be described.   Therefore, guidance will consist of at least one example that illustrates the principle/objective of the individual specification.  Guidance will also address the differing methods necessary because of climate differences.  4) The guidance will provide illustrations derived from existing technical  guidance materials.  Guidance will also provide references to related internet web sites where builders may access additional technical guidance.  5) The guidance will be user-friendly, providing clear technical guidance using terminology commonly directed to professionals in the home construction  industry.  TASKS:  Task 1: Project Plan and Conference Calls  The Contractor shall provide the EPA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a project plan and a schedule of activities within two weeks (14) days of receipt of contract.  During the course of the contract, the contractor will  make bi-weekly conference calls to the COR to report progress and to refine product development. Task 2: Develop Project Plan Together with the COR, develop a list of learning elements, derived from the individual IAQ specifications (attached version will be an update of that found at the  aforementioned web address), that home builders should understand to be able to implement the specifications. To undertake this task, the contractor shall provide the services of a residential building science national expert.  Along with the COR, establish a schedule for developing the various  sections (and addressing specific learning elements) of the draft guidance document.  Provide the COR a proposed list of informational sources that will be utilized in developing the guidance document.  The list should include technical guidance and/or training materials from, but not limited to:   industry trade associations and others representing the various aspects of the construction industry, building scientists, Federal and state agencies, manufacturers, and construction training entities.  No new guidance/training materials will be developed under this contract. Task 3: Information  Collection & Analysis Based upon the learning elements developed in Task 2 and also consistent with the approved Research Plan in Task 2, the Contractor will:  Identify and collect technical information that describes/illustrates how to accomplish the elements of the specifications.  The contractor  will draw from existing materials and expertise appropriately tailored for home-building professionals.  All information shall include a complete citation of the source of the information (including document name, author's name, volume, edition, page numbers, etc.) as they apply to each source  material; Provide the services of a residential building science national expert and meet with the COR to discuss the relative merits of available information and agree on format for the presentation of materials; Secure permission for use of materials from authors when necessary; Identify any  existing code citations or trade/industry/association standard practices that apply to the IAQ specifications requirements, but that were not included in the current draft specifications as "References"; Provide all training and guidance materials in Microsoft Word, and Adobe Acrobat pdf  or jpg  file formats; Identify informational gaps that exist because of the lack of guidance/training information relating to various specifications/learning elements, and determine potential actions and costs to fill these gaps. Task 4: Draft Guidance Document The contractor will assemble the materials  into a draft guidance document in a format that follows the structure of the IAQ specifications.  The complete citations, described in Task 3, shall also be included for the information contained in the document.  The draft document shall be reviewed and approved by the national expert noted in  Task 3 before the contractor submits it to EPA for final approval. Task 5:  Final Report The contractor shall develop a final report that summarizes the process that was followed in completing the project, the informational sources utilized, and the rationale for the selected structure for the  draft guidance document.  It shall also include a summary of the informational gaps that exist and a projected approach for filling specific gaps and estimated costs for generating the information.  DELIVERABLES (3 hardcopies and 1 electronic of each deliverable to the COR) 1) Within 14 days of  receipt of contract, a project plan and a schedule of activities for the successful completion of the contract (Task 1). 2) Lists of proposed learning elements, detailed work schedule, and recommended informational sources (Task 2). 3) Hard copy versions of all guidance and training materials and  also Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat pdf or jpg file formats of each (Task 3) 4) Drafts of specific sections of the guidance and training materials according to the approved schedule of Task 2. 5) Draft guidance document, organized in the sequence of issues occurring in the IAQ specifications, and  containing all the compiled training materials, including citations  	(Task 4). 6) Final written report at the completion of the project (Task 5).

All proposal shall be addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Attn: Elinor Cunningham, RFQ No. ADM-05-399, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.  RFQ No.  ADM-05-399 herein is issued as a RFQ. This RFQ is 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 532112. The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipt of $18.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under the North American Industry Classification System.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals. The NRC intends to issue a Commercial Item, Firm-Fixed Price contract for a one (1) year period of performance with three (3) one-year option periods.  NOTE: THE ATTACHMENTS (Statement of Work and Minimum Specifications for Vehicles) ARE ATTACHED.  Offeror shall submit firm-fixed prices for each period of performance inclusive of the option years. OBJECTIVE:   The contractor shall lease to NRC up to three (3) new, full-size, six passenger (Class IV) sedans and one (1) sport utility vehicle, (hereafter referred to as vehicles) on an annual basis for an estimated of four years (an initial base year with three additional one-year optional periods). REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall lease to the Government, up to four (4) vehicles at a firm fixed price.   All vehicles provided by the Contractor during the period of performance of this contract, or any extension, shall have the minimum specifications listed in the attachments. There are three option periods under this contract as follows: (1)  The Government shall have the option to lease up to four vehicles, for a first one-year period, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth of this contract. Should the Government elect to exercise it’s option for the first year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the base year of the contract. (2) The Government shall have the option to lease up to four  vehicles, for a second one-year period, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth of this contract.   Should the Government elect to exercise it’s option for the third year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the previous year of the contract.  (3) The Government shall have the option to lease up to four vehicles, for a third one-year period, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth of this contract. Should the Government elect to exercise it’s option for the third year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the previous year of the contract. (4) The Government shall have the option to exchange to another type of vehicle with at least 30-days notification to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall have the vehicles available for pickup by the NRC at the Contractor’s facility in any location within the Metropolitan Washington, DC area.  The vehicles shall be available for the Government’s pickup on the delivery schedule date as set forth in Clause No. 52.212-2 under this contract, which at such time, the term of the initial base year (1st-year) lease shall begin. The vehicles will be garaged at NRC’s headquarters, located at the One White Flint North Building, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland.  NRC is exempt under 41 CFR 101-38.204, from the requirement to display official U.S. Government license tags and other identification.  The Contractor shall therefore furnish all required tags from the State Of Maryland for the vehicles prior to the Government’s pickup of the vehicles. The Government will install telephones and reading lamps in each of the leased vehicles and will remove this equipment from the vehicles upon expiration of the contract.   WARRANTY: The manufacturer’s standard warranty for the leased vehicles shall cover the entire period under this contract or any extension.  Any towing that may be required for warranty service shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. MAINTENANCE: The Contractor shall perform all routine maintenance on the leased vehicles in accordance with the maintenance schedule recommended by the manufacturer (i.e. oil and oil filter changes, lubrication, tire rotation, fluid replenishment, etc.).  RETURN OF VEHICLES:  At least 30-days prior to the expiration or termination of this contract, the Government will contact the Contractor to determine a destination within the Washington Metropolitan area mutually agreeable to both parties for the return of the vehicles.  The Government will return the vehicles to the Contractor at the mutually agreed delivery destination, not later than five work days after expiration or termination of the contract period for the vehicles.  The Contractor shall be responsible for performing an appraisal of the physical condition of each vehicle returned by the Government, prior to that vehicle being released from the Government’s custody, and shall furnish the Government with a copy of the appraisal upon it’s completion.  The Government shall not be responsible for any damage not listed on the appraisal report. The Government will assume full responsibility for reconditioning the vehicles at it’s expense, excluding normal wear and tear as defined below .  For purposes of this contract lease, “normal wear and tear” is defined as those dents, dings, paint chips, scratches, pitted but not cracked windshields, and interior wear such as soiled carpets and seats, normally occurring to a motor vehicle over the contract period of use, in both a rural and metropolitan area.  In any event, the Government’s liability for any reconditioning of the vehicles shall be limited to replacement of glass and exterior trim, and repair to body damage attributable to collision only, and to interior damage such as cut, torn, burnt materials, as well as mechanical repair.  Contractors are cautioned that the Government, by signing the damage estimate, does not acknowledge liability therefore.  This can only be accomplished by an authorized NRC Contracting Officer after evaluation and consideration of all factors.  SUPPLIES OR SERVICES: The Government estimates that each vehicle will be driven approximately 5,000 miles per year and does not anticipate use of the vehicle in excess of this mileage.   State the expected lead time of the vehicles in your proposals.   It is estimated the initial one-year for the vehicles would begin on November 10, 2005. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this Request of Quotation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the Request for Quotation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Past Performance; (2) Technical specifications; and (3) Price.  Technical and past performance, when combined are more important than price. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  PAST PERFORMANCE: The Offeror shall demonstrate successful past performance in performing work that is similar in size and scope to this procurement.  The Offeror shall submit all contracts performed during the past five years similar size and scope to this procurement. This shall be done by describing current and past work of a similar or identical nature in such a manner that an evaluation can be made of the performance history and the relevance of this experience to the requirements of the solicitation.  It is incumbent upon the Offeror to provide information which is accurate and current as the NRC will attempt to contact some of the references to verify the information provided.  The Offeror shall provide the information requested using the format specified below.  Each contract reference shall be limited to one page in length: 
(a) Contract or Purchase Order Number; (b) Name and Address of Government Agency; ©) Point of Contact;(d)Contracting Officer; 
(e)Current Telephone Number and Facsimile Number;(f)Technical Representatives; (g) Estimated value of Purchase Order/Contract Award;(h) Period of Performance of the Contract or Purchase Order (including extensions);(i)Outline how the contracted effort is similar or identical in nature to the NRC’s requirement, with a brief technical description sufficient to permit ready assessment of the described project’s relevancy to the NRC’s requirement.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Hossam Aly El Cheikh, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry, 2 Latin America St., Garden City, Cairo, Egypt, Phone: (202) 792-1201, Fax: (202) 792-1198
Egypt Cold Chain System Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to complete a Feasibility Study of a cold chain system and refrigerated facilities at Luxor Airport in Southern Egypt.  

The World Bank released a report in 2001 entitled “Arab Republic of Egypt: Toward Agricultural Competitiveness in the 21st Century.”  The report states that the greatest barrier to agricultural exports in Egypt is the failure to deliver the quality of products required by export markets because of the lack of cold storage facilities and a cold chain system in Southern Egypt.  Currently, high value agricultural products are exported to Europe, and the Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE), but because of the hot climate in Southern Egypt (average 75 Fº in winter and 110 Fº in summer) and the lack of cold storage facilities and distribution links, most of the products are unsuitable for export.  Most products are exported by airfreight and the lack of airport cold storage facilities jeopardizes their quality.  

Egypt’s economic growth is imperative for poverty reduction.  Tackling unemployment by providing jobs for Egypt’s growing working age population is equally vital-not only for growth, but also for social stability.  Current official estimates place unemployment at 10 percent (although it is widely believed to be higher), and labor-force growth at around 3 percent annually, or about 550,000 new entrants per year.  Egypt will need to achieve a sustained real GDP growth rate of at least 7 percent annually for unemployment to decline to more manageable levels.  To achieve and sustain these levels of economic growth, the country needs to spur more domestic savings and investment, and increase efficiency and competition.  It is essential for the country to improve export performance and rely less on external resources that are vulnerable to shocks, especially tourism.  

In today’s market of high quality agricultural commodities, buyers demand/require that the Cold Chain be maintained for perishable commodities from harvest to the end-buyer/receiver.  Because of the lack of a Cold Chain System in Southern Egypt and cold storage facilities at Luxor Airport, regionally produced agricultural commodities lose the competitive edge of quality and price, which impedes current national policies on poverty reduction and export improvement programs for Southern Egypt.  The establishment of the Cold Chain System will provide significant benefits to the region such as: 
·	Achieving promising export potential and improving direct exports from Southern Egypt.
·	Providing significant economic development to the region.
·	Maximizing the regional agricultural capabilities through quality improvement. 
·	Assisting the national poverty alleviation programs to achieve its goals.

The vital components of the Project include the construction of a centralized grower packing and shipping facility that provides the necessary grading, packaging, pre-cooling and cold storage facilities, refrigerated transport, and cold storage facilities at Luxor Airport.  The airport is a key transportation facility for the export of Egypt’s high value crops in the south.  Luxor is located on the Nile River in Southern Egypt.  It is a very short distance from the airport to the seaports on the Red Sea.  A cold storage facility at Luxor Airport would provide refrigerated transportation options, which could enable access to the Red Sea Ports for exports to the Arab Gulf States.  Sea transport across the Red Sea can be as short as a few hours, and is only 15% of the cost of air transport.   

The Egyptian Government recently completed a 7-year land reclamation project entitled “The Toshka Valley Project” in Southern Egypt, which made it possible for Egyptians to reclaim thousands of acres of previously underutilized land to grow high quality agriculture commodities.  However, the project revealed that the lack of a Cold Chain System and cold storage facilities at Luxor Airport prevents high value agricultural commodities that have great potential for the export market from meeting international market specifications.  Establishing the Cold Chain System in Southern Egypt is a key priority of the Government of Egypt in order to improve the current economic potential of the reclaimed lands to encourage the growth of high demand agricultural products, and assist in export development programs, which will have a positive impact on poverty reduction programs in the region.  

The Feasibility Study will consist of the following tasks: 1) Technical Analysis; 2) Economic Analysis; 3) Financial Analysis; 4) Environmental Analysis; 5) Regulatory Issues; 6) Proposed Goods and Services Implementation; 7) Implementation Plan; 8) Host Country Development Impact Analysis; 9) Final Report, with a design and tender document to execute the project. And estimated budgetary figure to execute the project.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $390,000 grant to the Grantee from U.S. Trade and Development Agency.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with President and Fellows of Harvard College, 718 Hunting Avenue, Boston, MA 02115-5924 to identify existing quality of care measures that can be evaluated by the National Quality Forum’s (NQF) membership councils and voted as voluntary consensus standard for cancer care quality measurement.  The Cancer Care Quality Measurement Project (Canqual) is an interagency initiative to develop quality of care measures for cancer care that can be used in research, quality improvement, program policy, and surveillance. The NQF has developed a national steering committee and expert technical panels to guide the review of measures according to scientific criteria established by the NQF for these measures.  One of the areas that the committees and panels are currently working on is colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment.  The contractor shall use simulation modeling for outcomes of interest to the cancer community, such as clinical or service delivery processes that conceptually produce those outcomes.  It will focus primarily on the clinical processes around effectiveness of care.  Harvard will be modifying previously developed simulation models to provide estimates of the contribution of four processes – or nodes – to improve cancer outcomes and will identify those nodes where there is a potential for net positive impact on survival or mortality.  The nodes shall be ranked by degree of impact and improvement potential (i.e., the difference between current practice and optimal practice).  It will be based on current practice analyses of SEER and SEER-Medicare linked data and optimal practice will be based on reasonable estimates of maximal diffusion of care.  Dr. Karen Kuntz  at Harvard College and her colleges are uniquely qualified to perform the work outlined in this contract.  They have developed a model with features that are well suited for this project, namely a treatment-based post-diagnosis model that already captures the clinical processes determined to be relevant by Canqual.  This cohort model has already been calibrated to match SEER relative survival and incorporates economic cost data.  This is the only known source to the NCI researcher that has developed a treatment-based model that contains details of recurrence, resection, and surveillance.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.     All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 2:30PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 15, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI-5117 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-05).  National Institutes of Health is developing vaccines for Influenza, HIV, Ebola and other viral diseases.  Making different mutations of viral proteins is critical in the vaccine development.  After making different mutations of viral proteins, those vaccines candidates will be tested in animal model.  By using different animal models, different vaccine candidates will be evaluated for their immunogenicities against the viral proteins.  Having various reliable and accurate assays to measure the B cell and T cell response in animals after immunization is an essential part to this process.  Specific monoclonal antibodies to different type of mouse immune cells’ marker and cytokines have been used to develop different immune assays to measure the different immune responses.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure from BD Biosciences Immunocytometry the following items:  Custom PE Conjugate 0.1-5mg Mouse CD3 - Quantity of 5, UOM: mg; Custom PERCP Conjugate 5.1-10mg, Mouse CD4 - Quantity of 6, UOM: mg; Custom APC Conjugate 10.1-99.9 UOM: mg; Mouse CD8A - Quantity of 12, UOM: mg; Custom FITC Conjugate 10.1--99.9mg, Mouse IFN Gamma – Quantity of 15, UOM: mg; Custom FITC Conjugate 5.1-10MG, Mouse TNF – Quantity of 7.6, UOM: mg; Custom Purified NALE 0.1-5mg, Mouse CD28 – Quantity of 5, UOM: mg; Custom Purified NALE 0.1-5MG, Mouse CD49D – Quantity of 5, UOM: mg; Custom Purified 10.1-99.9MG, Mouse CD16/CD32 – Quantity of 18.75, UOM: mg;  Shipping and Handling costs.  This is in support of Project#: 1 Z01 AI005003-01, Title: Development of Influenza Vaccine.  Our researchers have been using the specific monoclonal antibodies from BD Biosciences Immunocytometry for years.  Their high quality products do not only provide us the essential element of the valuable intracellular flow assay, but more importantly, they can provide us the same consistent high quality specific monoclonal antibodies.  Such consistency is essential for analysis data between different experiments at different time, and this intrinsic consistency cannot be replaced by another companies’ products easily.  The contractor will produce the monoclonal antibodies that we special require.  The contractor will conjugate the special required monoclonal antibodies with specific format: Purified, FITC, PE, APC or PerCP as required.  The contractor will analysis the products with detail QC document to show the products function.  The contractor will put them in the specific concentrations as we required.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to MicroCal, LLC, 22 Industrial Drive East, Northampton, MA 01060.
The current research projects require the following instrument specifications that are met only by MicroCal – VPITC and no other instrument in the market.

Sensitivity:  Must have the capability to detect heat pulses as low as 30 nanocalories.
Stability:  Measured baseline noise level (RMS average) must be less than 0.5 nanocalories per second.
Internal Peltier Device: Must contain a thermoelectric heating and cooling that can provide rapid and precise temperature changes between experiments.
User Selectable Response Times: Must have multiple, user selectable response times which will allow optimization of analyses for slow and fast reactions.
Sample Cell: The sample cell must not be made of gold.  Gold is known to react with some buffer components.  Such reactivity will cause increased noise thus lowering the performance of the instrument. 
 
NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifth (5th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Fred.Ettehadieh@fda.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Purpose
The Forest Service, an agency within the Department of Agriculture, seeks contractor services to provide management and technical support service for their e-Gov and Enterprise Architecture (EA) Programs.  The resulting contract will provide the Forest Service with a vehicle for fast and effective access to acquire state-of-the-art enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service e-Gov EA initiatives.  This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract with provisions for Firm Fixed Price and Time and Material pricing arrangements under individual task orders. 

Background
As an agency of the United States Federal Government, the Forest Service understands the e-Government transformation objective as “the use of digital technologies to transform government operations in order to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and service delivery.” The Federal vision for electronic government is “an order of magnitude improvement in the federal government’s value to the citizen; with decisions in minutes or hours, not weeks or months.” The progress made within the Forest Service’s e-Gov EA endeavor will have a direct correlation to how well the agency transitions to delivering information and services in electronic form over the Internet. Succeeding in this effort will require a detailed understanding of the value chains that now support the agency’s information and service delivery, as well as the ability to modify these value chains to achieve the desired results, where necessary.
The Forest Service is comprised of more than 35,000 permanent employees and over 100,000 seasonal and volunteer employees making it the largest agency within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). As part of this larger enterprise and mission, the Forest Service EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations must fit within the USDA and federal level EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations.
For each initiative area, the Forest Service e-Gov roadmap describes the dimensions of business needs, or opportunities, along with the e-Gov “foundation” technologies that can be employed to meet these needs or capitalize on opportunities. There are 14 foundation technologies identified in the roadmap, many of which the USDA and the Forest Service does not yet own or license. Each Forest Service e-Gov initiative area can benefit from employing an average of nine of the foundation technologies, and each such technology has been identified as having promise to support e-Gov transformation for an average of 12 to 13 initiative areas. These statistics represent, as does the balance of the Forest Service e-Gov Strategy and Roadmap, a very high level of analysis. To prove the vision and projections of the roadmap requires additional detailed business line modernization analysis. 
This detailed analysis should link the Forest Service mission, vision, goals, and objectives (strategic intent) within an initiative area to adjustments in the value chains of the Forest Service, its partners, its suppliers, and its customers. Adjustments are made to targeted value chains by adding, modifying, or terminating their component processes, and so strategic objectives can be achieved. Value chain adjustments capable of supporting Forest Service e-Gov strategies will need to be identified by analyzing the ability of e-Gov/e-Business technologies to enable more efficient ways to deliver government goods and services and also to enhance these goods and services by adding to and improving the information content embedded in them.

The period of performance for this contract is a base of two years from October 1, 2005, and up to three (3) one (1) year options.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The NIST Acquisition Management Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), Only One Source Reasonable Available, with INEL, Inc, P.O. Box 147, Stratham, NH 038850147 for the replacement of the upgrade the Scintag motor controller, software and PC with an INEL motor controller and INEL Symphonix software package.  The INEL High Voltage Generator is part of the existing NIST X-ray System.

Destination Information:  Indefinite quantities will be delivered to various locations.

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The subject requirement is for the acquisition of forty-four (44) NSNs with various item descriptions and end items.  This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Classes 2520, 2920, 2940, and 3040.   The requirement will result in an award of an Indefinite Delivery Type Contract for which Delivery Orders may be placed for one (1) year.  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed five (5) years.   See Note(s): 12 and 26.  The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of September 22, 2005.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The AFFTC, 412 Test Wing (412TW/EWBC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing and testing Microwave Pyrmidal Flame-Retardant Foam Absorbers in accordance with the following Statement of Work:
STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MICROWAVE PYRMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS. 1.0 SCOPE: The Electronic Warfare Directorate has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of foam absorbers in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 1,680 EACH 72” foam absorbers and 36 EACH 24” foam absorbers is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies. 2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS IEEE STANDARD 1128 –“Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz”. NRL Report 8093 – “Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers”. 
3.0 REQUIREMENTS:  3.1 Testing. Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed done using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80Mhz to 500Mhz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values in the chart below: (See break points on tale below.) The break points are listed in the table below: Frequency (MHz) Reflections at Normal Incidence (dB) 80 -20, 120 – 30, 200 – 40, 300 – 40, 500 – 45. 3.2 Manufacturing and Delivery Constraints. Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance. The manufacturing and shipping of the absorber must be coordinated with the BAF test schedule.  At this point in time, delivery must be scheduled to begin during the week of 28 Nov – 2 Dec 2005. The BAF does not have storage resources to store the large volume of absorber and would like to install the absorber over an approximate 1 to 2-week delivery schedule.  The manufacturer must have a sufficiently large production capacity and indoor storage to be able to deliver the entire order in as short as a 1 week window for timely deployment in the BAF.  The last delivery of the entire order cannot exceed 2 weeks from the first delivery. 3.3 Fire Retardant.
Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  3.4 Physical Characteristics for RAM:  “A low frequency test area design requires larger Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) in order to eliminate multi-path reflections from the floor to the test zone.   a. Implementation of the 72” RAM on the BAF chamber floor requires it to be tilted at various angles in order to obtain an attenuation of at least 20 dB at 100MHz.  In order to accurately tilt the 72” RAM and provide the greatest layout flexibility, three separate RAM wedge angles are needed, 45°, 30°, and 15°.  Each wedge type should be color coded to provide easy identification.  Velcro with suitable strength will be attached to each wedge and single piece of 72” pyramidal RAM.  The wedges will be loaded with the same carbon solution density as the 72” pyramidal RAM.  In addition, special RAM pieces needed for the specular region of the RAM layout will be required.  These pieces are made by using a special 2’x2’x2’ cube with the same carbon solution density as the 72” pyramidal RAM.  They will fit in the area where the 72” pyramidal RAM is titled at 45° and pointing in opposite directions.  The cubes will be made with Velcro on two adjoining surfaces so that two 24” pyramidal RAM pieces can be attached to them.  The total number of cubes needed for the specular region is 36 each.  The total number of 24” pyramidal RAM is 36 each. 	b.  Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80 MHz to 500 MHz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values table cited above: High frequency reflectivity measurements are required on 10% of the full lot of 72” pyramidal RAM.  The frequency band for this measurement is from 6 to 18 GHz at near normal incident angle.  Test samples will be taken from sub-lots throughout the manufacture run and are deliverable (A001). c. Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance.  d. Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  
e. Note: The physical characteristics of the 72” RAM: * Standard carbon loading is 1.1 lbs/ft3, further modeling by the manufacturer may show that a lighter loading will give better performance in the BAF setup.  The manufacturer must be equipped to vary the loading of the absorber at the time of manufacturing with no additional cost.  Various carbon loadings may be specified by the government for different lots.  No more then 3 lots are anticipated for the total order.
3.5 Past Performance Requirements. Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: 
a.	RAM manufactured to specification (SOW Para 3.2, 3.3 & 3.4)
b.	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3) as spelled out in the BAF safety document (SOW Para 3.3)
c.	Delivery similar quantity of RAM within the narrow time frame (SOW Para 3.2).

3.6 Program Management. The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor’s ability to meet and satisfy the performance and schedule requirements of this SOW.

Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements for providing and testing Microwave Pyrmidal Flame-Retardant Foam Absorbers are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide listed above.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Amendment 2: The purpose of this amendment is to modify the statement of work.  The statement of work below replaces the statement of work located in the synopsis/request for quote posted on 8/05/05.  The response date for submitting proposals has been extended to 4:00PM,  September 13, 2005.   Title: Bioreactor Landfill Design Guidance Period of Performance: 1 year from award date Bioreactor landfill technology in the US is rapidly changing.  The US EPA has undertaken the effort to evaluate this technology to insure its safe implementation.  To support this effort  EPA/ORD is planning to develop standardized design guidelines for bioreactor landfills.  Thus, providing guidance to the state regulators who are faced with increased permit requests as a result of the RD&D rule and can help set the stage for future federal regulations if the agency were so  inclined to go in that direction.   The purpose of the task is to develop design guidelines for bioreactor landfills operating under EPA's bioreactor landfill research development and demonstration rule or any other applicable state or federal regulations.  Liquids addition design, Liquids  collection and waste stability design in particular need to be addressed in the final report of this project. 1. Identification of liquid addition system design alternatives.  Gathering all current information available pertaining to the different types of liquids addition systems for landfills:  Source liquids; Leachate storage. 2. Development of design guidelines for liquids addition amounts. This step will evaluate the requirements for moisture addition to landfills. 3. Development of design guidelines for liquids addition rates.  This step will evaluate the considerations that go into  deciding the rate that liquids should be added to the landfill.  Many factors go into deciding the rate of liquid addition, including available liquids supply, leachate collection system issues, gas collection issues, and ability of the landfill to accept the liquids.  Evaluate liquids addition  rates from a broad perspective, not from the perspective of a particular liquids addition technology. 4. Development of design guidelines for sizing, spacing, construction and operation of individual liquids addition systems.  The liquids addition systems to be reviewed will include (at a minimum)  buried horizontal trenches, vertical wells, surface area sources (e.g., ponds, drip irrigation), buried area sources, and surface trenches.  Fundamental principles of saturated-unsaturated flow will be used to develop analytical predictive equations for moisture movement as a function of flow rate,  pressure and waste characteristics (e.g., isotropy, permeability).  Where analytical relationships are limited, numerical modeling will be conducted to develop design relationships.  Task	Due	Description	Deliverables 1	1 week after award	Project kickoff meeting finalizing design parameters to be  examined particularly liquid addition and leachate collection	N/A 2	2 weeks after award	QA Plan Submitted to EPA	Draft QA Project Plan (QAPP) 3	After QAPP Approved by EPA	Begin work on the design document	 4	8 weeks after award	Follow up meeting	 5	5 Months after award	Prepare and submit draft  report outlining liquid types and addition rates.

Deliverables 	Deliverables in table 1 and include QA project plan, two draft reports,  at least one technical peer reviewed journal article.  The reports shall be written in accordance with EPA's report format guidelines.  Any publication of any information collected as a result of this research must be cleared by the US EPA and the TOM prior to submission to any publication outlet  and must adhere to project QA guidelines agreed to by both parties prior to project. All documents may be accessed through the EPA's home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov). The direct link URL is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. It is the responsibility of offerors to frequently check  FEDBIZOPPS or the EPA website address for updates or changes. No hard copies will be made available.

Re: Request for Information –RFI-
Reference # 2DPSCC-05-RFI-StructuredAuthoring-


The U. S. Postal Service is seeking information regarding increases in the development and lifecycle support costs for documentation of new mail processing equipment.  Over the last decade the U.S. Postal Service’s new mail processing equipment has greatly increased in quantity, physical size, and complexity.  The corresponding increase in the quantity of the maintenance documentation, the complexity of the documentation, its various formats, and its increase in lifecycle costs has led to this Request for Information (RFI).


Attachment A provides information regarding this initiative, including minimum requirements that should be met by each responder.  Your response to this RFI must specifically discuss Attachment A requirements as they correspond to structured authoring of technical documents and creating an improved process of constructing and managing electronic maintenance documents.


This is not a prequalification and may or may not result in a solicitation. If a solicitation is issued, it shall be posted in FedBizOps. The contracting officer will notify all respondents of any determinations or findings.


We would appreciate your responses by September 7, 2005 indicating your Capabilities and ability to meet the Minimum Requirements as described in Attachment A to this RFI.


Send your responses via U.S. Mail to:

William C. Matthei, C.P.M.

Attachment A
Overview:

The United States Postal Service (USPS) Maintenance Technical Support Center (MTSC) provides maintenance documentation for mail processing equipment and building systems in various formats to approximately 40,000 maintenance employees.  MTSC seeks to accomplish two objectives as a result of this Request for Information (RFI). Firstly, MTSC desires to move to a structured authoring environment for technical publications. Secondly, MTSC desires to investigate and create an improved process of constructing electronic maintenance documentation. 

Reason for Change:

The amount and complexity of field maintenance documentation has greatly increased over the last decade due to the amount, size, and complexity of new mail processing equipment. This has caused an increase in both development and lifecycle support costs. This initiative is designed to reduce those costs, and at the same time add additional benefits in the form of quality, access, distribution, and usage.

Expected Benefits:

•	Utilizing a single data source for multiple media formats;
•	Greater control and consistency in formatting;
•	Time savings in formatting;
•	Flexibility in publishing electronic documents;
•	Reduced time in converting to electronic documents;
•	Additional features available for electronic documents;
•	Consistency with changing technology.

Potential suppliers:

USPS desires to contract with a supplier who has significant expertise in the following:

•	Implementation of the move to structured authoring
•	Implementation of the move from unstructured to structured FrameMaker software.
•	Experience in developing electronic documentation.
•	Experience in creating electronic documentation (HTML, XML, etc.) from unstructured and structured FrameMaker software.

The intent of this RFI is to determine who the suppliers for this service are. 
Notification to Respondents:

The contracting officer will notify all respondents of their status. 




Minimum Requirements:

The following is a current non-exclusive set of constraints (minimum requirements) that should be met for any responder seeking pre-qualification:

1.	Creation of Structured Environment
The respondent must propose how they will create the structured authoring environment. This shall include the creation of structure definition, creation of templates, creation of conversion files, etc.

2.	Creation of Electronic Conversion Process
The respondent must propose various options to convert maintenance manuals to electronic versions for posting to the MTSC web site. The proposal shall include options for converting legacy FrameMaker documents and structured FrameMaker documents.

3.	Implementation Planning
The respondent must propose a plan that depicts the implementation of both short term and long term goals and objectives. The plan shall outline the most beneficial method of achieving improvements over time. The plan should outline both MTSC and supplier activities to reach objectives and show how and when the activities interact. Plan shall specify all resources required for full implementation (supplier personnel, MTSC personnel, and hardware/software). The plan shall also insure that any system developed will easily interface with future growth and technology.

4.	Training
The respondent must propose a training program that will accomplish moving MTSC to authoring in structured FrameMaker and the creation of electronic manuals. Supplier shall describe training materials, classroom instruction, self-guided learning, and other potential options.

Capabilities:

1.	The respondent must provide a brief overview of the company’s size, structure, number of years in business providing services such as those required by USPS.
2.	The respondent must provide the name of three (3) structured authoring environment document conversion projects which are comparable or larger than USPS including a brief overview of the process performed for each project.
3.	The respondent must discuss their approach to quality assurance.

<DESC>ONLY THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN MODIFIED, TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
<B>INTRODUCTION:</b> National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks industry collaborators to participate in coordinated clinical, epidemiological and behavioral studies that will analyze the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery and its impact on the health and well-being of patients with extreme obesity, and identify the kinds of patients who are most likely to benefit.  Industry collaborators able to provide clinical expertise in the evaluation, screening, dosing, and follow up of patients at risk for venous thromboembolism following bariatric surgery; and/or evaluate the pathogenesis, genetic factors, and other pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative features or factors that are believed to affect the outcomes following bariatric surgery; and/or identify unique methods to evaluate alternate bariatric surgical therapies are sought.
<P>
A prospective database of adult patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery will be created by the NIH Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Clinical Consortium that will allow the prospective evaluation and longitudinal follow-up of a large group of patients in a standardized fashion.  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological, and mechanisms of action research in patients undergoing bariatric surgery at six clinical sites using a standardized and coordinated approach to their evaluation, operative procedure, and follow up.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the pathogenesis, genetic features, and other factors that may affect outcomes after bariatric surgery are also anticipated.  It is expected that the following will be participating: six clinical sites at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pennsylvania), Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital and Cornell University (New York), East Carolina Medical Center (North Carolina), Neuropsychiatric Research Institute (North Dakota), University of California, Davis (California) and the University of Washington (Washington); and a Data Coordinating Center at the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh.  
<P> 
<B>SUMMARY:</b> The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institute of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services is seeking proposals in the form of Capability Statements from companies to enter into a collaborative arrangement to provide clinical expertise in the evaluation, screening, dosing, and follow up of patients at risk for venous thromboembolism following bariatric surgery; and/or identify unique methods to evaluate alternate bariatric surgical therapies.  The collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA’s).  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaborative arrangement to evaluate the pathogenesis, genetic factors, and other pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative features or factors that are believed to affect the outcomes following bariatric surgery. 
<P>
Examples of potential studies include:
(a)  identification of host biomarkers and/or genetic typing factors associated with the development of severe obesity;
(b)  exploration of the pharmacokinetics and dosing regimens for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in bariatric surgery patients;
(c)  evaluation of the possible screening tests for pre-existing thromboembolism; and
(d)  identification of unique methods to evaluate alternate bariatric surgical therapies such as the laparoscopic banding procedure.
<P>
<B>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA's).  CRADA's are agreements, pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), designed to enable certain collaborations between Government and non-government parties and/or laboratories.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADA’s are neither grants nor contracts for the procurement of goods or services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a collaborator in a Clinical Trial or a CRADA.  Under both a Clinical Trial agreement and a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise, but not funding, to the collaboration.  Under a CRADA a collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise and funding to the collaboration. The collaborator, under a CRADA, receives an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use.
<P>
<B>STUDY GOAL:</b>
The overall goal of this study is to perform coordinated clinical, epidemiological, and mechanisms of action research in patients undergoing bariatric surgery at six clinical sites using a standardized and coordinated approach to their evaluation, operative procedure, and follow up.  In this longitudinal and observational study, a database will be developed on adult patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery.   The relationship of defined pre- and intra- operative factors to post-surgical outcomes such as weight loss, surgical complications, and co-morbidity improvements will be studied. The LABS consortium has an interest in assessing in more detail the pre-operative risk factors, screening tests, and dosing of prophylactic agents used for venous thromboembolism prevention.  In addition, the LABS consortium is interested in assessing in more detail other potential factors that affect surgical outcomes.  Furthermore, LABS is interested in the possible future study and identification of host genetic factors.    
<P>
<B>OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION:</b> 
Whole blood will be collected from participants enrolled in LABS studies.  Serum and plasma from participants in the study will be collected.  Tissue from liver biopsies may also be available.
<P>
<B>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:</b>  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages.  The Selection Committee will be considering its selection based upon data in the Capability Statement which addresses the following selection criteria below.   If no data are available, the potential Collaborator should so indicate.
<Br>
1.	The Capability Statement should provide specific details of the methods and materials to be utilized in the evaluation, screening, dosing, and expertise in following patients at risk for venous thromboembolism, if venous thromboembolism is the subject of the proposal.  Potential collaborators should provide evidence for proposed dosing regimens, possible strategies to assess administration of medication, proposed methods for assessing drug levels and pharmacokinetics.<Br>
2.	The Capability Statement should provide specific details and proof of research expertise in the area of the genetics of obesity, if genetics is the subject of the proposal.<Br>
3.	The Capability Statement should provide evidence and specific details of expertise in areas related to the pathogenesis of severe obesity and/or the expertise in the area of proposed factors believed to be related to surgical outcomes.  
4.	The Capability Statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies if a CTA or CRADA is entered (see CRADA:  http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf ).
<P>
<B>TERMS:</b> The Collaborator will be expected to execute either a Clinical Trial Agreement or a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).  Examples of each can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/forms.htm. No funding from the government is available.
<P>
<B>SUBMISSION DATES:</b>  Only written Capability Statements received by the NIDDK on or before September 9, 2005 will be considered.  Applicants meeting the criteria set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicant’s own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings and expertise pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study’s Steering Committee, date to be determined.

<DESC>NOTICE:  The solicitation number for this Request for Proposal is changed to AG-3187-S-05-0008.  This solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business website (www.fbo.gov) on or about September 7, 2005.


Purpose
The Forest Service, an agency within the Department of Agriculture, seeks contractor services to provide management and technical support service for their e-Gov and Enterprise Architecture (EA) Programs.  The resulting contract will provide the Forest Service with a vehicle for fast and effective access to acquire state-of-the-art enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service e-Gov EA initiatives.  This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract with provisions for Firm Fixed Price and Time and Material pricing arrangements under individual task orders. 

Background
As an agency of the United States Federal Government, the Forest Service understands the e-Government transformation objective as “the use of digital technologies to transform government operations in order to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and service delivery.” The Federal vision for electronic government is “an order of magnitude improvement in the federal government’s value to the citizen; with decisions in minutes or hours, not weeks or months.” The progress made within the Forest Service’s e-Gov EA endeavor will have a direct correlation to how well the agency transitions to delivering information and services in electronic form over the Internet. Succeeding in this effort will require a detailed understanding of the value chains that now support the agency’s information and service delivery, as well as the ability to modify these value chains to achieve the desired results, where necessary.
The Forest Service is comprised of more than 35,000 permanent employees and over 100,000 seasonal and volunteer employees making it the largest agency within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). As part of this larger enterprise and mission, the Forest Service EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations must fit within the USDA and federal level EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations.
For each initiative area, the Forest Service e-Gov roadmap describes the dimensions of business needs, or opportunities, along with the e-Gov “foundation” technologies that can be employed to meet these needs or capitalize on opportunities. There are 14 foundation technologies identified in the roadmap, many of which the USDA and the Forest Service does not yet own or license. Each Forest Service e-Gov initiative area can benefit from employing an average of nine of the foundation technologies, and each such technology has been identified as having promise to support e-Gov transformation for an average of 12 to 13 initiative areas. These statistics represent, as does the balance of the Forest Service e-Gov Strategy and Roadmap, a very high level of analysis. To prove the vision and projections of the roadmap requires additional detailed business line modernization analysis. 
This detailed analysis should link the Forest Service mission, vision, goals, and objectives (strategic intent) within an initiative area to adjustments in the value chains of the Forest Service, its partners, its suppliers, and its customers. Adjustments are made to targeted value chains by adding, modifying, or terminating their component processes, and so strategic objectives can be achieved. Value chain adjustments capable of supporting Forest Service e-Gov strategies will need to be identified by analyzing the ability of e-Gov/e-Business technologies to enable more efficient ways to deliver government goods and services and also to enhance these goods and services by adding to and improving the information content embedded in them.

The period of performance for this contract is a base of two years from October 1, 2005, and up to three (3) one (1) year options.

<CONTACT>Teresa Martinez, Contracting Officer, 505-845-4127, tmartinez@doeal.gov;Marialyn Achille-Argaez, Contract Specialist, 505-845-6069, machille-argaez@doeal.gov
<DESC>DESIGN, INTEGRATION, CONSTRUCTION, COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGINEERING SERVICES (DICCE), DE-RP52-06NA26990.  Proposal Disallowed Reason: This is a sources sought announcement NOT a request for proposals. Description: The National Nuclear Security Administrationâ€™s Second Line of Defense (SLD) Program, which is overseen by the Office of International Materials Protection and Emergency Cooperation (NA-25), is seeking to identify qualified vendors for Design, Integration, Construction, Communications, and Engineering Services (DICCE).  These DICCE services include installation of radiation detection and communication equipment at international land border crossings, airports & seaports.  Related experience working and contracting in overseas locations is required. All work requires written agreements with the host Government.  Because agreements and future funding levels are not assured, it is difficult to accurately estimate the ultimate magnitude of the work. However, SLD expects that the DICCE services contractor will have to potentially support the installation of radiation detectors and communication equipment in over 30 mega-ports and up to two hundred transit locations in over 30 foreign countries over the next five years.  DICCE services may be required in up to ten countries concurrently with each location at a different stage in the implementation.  The level of effort and type of services may vary in each location. The program is considering several strategies for this work, including awarding separate contracts in functional areas of construction, communications, and maintenance work.  However, the program is also considering combining all requirements into one Statement of Work. Multiple awards may be made under either scenario. If multiple awards are made, the program may elect to award individual task orders based upon a competitive award among the awardees, regional expertise, and/or  contractor resources and availability.  In the event the program is able to obtain timely agreements in all planned locations and pursues a strategy that includes all services at each site, the rough order of magnitude for all work under this notice could be in the four to six hundred million dollar ($400 - $600M) range.  The Government makes no commitment or assurance that either the full magnitude of work will ultimately be ordered or that any of the approaches mentioned here will be pursued or employed. Notices to Vendors:  The SLD program is considering several strategies for this work, and therefore may pursue additional methods of identifying suitable approaches and qualified vendors for this work.  All interested parties are strongly encouraged to keep watching this site and this action.  All notices regarding this effort will be posted on DOE E-Center and on FedBizOpps. Services Sought: Design Services:  Provide complete and certified architectural and engineering design services. â€¢ Sensor systems â€“ nuclear radiation, video, motion, and security systems â€¢ Buildings and structures to house alarm station and emergency centers â€¢ Site access, boundary and perimeter control systems for seaports, airports, border crossings â€“ pedestrians, vehicles, and trains â€¢ Communication systems that include microwave, web based communications, fiber optics, cable and radio-frequency systems â€¢ Training centers, maintenance and repair facilities, and test beds Integration Services: â€¢ Coordinate with third parties and Government Furnished Equipment contractors on equipment specifications, deliveries, and installation requirements â€¢ Coordinate with host country representatives on design and construction activities to ensure a seamless implementation process â€¢ Ensure all construction and installation activities have been accomplished. Construction Services:  Working in conjunction with U.S. and international contractors, provide facility construction, sensor system installation, communication system installation, landscaping, asbestos and lead abatement, utility system upgrades such as water (portable and fire), telephone/computer systems (other communications), and emergency power. Communications Services:  Provide communications systems that collect, store, and display data received from the radiation monitoring locations.  The data includes radiation monitor data, video and user data entries.  The systems may include intra-site communications between computing systems(s) and the sensor devises. The SLD architecture is made up of several system elements.  Not all ports or countries will require each of these elements and some elements may need to be modified to operate under site-specific conditions.  The elements may include: â€¢ Local Alarm Station (LAS) â€¢ Central Alarm Station (CAS) â€¢ Mother CAS  (connects two or more CASs) â€¢ Regional Center â€¢ National Center Engineering Services:  Provide specialized expertise and engineering services required for design and construction activities at SLD portal sites, and in support of SLD mission requirements.

The purpose of this notice is to solicit capability information from those small businesses interested in performing this work.   This information will help CMS determine if this work should be competed on an unrestricted basis, or if this work could be set aside for small businesses (potentially as a 8(a), SDB, or small business set aside).   There is a summary of the project below.  If you would be interested submitting capability information, please provide a high-level capability demonstration that describes how you could perform these services.  Please do not submit pre-established marketing material or refer to your websites.   Submit a specific document addressing the following:  1) Describe how you could provide personnel with the right kinds of experience to perform this work.  CMS  considers experience with Medicare data center processing and Medicare regulations critical; 2) Describe how you will provide the right kinds of resources, including infrastructure, to perform the services; 3) Describe your teaming partners (if any); 4) Describe any experience you or your teaming partners have that is relevant to this effort; 5) Describe the contract vehicles you possess that could offer streamlined procurement avenues for this effort (STARS, GSA Schedule, GWACs); and 6) Describe your business size and status.  The page limit for this submission is 20 pages.   You can email your information to the undersigned at andrew.mummert@cms.hhs.gov by September 27, 2005.  CMS will not share the information you provide with other parties.  SUMMARY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROJECT FOLLOWS:  The TSC shall provide support services required for transitioning Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) claims processing from the current Medicare data centers to the Enterprise Data Centers (EDCs). The EDC is a critical component of the initiative to successfully modernize CMS’s IT environment as part of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA).

Traditional Medicare claims are currently processed at 15 Medicare data centers throughout the country. The processing of Medicare claims involves 33 companies, known as Medicare Contractors, who use four different systems to process claims (Parts A and B, DMERC and CWF). CMS now maintains 54 separate contracts for this work. The EDC will provide greater control of operations, greater flexibility in meeting future challenges and a reduction in the number of data centers.

Due to the unique Medicare environment, experience/knowledge with Medicare data centers and Medicare regulations and claims processing is critical. The TSC shall support implementation of all EDC-related tasks, including facility and application-specific infrastructure deployment, and establishing and monitoring the application deployment project plan.

The TSC shall work with CMS, the Medicare Data Communications Network (MDCN) provider, and the local phone company in establishing connectivity to the MDCN. Connectivity must be provided to the appropriate site mainframes and the EDC. The TSC shall provide infrastructure items including, hardware, LAN configurations, cabling, and workstation connectivity necessary to support the TSC.

The TSC shall be responsible for tracking, monitoring and reporting the operations and project status for each data center transition, ensuring that milestones and deliverables are met. The TSC shall perform onsite activities at the current data centers to analyze all aspects of the current processing environments. The TSC will provide its findings to the EDCs and CMS to support the construction of corresponding environments at the EDCs. The TSC shall provide oversight for all EDC activities required to develop and test the Medicare processing environments. The TSC shall be responsible for handling updates and distribution of all communication documents and for facilitating conference calls.

The TSC shall have personnel that are experts in the field of mainframe computer systems, subsystems and file structures. The majority of data centers that the TSC will work with run either the Z/os or OS390 operating systems. The TSC will need to be able to review, interpret and map programs, JCL, and data files. The TSC will need to be able to review, analyze, comment, write project plans, map files and libraries on the full line of data center management to include, but limited to, DASD Management, JCL Management, Library Management, Security Management, Capacity Management, Disaster Recovery Management, Tape Management, Job Management/Scheduling, and Output Management.

The TSC shall also support the transition of provider and clearinghouse/vendor connectivity to the (Standard Front End) SFE, including coordinating the establishment of network connectivity  to provide an interface between the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and the SFE, clearinghouses, and providers for exchange of inbound and outbound electronic transactions.

The TSC shall have all personnel in place and ready to begin transition activities not more than two weeks after contract award. The TSC shall provide dedicated transition support teams for each data center transitioning to the EDC. Each team shall possess expert Medicare FFS processing knowledge (Part A, Part B, DMERC, CWF, HIPAA and EDI expertise) and experience with Medicare Data Center transitions.

<SUBJECT>63 -- MicroHound
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy’s physical security needs, is looking for one or more companies in the trace detection market to engage in commercialization of Sandia’s portable MicroHound ™ system.  This portable chemical detection technology is especially applicable to the detection of explosives and narcotics but may also be useful for the detection of chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals (TIC).  Sandia developed this technology with light weight, sensitivity, ease of use, speed, and accuracy in mind, and as new technologies have become available the system has been improved.  Thus, the base capabilities have been retained as emerging technologies have improved the system’s performance.

It is expected that successful partners will license Sandia’s existing technology and will work with Sandia to improve and optimize the MicroHound ™ system for various markets (i.e., first responders, explosives, narcotics, TICs, etc.).  Because of this expectation, potential partners must document their ability to move similar products to market and demonstrate that they have the resources and expertise to design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional trace detection systems.  Sandia also expects successful partners to commercialize the entire MicroHound ™ system and not to focus primarily on individual components.

Sandia will give preference to commercial system integrators with well-documented experience in trace detection of explosives and narcotics, and companies with successful product offerings.  Sandia anticipates granting one or more licenses, up to and including exclusive rights, for the MicroHound ™ technologies to qualified participants.  Sandia licenses typically include up-front licensing fees (a portion of which may cover Sandia’s technical assistance to the partner), royalties, annual minimums, and performance milestones.  Successful partners may license rights to several issued patents, patents pending, and copyrighted works related to the subject technology. 

The MicroHound ™ is a handheld system combining, in a single platform small chemical sensors with large-volume sampling and preconcentration to detect low levels of chemicals of interested such as common explosives and narcotics.  As an integrated package, the MicroHound ™ operates in either of two modes: contactless vapor mode or swipe mode.  In vapor mode, the sampling unit draws in a large volume of air and collects heavy organic compounds from the air stream onto a filter.  In swipe mode, the operator swipes a suspicious object’s surface and places the filter in a holder.  The MicroHound ™ system incorporates patented leading edge technologies to enhance the collection and identification of explosives and narcotics. 

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Teresa Montoya by October 21, 2005 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115. Fax (505) 844-8011. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your firm will successfully bring the MicroHound™ technology to market.  This is not a federal government procurement and therefore there will be no debriefing regarding the results of Sandia’s selection process.

This year we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing in-kind or monetary donations to give away in a drawing we are doing for the Club Member Appreciation Event. We would like to be able to give away 100 prizes or more ranging from $5 to $1,000 in value.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on ideas for developing a real time (sub-seconds), stand-off (over 400 meters) detection system for countering road-side IEDs based on chemical vapor signatures.   IEDs represent the greatest threat to the security of our military forces and civilians.  Approaches towards solving this problem may include pre-treatment of the target area with materials for molecular recognition of target explosive vapors or direct interrogation of target area using laser-based approaches.  From an operational standpoint, it is desired that the technology solution be such that it may be implemented either from an unmanned aerial or ground vehicle. Ideas for technologies to counter IEDs should be consistent with this operational strategy. The RFI does not include X-ray, neutron or gamma-ray based methods or any other approach that could pose a potential hazard to military and civilians in the vicinity of the threat. 


DARPA solicits potential performers to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the government in formulating a potential program. DARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected robustness, affordability, weight, size and power requirements of the proposed approach. 


The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. 


Responses should be limited to two pages for any given concept. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. RFI responses should be received no later than COB Oct. 10, 2005. 


RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to:

This must be a hardware solution not a software solution because of bandwidth issues. The system must project the instructor’s screen onto each student screen individually, by group of workstations or to all workstations. The instructor can monitor any student workstation from the instructor workstation.  Student screens can be displayed on the projector screen.  The instructor workstation must have the ability to control student workstations. Firms responding to this RFI are asked to provide the following information in their initial response: company’s full name, business size, address, point of contact, and a clear indication as to whether or not they can provide the item the government is seeking..  Final responses to this RFI will be due on 09 September 2005.  Responses will be reviewed and may result in further clarifications to further explore commercial capabilities with selected respondents.  As industry may expect to see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, portions of the response containing proprietary information should be clearly marked as such.

<SUBJECT>R -- Commercial Activities for Credentials Verification Services
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY.  INTRODUCTION.  The U. S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) is conducting market research as part of the Preliminary Planning phase of a potential commercial activities competition in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) require each accredited Military Treatment Facility (MTF) to perform privileging of military and civilian health care providers practicing at their facility.  This entails a complete review and verification of a provider's Individual Credentials File (ICF) (licensing, training, education, specialty information, assignment history data, etc.) to determine qualifications and competency prior to being granted privileges to perform duties at the MTF.  For those health care positions that do not require privileging, a complete review and verification of an Individual Professional File (IPF) for determination of qualifications and job-specific competency is still required.  The purpose of the market research is to assist with scoping and grouping of commercial functions, determining the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, and confirming whether sources would be available to satisfy agency requirements should there be a standard public-private competition.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract will not result depending on the outcome of this market research but a separate solicitation may be issued in the future.  RESEARCH METHOD.  The method of conducting market research for this requirement is through such means as informal Internet searches, telephone interviews, and discussions with potential commercial sources and industry experts.  This questionnaire has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of this research.  A separate questionnaire form will be used to record market information obtained from each commercial source included in the research.  Note: This is to advise any commercial source that provides information as part of this market research process that their information will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should they choose to submit a proposal to any solicitation that may result.  TITLE:  Commercial Activities for Credentials Verification Services.  LOCATION:  U. S. Navy Healthcare Support Office, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.  CREDENTIALS VERIFICATION SERVICES REQUIREMENTS:  Credentials Verification services for approximately 18,000 Active Duty, Reserve, Civil Service, and Contract providers to include: (1) Generate, collect, and fully process Initial Provider Applications (Individual Credentials Files (ICF)) and update the Centralized Credentials and Quality Assurance System (CCQAS) database at 900 occurrences annually; (2) Generate, collect, and fully process Initial Provider Applications (Individual Professional Files (IPF)) and update CCQAS at 1,000 occurrences annually; (3) Generate, collect, and fully process Renewal Provider Applications (ICF) and update the Centralized Credentials and Quality Assurance System (CCQAS) database at 4,600 occurrences annually; (4) Generate, collect, and fully process Renewal Provider Applications (Individual Professional Files (IPF)) and update CCQAS at 2,500 occurrences annually; (5) Generate and collect Peer Recommendations (2 per specialty) and update CCQAS at 12,000 occurrences annually; (6) Generate and collect Civilian Employment Inquiries (primarily Reservists, but some Active Duty) and update CCQAS at 14,000 occurrences annually; (7) Collect Performance Appraisal Reports (PARS) and Clinical Appraisal Reports (CARS) to complete applications and update CCQAS at 18,000 occurrences annually; (8) Collect Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) certificates and update CCQAS at 4,000 occurrences annually; (9) Process and collect National Physician Data Bank (NPDB)/Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) queries and update CCQAS at 14,000 occurrences annually; (10) Primary Source Verify (PSV) all state licenses (at renewal period and perpetual) and update CCQAS at 40,000 occurrences annually; (11) PSV all board certification renewals and update in CCQAS at 7,500 occurrences annually; (12) Collect and upload provider photographs at approximately 2,200 occurrences annually; (13) PSV qualifying degrees at approximately 1,500 occurrences annually; (14) PSV PG school/Advanced training (internship, residencies, fellowships, Dental PG training) at approximately 2,250 occurrences annually.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to correct an error in the Government’s initial notice of Intent to Sole Source to Professional Computer Technology Associates (PCTA). The Symantec Quick Answers Database is not a proprietary product of PCTA, but Symantec. In September of 1998, Symantec dropped all in-house sales and support for Q&A, officially referring all sales and support inquiries to Professional Computer Technology Associates (PCTA). In June 2000, Lantica Software, LLC was formed as a company to develop the Sesame Database Manager, a Q&A compatible follow-on product. VA has chosen the Sesame Database Manager product as it next generation VAFTP platform. Due to the proprietary nature of Q&A 5.0 and Sesame Database Manager applications, PCTA is the logical single source of knowledge and resources for helping VA migrate the next generation VAFTP.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to BIOLOG, INC., 21124 Cabot Blvd., Hayward, CA 94545 3716 for the purchase of an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System, U.S. Version with Computer plus video FG, also including pipettor, turbidimeter and model 3531 turbidimeter with power adaptor, installation and validation package, maintenance, shipping and accessories.

The Phenotypic MicroArray will provide information not on genetic characteristics, but on the expression of genes.  It will also allow the characterization of pathogenic strains and the effects of genetic changes on phenotypic expression. Two thousand different phenotypic characteristics can be measured simultaneously.   The instrument will measure biochemical characteristics of foodborne pathogens as well as antibiotic and chemical resistance. 

The FDA has a need for an instrument that is capable of routine and accurate characterization of foodborne pathogens with special emphasis on pathological consequences of genetic or environmental changes.  It is necessary to keep the equipment in full operating condition and to minimize down time to meet the workload, therefore, a One Year Full Service Maintenance Plan after installation is required. 

An award will be made in fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. This is not a request for quotes; however, sources may submit descriptive literature, which fully demonstrate their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.     A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Apagan@oc.fda.gov.     No phone calls will be accepted.         This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>This is combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 13.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This request for proposals (RFP) is being issued under Solicitation No. GS-00P-05-CY-7023.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541611 with a size standard of $6 million.

GSA Workplace 20.20 Scope of Work – Deep Dive (Rapid Engagement) Tool Demonstration.

(1)  Goals and Objectives.   The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service (GSA/PBS) is seeking the services of a contractor (Government reserves the right to award one or multiple contracts as a result of this combination synopsis/solicitation) in 
developing and piloting tools and methods (such as verbal reporting) as approval for the Deep Dive Rapid Engagement Process.  The contractor’s methods should also be responsive to gauging organizational culture, reward systems and change management. 

The key tasks are: (1) to provide an understanding of the organizational context and business goals as the basis for design; (2) to contribute to the refinement of the “Deep Dive” through identification of lessons learned and the development or refinement of client engagement tools and methodologies; (3) to provide guidance to the design process to assure that organizational goals and objectives are addressed in the design solution and implementation.  These tasks are described more fully below. 

(2)  Background:  Introduction – Workplace 20.20 and the “Deep Dive” 

The U. S. GSA/PBS, developed the Workplace 20.20 Program to develop a strategic approach for delivering real estate solutions to its clients, with a focus on addressing organizational change and evolving work processes in the Federal government.  The program differs from other workplace-making efforts in several ways.  First and foremost, the aim is delivering workplaces that facilitate organizational goals and business strategy. 

By using workspace as a strategic tool in meeting business goals, GSA aims to distinguish itself in ways that make a difference to its customers.  By using the WorkPlace 20.20 process, GSA is better able to foster highly responsive “workplace solutions” for its customers as well as to support its Agency environmental responsibilities.  However as the result of lessons learned over the course of the WorkPlace 20.20 Pilot Program undertaken thus far, the need for a more streamlined approach that could address a larger volume of work in a highly efficient, accurate and rapid way became apparent.  The Deep Dive Rapid Engagement Process was formulated as a result.  Under this scope, the Deep Dive will be further developed and tested to resolve any issue prior to launching in on a larger scale.

The Deep Dive requires understanding current internal and external drivers for change as they affect the client Agency.  In addition, it is intended to uncover existing and desired ways of working, as well as the cultural and organizational factors that can inhibit and facilitate change.  These issues are analyzed prior to the development of workplace concepts and solutions in the Design Charrette Phase, which will follow the Deep Dive.  The facility solutions resulting from this two-step process shall embody sustainable design objectives that promote healthy, flexible, and productive workplaces that can enhance user satisfaction, reduce reconfiguration costs, minimize waste, support facility reuse, and help attract or retain valued staff. 

A second differentiator for the Deep Dive, as for Workplace 20.20 has been the use of the Balanced Scorecard as a planning, design and measurement framework.  A Balanced Scorecard Matrix links business goals in four domains (financial, business process, customer and human capital) to changes in behaviors that will facilitate goal attainment, workplace features that support desired behaviors, and measures of success.  The Balanced Scorecard is thus more than just an evaluation tool, it is “the compass”, used throughout the process, and provides a framework for decisions as the design moves forward.  It is intended to ensure that business goals remain in the forefront.  However, the contractor is free to offer a different framework for achieving the same aims, if approved.

The Deep Dive also differs in its emphasis on business value rather than first costs.  The sophisticated cost tracking method currently used in real estate is not accompanied by a similar development in understanding the value of the workplace in other than financial terms.  Just as the dissatisfaction with financial emphasis led to the creation of the Balanced Scorecard for measuring organizational effectiveness, so too does the real estate field need to understand the value of space for other business goals.  WorkPlace 20.20 has developed a methodology for identifying and tracking the business value of the workplace, drawing on the expertise of a wide range of organizational and behavioral scientists, technologists, and designers.  The Deep Dive will continue using these methodologies, though in a streamlined format. 

A final differentiating factor for the Deep Dive is the integration of research and best practices throughout the planning and design process.  This “evidence based” methodology assures that the planning and design process integrates state of the art knowledge, thereby providing a more rational basis for design.  The evaluation teams provide expert briefings on current topics during the planning phase and also contribute to reviews of alternative designs at the Design Charrette to help assure that they reflect current knowledge.  Finally, multi-disciplinary evaluation teams assess each workplace project pre and post, using methodologies developed in the organizational and social sciences.  Lessons learned from the results are fed forward into future projects through briefings and process changes. 

(3)  Scope of Work 

3.1.  Conduct “Deep Dive” Process.

3.1.1.    The Consultant is to submit a proposal for four different organization populations: 

(a)	20-50 people; 
(b)	50-100 people; 
(c)	100-250 people; and,
(d)	250-500 people; 

3.1.2.	 Review background materials prepared by GSA prior to the site visit for the organizational assessment. 

3.1.3.	 Conduct a visioning session using the Balanced Scorecard Matrix and Performance Map Methodology, or some other approved methodology.  The session should: identify internal and external drivers for change and how changes are affecting business goals and strategy in the four BSC domains (customer, financial, business process and human capital).  The outcome is a strategic framework for the workplace that is developed more fully in the remaining tasks. 

Deliverable:  Presentation to the leadership team on results of the visiting session. 

3.1.4.	 Conduct an analysis of group work processes and work styles.  This will involve use of rapid engagement “Rapid Assessment/Deep Dive methods to assess informal social networks and key work activities.  The methods are to be used in group settings and will identify: key relationships within and between groups; current constraints; and reasons for existing problems and constraints.  Group work styles will stress how people spend their time and what spaces they use. 

3.1.5.	 Conduct behavioral observations and analysis of space utilization.  This task will provide information on existing patterns of space use.  Tools are expected to include photography, behavioral mapping, shadowing, and occupancy analysis of current spaces. 

3.1.6.	 Additional interviews as needed.  The consultant will conduct additional interviews and group sessions with the client organization as determined on site. 

3.1.7.	 Synthesis of information.  This task will involve assessment of information from all of the tasks to identify and prioritize key issues, themes, and three diagrammatic concepts for client evaluation within a prescribed timeline (three to five days from arrival on site, depending on the size and complexity of the project.)  The preferred concept will provide the starting point for the design, which is to be more fully explored in the Design Workshop. 

Deliverables:  (1)  Presentation of findings to the client for feedback and discussion; (2) Rapid Assessment “Deep Dive” brief (in presentation format) that includes revisions based on feedback from the client to be submitted no later than five (5) days after the “Deep Dive” site visit. 

Option:   At the Contracting Officer’s option, a series of no less than three design concepts may be included in the Deep Dive Process, depending on the size and complexity of the project.  Typically, this need would be for a small project, with the contract documents being prepared by a GSA indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contractor.  In such a case, the IDIQ should be present at the final Deep Dive brief out at a minimum, and design guidelines should be established at that meeting. 

3.2.	Participate in Design Workshop.  If the option is not exercised, there will be a one-day charrette with the designer of record for the project at a future date to be agreed upon.  The strategic consultant will be responsible for briefing the charrette participants on the organizational issues and concepts/teams that developed from the assessment process.  The consultant will also participate in the development of design concepts and scenarios at the charrette to assure that the organizational intent is integrated into the thinking about the workplace design. 

Deliverable:  Written design Charrette Analyses of how well the design workshop direction addresses the concerns, issues and concepts developed in the Deep Dive brief.  This report should be released no later than five working days after the Design Charrette. 

3.3.	Participation in design Development.  The strategic consultant will participate along with the Workplace 30.30 core team, in periodic review of the workplace design as it develops.  The consultant’s role will be to assure that the new workplace meets the organizational business goals and objectives; where conflicts or retreat from goals is apparent, the strategic consultant will provide input to the client and design team regarding the potential impact on organizational goals. 

Deliverable:  Written comments after each review.  (Minimum of two reviews). 

3.4.	Participation in Meetings.  The Contractor is to participate in up to three meetings with other Contractors for the purposes of discussing findings and lessons learned during the course of the Deep Dive work.  The Contractor will participate in the development of a joint GSA tool set.   It is anticipated that these meetings will last for a day and a half and that they may be in San Francisco, California or in Washington, DC.  The Contractor should include the various possible prices for travel based on each of these two different locations.

3.5.	Participation in Tool Development.  The Contractor shall participate in the development and documentation of the tools and techniques that will be used in the Deep Dive, not just for this contract, but also in future engagements between GSA and its customers (other entities on the federal government).  If any tools proposed represent intellectual capital or have other protections, such as copyrights, the Contractor shall propose a license agreement for GSA for such tools.  It is the government’s intent that the Deep Dive be a process that is repeatable, consistently, regardless of the practitioner performing the work.  This license proposal need not be included in the Contractor’s response to this Statement of Work; however, such tools must be identified in the proposal. 

3.6.	Change Management Services.  At an appropriate time, determined by all parties, plan and assist the Agency in the implementation of a change management plan including: Focus group, Web communication, town hall meetings; Executive meetings and other means (as defined by the contractor and accepted by GSA).

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Ref:	(a) FAR 13.106-1

1.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-3 the justification for limited competition is supported by the following facts and rationale:

Caterpillar is the original equipment manufacturer of the engine; the parts required to overhaul this engine are not interchangeable with other brands of engines.  Approximately 140 different parts are required to overhaul this engine; these parts are identified on Defense Supply Center Columbus drawing number 2815NR0276.   

3. The combined synopsis/solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps with the intent to solicit quotes only from Caterpillar dealers with unique capabilities to satisfy the Coast Guard's requirement. Quotes will be solicited only from Caterpillar dealers as they are the only vendors that are able to provide Caterpillar parts and warranty.

<DESC>Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) Health Insurance Program: Introduction: Peace Corps is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified prospective vendors to provide Post-Service Health Insurance coverage for Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs), similar what is available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Temporary Continuation of Coverage (FEHB/TCC – 5 U.S.C. 8905a). Statement of Work: All RPCVs shall be enrolled at end of their Peace Corps service, regardless of length of service. Peace Corps will pay the first month’s premium for the RPCV and eligible dependent children under age 18. Background: All Peace Corps Volunteers undergo extensive  medical screening prior to service. Conditions determined to be traceable to their Peace Corps service, as well as pre-existing conditions determined to be aggravated, accelerated or precipitated by service, are covered under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA). While outside the United States, all Peace Corps Volunteers are considered “employed” 24 hours a day, 7 days per week for the purpose of access to FECA benefits. All conditions determined to be service-related by the Department of Labor, with or without associated disability, are eligible for FECA benefits as the primary payer. Within the first 180 days after service, Peace Corps pays for evaluation of any medical conditions which are unresolved at the Volunteer’s end of service. At the end of his or her service, each Volunteer receives a physical examination or receives an authorization for payment for a physical examination. Approximately 3,500 Volunteers close service annually; ongoing enrollment in the existing RPCV Post-Service Health Insurance Plan is approximately 7,000. Age distribution of Volunteers and Trainees: 20-29: 5512; 30-39: 592; 40-49: 151; 50-59: 235; 60-65: 104; Over 65: 84. Gender Distribution: Male: 2619; Female: 4059. (As reported as of 01 OCT 2002). Minimum Requirements of the RPCV Post-Service Health Insurance Program: 1. Major medical up to $1,000,000. 2. No pre-existing condition exclusions or restrictions for conditions that emerge during Peace Corps service. A wait time may be acceptable for non-acute, non-debilitating conditions that  pre-date entry into Peace Corps service. 3. Mental Health Parity Act compliant. 4. No increase in premiums or deductibles and no change in coverage for the first year of performance of the contract. 5. The contract is to be a one year Base Period with four one year Option Periods (FAR 52.217-9: 60 days notice prior to execution of option; anticipated duration is 60 months or Five years total). 6. Changes in costs, coverage and terms must be proposed for the option periods and will be evaluated. 7. Coverage is to be available for 18 months after service. 8. Guaranteed issuance to all eligible Volunteers, spouses and minor dependents, effective midnight on the date the Volunteer ends his or her service. 9. Provides coverage worldwide, including all 50 states. 10. Provides emergency medical evacuation to the United States or the closest adequate facility. 11. Premiums, deductibles and co-payments that meet or exceed the benefits requirements of a FEHB/TCC plan. 12. Program ensures that eligibility and portability are consistent with all provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 13. Subrogation: Insurance plan is a primary payer of benefits. However, upon any recovery made by a participant from any third party or parties whether by suit, judgment, settlement, compromise or otherwise, the plan shall be entitled to reimbursement to the extent of benefits paid (for example, by FECA). 14. Administration of the RPCV Post-Service Health Insurance Program: The program shall impose minimum administrative burden upon Peace Corps. As this is essentially a commercial product offered to private citizens, vendors are expected to provide for administrative support, marketing, documentation and general management of the program. Peace Corps strives to achieve effective transitional health benefits for former Volunteers. Peace Corps will pay the premium for the initial 30 days of coverage for all RPCVs (including those who do not elect to continue their insurance coverage at their own expense thereafter); all subsequent premiums must be elected and paid by the individual RPCV. The prospective vendor shall emphasize simplicity in management with respect to eligibility, enrollment, financial transactions between Peace Corps and the insurer and claims processing. The prospective vendor shall work with Peace Corps to implement and administer the RPCV Health Insurance Program. There will be no printed version of this RFP.  The latest versions of the following FAR section 52 series of clauses are hereby incorporated by reference and are available at “www.arnet.gov/far/farqueryframe.html”: 52.202-1 Definitions; 52.203-3 Gratuities; 52.203-5 Covenant Against Contingent Fees; 52.203-7 Anti-Kickback Procedures; 52.203-12 Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions; 52.204 Administrative Matters – Provisions & Clauses; 52.209-6 Protecting the Government’s Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment; 52.215 Contracting by Negotiation – Provisions & Clauses; 52.215-2 Audit & Records – Negotiation; 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns; 52.222 Application of Labor Laws to Government Acquisitions – Provisions & Clauses; 52.222-1 Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes; 52.222-3 Convict Labor; 52.222-4 Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act – Overtime Compensation; 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity; 52.222-29 Notification of Visa Denial; 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.223-6 Drug-Free Workplace; 52.224-2 Privacy Act; 52.227-1 Authorization and Consent; 52.227-2 Notice and Assistance Regarding Patent and Copyright Infringement; 52.229-3 Federal, State, and Local Taxes; 52.229-5 Taxes – Contracts Performed in U.S. Possessions or Puerto Rico; 52.229-6 Taxes – Foreign Fixed-Price Contracts; 52.230-2 Cost Accounting Standards; 52.230-3 Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices; 52.230-6 Administration of Cost Account Standards; 52.232 Contract Financing – Provisions & Clauses; 52.232-8 Discount for Prompt Payment; 52.232-17 Interest; 52.232-23 Assignment of Claims; 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer – Central Contractor Registration; 52.233-1 Disputes; 52.242-13 Bankruptcy; 52.243 Contract Modifications – Provisions & Clauses; 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property (Short Form); 52.246-4 Inspection of Services – Fixed Price; 52.247-63 Preference for U.S.-Flag Air Carriers; 52.249 Termination of Contracts – Provisions & Clauses; 52.249-2 Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed Price); 52.249-8 Default (Fixed Price Supply and Service); 52.252 Solicitation Provisions & Contract Clauses; 52.252-6 Authorized Deviations in Clauses.

Pass and Registration will annotate, in block # 17 of the USAFE Form 79, the results of the LAC.  Personnel who return with a LAC containing derogatory information may be declined base access. Further information will be required before a base pass will be issued. A determination will be made at the time of request on whether further information is required to issue a base pass. Pass and Registration will maintain a copy of the LAC on file, for the duration of employment of the individual.  Agencies are required to notify Pass and Registration of any new derogatory information received after the LAC has been completed.

found in the employee's medical folder. All assessment and dispositions shall be documented on AF Form 2770 and accompanying documentation provided by the Civilian Personnel Office/DPCE, (SF 513).

4.9 The contractor shall verify physical examination findings through verification of the original tests or additional testing as prescribed by the attending contract physician, after telephone coordination with the 94th ASTS/POC in the annual physicals, or the Civilian Personnel Office, in the case of pre-employment or fitness-for-duty physical. The case shall be pursued until it can be conclusively determined as an individual is/is not at an
increased risk of health impairment from occupational exposure or is/is not physically able to perform their job.

4.10 An individual may be recommended for temporary removal from his/her work area or recommended limitations from specific working conditions or exposures until the specific nature of their medical condition can be determined through verification or additional testing. The contractor shall verbally notify the DPCE Representative
immediately at 421-5036, but no later than one workday after the determination that limiting condition exists or that removal from the work area is recommended. Written notification will be provided via AF Form 2770 or SF 513, in the case of a fitness-for-duty physical.

4.11 The Medical Review Officer shall provide services review for the results of approximately 15 drug tests per quarter. Specimen will be routinely tested for cannibalis and cocaine and may also be tested for amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine when appropriate. The MRO shall provide services as follows:

4.11.1 Upon receipt of a positive test, contractor shall make an appointment through the individual's supervisor if possible or employee to discuss test results with the individual to provide the specimen to determine if there was an alternate valid medical records or other medical documentation made available by the employee to support the
assertion of legitimate drug use. Verification can be made without interview if the employee declines the opportunity for an interview.

4.11.2 Conduct a limited physical examination to determine if there is clinical evidence (e.g. needle track marks) of illegal drug use in cases where a urine specimen is positive.

4.11.3 Make determination of a negative test results if a legal use of an appropriate drug is established or if the MRO concludes the result is scientifically insufficient or not in accordance with the Department of Human Services guidelines.

<DESC>Heavy weight Deflectometer with spares kit, tool kit, spare deflectors and spare deflector holder, survey grade GPS capability, video system for load transfer testing, hinged trailer, and trailer mounted generator system that meets technical specification as outlined below:

PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS	 
HEAVY WEIGHT DEFLECTOMETER
PAVEMENT DEFLECTION TEST DEVICE

1.0 GENERAL   QTY: 1 EA

1.1 This specification applies to a device used for the determination of pavement deflections as a result of applying an impulse load to the pavement surface. The resulting deflections, measured at the center of the applied load and at distances away from the load, are used to determine the material properties of the pavement layers and measure deflection transfer across joints in portland cement concrete pavements. Data are used to structurally evaluate the load-carrying capacity and overlay thickness requirements for highway and airfield pavements.

2.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION

2.1 General. The device shall impart a force pulse generated by a weight dropped on a buffer system that is transmitted through a circular plate resting on the pavement surface. The pavement loading device shall be a trailer mounted Heavy Weight Deflectometer (HWD). The unit shall be of durable construction and be stable when towed at highway speeds on normal roads. The tow vehicle is excluded from this specification. The producer of this device must have demonstrated proven production experience of a device of this type. A reference list with complete names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least five (5) different active owners/agencies residing in the united States who purchased directly from the manufacturer and who own the same model of the manufacturer's equipment, including their relevant representative and with at least three (3) having the identical base equipment,
shall be provided by the manufacturer to ascertain quality assurance, and to indicate the capacity of the manufacturer to deliver and support equipment exactly to these similar specifications. The manufacturer of the device shall have a full parts inventory and established service network, including a well established record of equipment support in the United States, verifiable through the above reference list.

2.1.1 The following operations will be preprogrammed and performed automatically from controls located within the towing vehicle. The plate and deflection sensors will be lowered to the pavement. The weight shall be raised to the height that, when dropped, will impact the desired force to the pavement. The weight shall be dropped and the resulting vertical movement or deflection of the pavement surface shall be measured with instrumentation described below. The apparatus shall then be raised for movement to the next test site.

2.1.2 The peak deflection of the pavement at each measuring location resulting from the first force pulse will be recorded in mils (0.001 inch).

2.1.3 The peak force imparted by the falling weight will be measured and recorded as pounds force (lbf).

2.2 General Requirements for Measuring System. The instrumentation system shall conform to the following overall requirements which shall be tested and approved prior to delivery:
2.2.1 Instrumentation that is exposed to the elements (outside the vehicle) shall be suitable and operable in the temperature range of 10 to 120 degrees F (-12 to 49 degrees C) as a minimum.
2.2.2 Instrumentation that is not exposed (i.e., inside the tow vehicle) shall be suitable and operable in the temperature range of 40 to 105 degrees F (5 to 40 degrees C) as a minimum.

2.2.3 The exposed portions of the system shall tolerate relatively high humidity as well as rain or spray and all other adverse conditions such as dust, shock, and vibrations that may be normally encountered.

2.2.4 The system shall have an independent power generation system mounted on the trailer allowing the unit to operate independent of any external power source. 

2.3 FORCE-GENERATED DEVICE

2.3.1 The force generating device (i.e., the falling weight) shall be capable of being raised to anyone of four operator preselected adjustable heights and dropped. A preprogrammed test will consist of at least eight drops at any combination of the four heights. The resulting force pulse transmitted to the pavement should be reproducible. The force pulse shall approximate the shape of a haversine or half sine.  The force pulse duration should be in the range of 20 to 60 milliseconds or the "rise time" in the range of 10 to 25 milliseconds. Peak force range will be from 7,000 lb force to 52,500 lb force. The maximum force output will be at least 52,000 lb.

2.3.2 The guide system shall be designed to operate with negligible friction or resistance and shall also be designed so that the weight falls perpendicular to the pavement surface. The loading plate shall be swivel-suspended to allow for a tilt in any direction of 5 degrees minimum from the horizontal plane.

2.3.3 The pavement loading device shall be equipped with a hand pump so that the loading plate/falling weight/deflection transducer bar subassembly may be raised for removal of the equipment from the place of use in an emergency or if the electro-hydraulic system fails.

2.3.4 All metal parts on the pavement loading device, including electric and hydraulic lines, shall be corrosion resistant by either being plated to provide galvanic protection or painted with primer and then enamel.

2.4 Loading Plates. The loading plate used to transmit the applied force of the pavement shall be capable of approximating a uniform distribution of the load on the pavement surface. Loading plates will be furnished that are 300 mm (12 in) and 450 mm (18 in) in diameter. The plates shall be open in the center to allow a deflection measuring sensor to be installed.

2.5 SYSTEM CONTROL AND DATA HANDLING

2.5.1 The system shall include all necessary software to conduct full operation from the keyboard of a microcomputer. Appropriate software shall be provided for checking and editing of field data. The software shall be fully compatible with IBM-PC computers.

2.5.2 Data Processing and Storage. The measured deflection data and supporting information, including pavement surface temperature, distance, date/time and identification data for each test point, shall be displayed on the computer screen and can be stored on magnetic storage device or a paper strip or both if selected by the operator.

2.5.3 The System Software shall be able to run in a Simulator Mode (with or without having the pavement loading device connected), being able to simulate all System functions, making it usable for detailed operation training/demonstration on the System microcomputer or on any other compatible PC.

2.6 INSTRUMENTATION

2.6.1 Deflection Transducers. Velocity transducers used to
measure the deflection shall be of such design as to measure the vertical movement of the pavement. A minimum of seven velocity transducers shall be used for deflection measurements. One transducer shall be mounted through a hole in the center of the load plate and shall rest on the pavement surface for measurement of deflection at the center of the applied load. The other transducers shall be mounted in a continuous line extending in one radial direction from the loading plate and in line with the center of the trailer and beneath the trailer. These six transducers shall be adjustable to any desired spacing to distance of at least 8 feet from the center of the loading plate. The transducers shall be mounted in such a manner as to minimize angular rotation with respect to its measuring plane at the maximum expected movement. The transducers shall be shock resistant to accelerations experienced during normal transportation over paved and unpaved road ways and water proof to a five foot depth of water. Linear voltage differential transformers are not acceptable substitutes for the velocity transducers.

2.6.2 A load cell shall be used to measure the applied load on each impact. It shall be placed in a position to minimize inertial effects. The load cell design shall permit deflection measurements at the center of the load plate. The load cell shall be resistant to the mechanical shocks from road impacts, and shall be water proof to a five foot depth of water.

2.6.3 A trigger device shall be furnished which activates the sensing equipment immediately prior to initial impact of the falling weights in order to insure proper registration of the actual quantities of load and deflection. If any error is present or forthcoming in these values during testing, such an error shall be detectable from either the computer display prior to release of the weights or from the data file (e.g., in the form of warning flags) subsequent to resting.

2.7 SIGNAL CONDITIONING AND RECORDER SYSTEM

2.7.1 The load measurements shall be accurate to at least +/- 2% or +/- 36 lbf, whichever is greater; and when recorded, the minimum resolution shall not be more than 16 lbf when using the 300-mmdiameter loading plate or not more than 36 Ibf when using the 450mm-diameter plate.

2.7.2 The deflection measurements shall be accurate to at least +/- 2% or +/- 0.10 mils, whichever is greater; and when recorded, the minimum resolution shall not be more than 0.05 mil. Deflection sensors shall be accurate to these tolerances and measure deflections to at least 80 mils.

2.7.3 The device, shall meet the load and deflection accuracy requirements as defined by the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) FWD absolute dynamic reference calibration and relative calibration verification procedures, and shall be capable of performing these procedures upon delivery if taken to a SHRP FWD calibration site.

2.7.4 The accuracy stability shall remain as specified regardless of the pavement materials upon which testing is carried out (eg, will not require electrical deflector gain or other physical modifications "recalibration" from one pavement type to another), nor will it be influenced by changes in the deflector distances from the center of the load within specifications shown.

2.8 Video System. A video system shall be provided for operator assistance in PCC joint testing and equipment operator monitoring. It shall include a multiple auto-focusing camera and high resolution monitor. In design it should be compact, weatherproof, and mounted for shock resistance.

2.9 Automated Surface Temperature unit. A temperature sensor shall be mounted on the trailer for measuring the pavement surface temperature. The temperature data shall be recorded automatically for each test location with deflection and force data.

2.10 Manuals. Two sets of commercial operations and maintenance manuals per item shall be furnished that include appropriate wiring diagrams and trouble shooting, setup, and calibration procedures.

2.11 Spare Parts. Spare parts shall be furnished to include one load cell, two deflection transducers, one deflection transducer holder, proximity sensors (one each of all types), pressure switches (one each of all types), and electronic relays (one replacement for each that is used).

2.12 Toolkit.  The contractor shall provide a tool kit with sufficient quantity, quality and type of tools to perform maintenance in the field of the deflectometer and trailer to include the ability to change loads cells, transducers (deflectors) and deflector holders 

2.13 Survey grade global positioning system.  The contractor shall provide a system that incorporates a survey grade global positioning system with the unit.  The GPS unit shall be incorporated such that output from the system can include deflection data as well as data from the GPS in the same file.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-04.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Alpha-Beta Sample Counter to be used in the Safety, Health and Environment Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***
 
***All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Alpha-Beta Sample Counter.  

The Alpha-Beta Sample Counter shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

1. The system shall consist of a sample detector, background guard detector, shielding, counter electronics, operating system, sample changer, user interface, a computer for systems parameters programming and data logging, printer, monitor, input devices (keyboard and mouse), connecting cables, uninterruptible power supply/power surge suppression, cart, detector gas controls, connections and tubing, sample planchets, and any other components needed for appropriate turn key operation. Software based operating systems are strongly preferred but firmware operating systems will be considered if it can be demonstrated or documented that they provide the acceptable protocol programming and output format flexibility, QA tracking, data storage, and data transfer capabilities, and provide a reliable and simple user friendly interface.

Detector Characteristics:
2. The system shall utilize ¡§ultra-thin windowed¡¨ gas flow proportional detector capable of detecting alpha and beta particles.   (Venders may optionally propose using solid state detectors.  If they do they must provide documentary evidence that they will meet the same or better performance, detection, and background suppression specifications that are available with gas flow detectors. They shall also provide similar documentary evidence of reliability, stability, reparability, and cost effectiveness).  
3. The system shall be capable of detecting 0.005 uCi of contamination from sources including C-14, S-35, Fe-59, Cl-36, Cs-137, Co-60, I-131, Am-241, and U-238,  Detection efficiencies (CPM/DPM) shall be at least 15 percent for C-14, 35 percent for Cl-36, 45 percent for Sr/Y-90, and 40 percent for Am-241.
4. The system shall be capable of meeting detection requirements while operating in external gamma radiation fields up to 0.5 mR/hr.   

5. Lead shielding as well as a separate background ¡§guard¡¨ detector and subtraction algorithm shall be utilized to achieve optimum counting statistics and to minimize sample count times for an established minimum detectable activity.  Backgrounds shall not exceed 2 CPM beta or 0.2 CPM alpha while operating in typical background fields of 20 uR/hr

6. Changes in background (guard detector) count rates shall be apparent through an on screen display of the guard counts or by an automated signal from the system.

7. Spillover of the beta channel signal into the alpha channel shall be less than or equal to 1%.

8. Samples with count rates up to 500,000 cpm shall be measurable with less than 2% dead time loss.

9. The active diameter of the detector shall be „d 2 inches to provide approximately 2 pi coverage of the sample trays


Flow Control:
10. If a gas flow based detector is proposed, the counter shall use a standard P-10 counting gas.  Gas flow shall be monitored and controlled by the system and designed to minimize gas flow during times of inactivity and purge the chamber following a shut off.  The detector voltage shall power down automatically with a signal of low flow to prevent damage to the detector and prevent operation that could report erroneous measurement results.  A low flow indication shall be displayed visually and/or audible either via the controlling computer or the instrument.
 Physical Considerations:
11. The system shall meet performance requirements for normal laboratory environmental conditions with room temperature 15 - 32 degrees C, and relative humidity 20 - 70 percent.

12. The system shall operate on standard AC power at 115 to 125 Volts at 60 Hz.    

13. The instrument shall be self contained and semi portable.  The system shall be fully incorporated onto its own wheeled cart.  The entire counting system (including computers and output devices but not necessarily the gas bottle) shall be capable of being moved by one individual, without disassembly or technical support from the manufacturer.

14. The system shall be designed for ease of maintenance and repair.  The counting chamber and detectors shall be capable of being removed, cleaned, or replaced by NIST personnel without undue difficulty or use of specialized tools unless such tools are provided.  The detector window shall be removable for cleaning or replacement by NIST staff in the event of damage or contamination.  A replacement window shall be included with the counter system. 

15. The sample changer shall be automatic with the capability of handling at least 50 pre-loaded samples.  Each sample holder shall be sized to handle sample holders, i.e. planchettes, of 2 inches in diameter by 1/4 inch tall and shall be individually identified or coded for use in the counting system. The sample holders shall be removable, washable and replaceable without affecting the system operation.  It shall be permissible to use sample holders in any combination or sequence order.  The changer mechanism shall require minimal preventive maintenance requirements and having an expected operating life of at least ten years without major service or component replacement.  The time required to change samples and initiate the next count shall be less than 20 seconds. 

16. Control of loading, manual sample advance, reverse, or restack, start count sequence, stop count, and unloading shall be possible from a top panel touch pad, keyboard, or mouse ergonomically placed close to the sample planchets for quick loading and unloading.  The unit should also have a flat shelf space to place the smears during loading and unloading.

System Control Algorithms: 
17. Full setup and QA of the counter, input and monitoring of system parameters, gas flow control, protocol programming, sample handling commands, output templates, and data file storage shall be possible via the computer linked interface.  

18.  The interface computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and printer shall be supplied with the counter. The vendor shall also supply all required software along with backup disks of the programs for reinstallation or for installation on a replacement computer with an off the shelf unit if necessary.  (A list of all proprietary computer boards, system requirements, current costs, and replacement lead times shall be included with the documentation).

19. It shall be possible to have multiple protocols in the sample stack to allow multiple users to set up their samples and leave the system to run and automatically provide the output without further intervention. 

20. Sample count times shall be program/protocol adjustable from 0.1 to 1000 minutes.  

21. The program shall allow for repeat or sequential counting to track decay or test system stability (Chi squared tests).

22. The system shall be fully integrated with customizable programming for at least ten different sample protocols which will be selected via a sample stack loaded card.  The user and/or system manager shall be able to customize counting and sample parameters such as count time, repeat counts, efficiencies, background subtraction levels, and data output formats.

23. Protocol programming shall support simple mathematical algebraic operations to convert data output to user specified values or units. These simple operations shall include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, log, and square root functions allowing background subtraction, efficiency and unit conversions, decay corrections, and statistical analysis.  The protocol programming shall also allow for input specification of flow rates, deposition rates, or volumes for calculations when counting particulate air filters.    

24. Protocol specified output reports formats shall support units such as gross and net counts and count rates, disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute, disintegrations per second, multiples of Becquerel (Bq, kBq, etc.) and multiples of Curies, (nCi, uCi, etc).  Outputs shall be capable of reporting at a minimum: Protocol Titles, Sample Identifications, User Identifications, Dates, Clock Time, Count Rates, Disintegration Rates, Sample Count Times, Minimal Detectable Activities, and Standard Deviations, and ¡§Alarm¡¨ or ¡§Contaminated¡¨ warnings. The ¡§Alarm¡¨ or ¡§Contaminated¡¨ warnings shall be based on user specified levels appropriately programmed for each protocol.  

25. The report output templates shall be user customizable.  Programming these templates shall be menu driven with on screen help and full instructions shall be provided with the documentation.  Customizing the reports shall be simple without requiring extensive programming knowledge. Output report templates shall include optional space for comments, sample descriptions, and signature blocks. Printout formats shall be capable of reporting results for at least 25 samples per page.

26. Users shall have the option or ability to input a description, user name, or other pertinent input data such as sample descriptions that will be included in the reports at the beginning of a batch counting.  Should the user choose not to input that data before counting, the report formats shall be able to include blank lines to add the information to the file after the count and to hand write this information on the hard copy print out.  

27. Real time on screen display of sample data, counting session results, system parameters, and specified analysis shall also be supported while the count is in progress.  For example when the 1st sample is completed the screen shall echo the calculated report results to the screen.  An update of the second count or count rate and count time will also be displayed either on the monitor or a separate display panel on the unit while the count is in progress.  When the second sample count is done, the monitor shall display those calculated report results below the first sample results and shall proceed to the third sample, etc.  In this way the user shall be able to track the results for the batch while the counting is in progress. 

28. Automatic hard copy report print outs for each batch of samples shall be available in all operating modes. For example it shall be possible to set the protocol for normal sample counting so that the report shall be printed automatically upon completion of the counts without requiring the user to return to the machine, select a file, then command a print.  The user shall be able to start the count, walk away, comeback later, and take the printout off the printer tray.  

29. Counting session results shall also be saved in memory so that the data can later be retrieved to generate an additional hard copy report output at a later time.   The software shall support saving the sample count results to an electronic media such as disks, CD RW, or other standard and supportable computer data transfer media.  The data files shall be retrievable, transferable, and editable as needed using common database or spread sheet software (This soft ware shall also be supplied and loaded onto the computer).  The system shall indicate when the disk memory is nearing capacity to allow the users to remove files without loss of data.

30. All operating parameters for each of the sample types (protocols)  shall be stored and available for use at any time during counting of samples with sample type identified by a built-in designed method (such as protocol cards).  A function to back up and recall all system parameters, user created/defined controls, output formats, collected data, and analysis results to removable media shall be provided either within the program or external to the program.

31. The system shall be designed to automatically recover from any power interruption and continue operations without loss of operating parameters or completed count data.  

32. Separate modes for alpha and alpha+beta measurements shall be provided and be selectable from the sample protocol batch programs.

33. Quality assurance and Quality Control shall be integrated features of the software.  The software shall include automated routines for comprehensive calibration and quality assurance determination and adjustment of all sensitive parameters.  These will include voltage plateau, threshold, and window settings, detection efficiency, detector background count rates, alpha and beta channel spillover, and efficiency/background figure of merit or similar optimization measures. Quality control parameters (back ground, Chi-squared stability, long term alpha and beta source response stability, energy efficiency, alpha window cross over, and LLD or MDA) shall be monitored and trend plots should be generated automatically and/or at the users request.  Indications of statistical deviations from set parameters shall be identified by the QC software.

<DESC>AMENDMENT #1 The purpose of this amendment is twofold: (1)	To amend the solicitation to read “This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-05.”  (2)	And to add an addendum to the Government’s Statement of Work. Statement of Work Addendum We performed an extensive review of our system and interfaces and have created a list of requirements that must be satisfied by the selected vendor. These capabilities must be exhibited by the vendor selected to fulfill requirements for information access, retrieval, and reporting from Honeywell systems.  1.	Solution must process Honeywell files and databases including BCD, ASCII, UFAS, DDE, and IDSII. 2.	Solution must operate without modification on any release of the Honeywell GCOS8 operating system. Therefore, in the process of migrating from one level of GCOS to another, there is no conversion activity or maintenance activity associated with the continued use of the selected solution. 3.	Solution must provide automatic navigation through the IDSII database for data extracts, reports, and queries. 4.	Solution must provide automatic creation and maintenance of the typical `data dictionary'. 5.	Solution must prohibit update of files or database structures, thus precluding accidental or deliberate data contamination. 6.	Solution must provide for dynamically merging data from disjoint files and databases without sacrificing other important features like automatic database navigation. 7.	Solution must processes the actual data as it exists on the system rather than requiring a duplicate of the data on a separate system. 8.	Solution must provide a performance improvement for extracting data from the Honeywell systems in the range of 5 top 10 times faster than the current COBOL processes. 9.	Solution must provide at a minimum the file output formats of UFAS, SSF, and delimited. 10.	Solution must provide processing in both BATCH and TSS. 11.	Solution must provide an integrated solution to access the Honeywell IDSII data directly from a commercial off the shelf, SQL language end user query tool.

2. The Convertamatic 26D comes with AXP a detergent dispensing system and gel batteries. Although these items were not in my original request, it would be highly effective to take advantage of what they have to offer from a cost saving aspect. The AXP detergent dispensing system will eliminate wasting any unused water detergent mixture saving money over the long term (any stagnant water should be drained; stagnant water needs to be kept to a minimum to help minimize the risk of a break-out of the west Nile virus as well as for overall health concerns). The 4-180 AH gel batteries provide a longer work life which will facilitate duration of use in building 160 (the B-2 hanger), have a longer service life (saving costly replacement) and require no servicing. Saving time by eliminating battery servicing and inspections.

<DESC>The synopsis is amended to answer questions from potential offerors.  The questions and answers are as follows:

1. Regarding the break out panels, the Elephant Trunk Protector on the outside is unclear.  Is this just a rubber flap that hangs down?  How does it fasten?
 
The elephant trunk is a sleeve made of two layers of a canvas type material.  The inner layer is metalized, the outer layer is black.  The trunk is held in place by a frame to the outside wall of another frame which has been welded to the trailer.  A sealing gasket may also be needed under the frame.  The bottom end of the elephant trunk has a draw string to narrow the opening.

     2.   Regarding the break out panels, in the lower part of the cross section you show three vertical lines/objects.  What is the middle line/object, and the small rectangular item to the right? 

From the left to the right, the partial figure refers to the following: the first line represents the container wall which terminates under the square box. The square box is part of the frame that encompasses the whole opening to form the frame for securing the elephant trunk. The second line(s) represents the bottom section of the elephant trunk as it emerges from the bottom of the frame. The third line(s) represents the top section 
of the elephant trunk as it emerges from the top of the frame.

3.	Regarding the array trailer structural modification, the 10' end modification is unclear. I assume it to be a 12 gauge steel extension.  Is the rectangular box on the diagram a window?

The 10' extension can be made of 12 gauge material if it is properly braced so that one or two men can walk on it without deflection.  10 or 11 gauge material is preferred with less bracing, however, some stiffening will be needed no matter how it is made.  The rectangular box is a window.

    4.   Regarding the array trailer structural modification, does it penetrate the container end wall or is it just a big steel weldment that hangs on the end wall?  What is the thickness of this steel?

           The structural modification replaces the wall.  The thickness depends on the design of the bracing, which is discussed in the previous question.

<DESC>Amendment 1 - 

This synopsis/solicitation is amended to change the North Americal Industry Classification code to 334512, and the business size standard to 500 employees. 

The due date for proposals is extended to September 9, 2005 at 1PM EDT.


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50136-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-05.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Information Systems and Computer Services (ISCS) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to have all ISCS owned environmental systems monitored for events in real-time.  The North American Industry Classification code is 238210, and the business size standard is $12M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction: 
ISCS is responsible for providing user support, application development, network connectivity, and file/print services to the more than 7,000 users conducting research activities. In order to provide these services ISCS maintains data centers both on and off NIH campus locations. The centers allow a secure and environmentally controlled location to house the required network and computing systems. Without these centers cancer research would be greatly impacted.

Background:  
ISCS personnel have been required to monitor the HVAC systems currently in use in NCI data centers. ISCS personnel only know when a failure has occurred when the temperature probe indicates an increase in temperature. This has proven to be inefficient and it has been determined that a new system is required to provide real-time data of the units providing cooling. 

Statement of Work:

Specific Objectives of this Procurement: ISCS specific objectives are to: 1) Have all HVAC systems monitored 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week, 2) Dispatch the appropriate resource to correct reported HVAC failures, 3) Provide monthly reports concerning the systems being monitored to include temperature history, alarms reported, and service personnel dispatched.

Contractor Requirements
1.  Connect monitoring devices to the following HVAC units:

Question: In the RFQ the Army states that this equipment must interface with the existing systems.  Do you have a specification for the other system interfaces?  Answer: The statement, must interface with the existing systems, pertains to the test sets interface with the SINGARS Radio Sets. Question: How should the quote look- as simple as a single page?   Answer: The format of the quote is up to you, the document does need to contain the items requested in the combined solicitation synopsis document, most companies just submit a quote on their company letterhead and it can be one page.   Question: Necessary details it should contain - does the government need my cost and markup or just one final figure for each item?   Answer: One final figure for each item. Question: Given that there is significant lead times for these items and the manufacturers require funding up front; is the government willing/able to pay up-front how is that addressed in quote? or does the contractor, me, have to front the funds and get reimbursed after delivery?   Answer: The government can only pay for something after delivery and acceptance. Question: What is the average markup and what are the expected markups on equipment?  Answer: Upon clarification the questioner was referring to overhead and profit. The amount of markup put on something is up to the company to decide taking into account the evaluation factors of the procurement.   Question: We see that the RFQ response date has moved from Aug 29, 2005 to September 12, 2005.  Can you tell me the reason for the extension on the RFQ?  Answer: The Government was contacted and asked for an extension, the end user agreed.
