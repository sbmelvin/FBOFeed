<DESC>This effort is for engineering and inspection services for the continuation of an eighteen (18) year Pressure and Hazardous Material System (PHMS) certification program, an on-going effort to produce AEDC maintainable drawing schematics that accurately reflect the field installation of selected AEDC systems, completing the ultra-sonic inspection of 13 above ground oil-water separator storage tanks and the conduct of related engineering studies for the United States Air Force, Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB TN.  This effort also includes a start-up effort to certify the PHMS at AEDC facilities located at White Oak MD.  Certification is a multi-step process that includes field verification, engineering analysis, non-destructive examination, deficiency correction monitoring, as-built documentation review and in-service inspection planning.  Systems or subsystems are to be certified for continued safe operations under customer performance criteria with minimal impact to the AEDC test mission.  AEDC test systems range in age from new to over fifty (50) years old.  The White Oak systems are over thirty (30) years old.   

 To date, approximately 161 of the 252 certification projects at Arnold AFB have been completed.  Approximately 54 of the 252 certification projects are in various phases of completion.  The AEDC White Oak MD facility has identified eight (8) new projects for PHMS certification.

AEDC anticipates negotiating a one year cost-plus-award-fee contract with eight one-year options.  To be considered for award, the offeror must clearly demonstrate that it will provide a staff with appropriate management and technical skills to accomplish assigned certifications in the area of PHMS.  Significant evaluation factors will be (1) mission capability with emphasis on technical approach in compliance with the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Statement of Work, (2) relevant past and present performance and (3) cost.   

A  RFP will be posted on or about 9 April 07 with proposals due 30-days after the RFP is posted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Analytical Chemistry Division, Nuclear Methods Team performs gamma spectrometry and neutron activation analysis (NAA) for a variety of applications. 

NAA is a nuclear analytical method of determining the element composition of samples. An integrated hardware and software system is used to collect data, reduce data and perform the calculations necessary to produce final results by this technique. 

The system that NIST currently has consists of 20 gamma-ray detectors with associated hardware, all of which are interfaced with VMS-based minicomputers.  This system must be replaced because the VMS operating system is not compliant with NIST Information Technology (IT) security requirements and because the VMS-based system is no longer supported by the original vendor (Nuclear Data/Canberra).

This acquisition will provide the hardware and software needed to move several of the detection systems from the current VMS-based data acquisition software to PC-based data acquisition software AND to provide new PC-based NAA software that will perform calculations on all spectral data acquired on the new and existing systems. The requested hardware/software system must be integrated for the acquisition and calculation of newly acquired data AND the software must work with data acquired on legacy systems that use the Canberra Industries CAM (*cnf) and Ortec ADCAM (*.chn)CAM spectral data format types. 

This hardware and software, which is classified as commercial, will be competed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, via full & open competition. 

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 
500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-07-RQ-0255.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 15, 2007, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<SUBJECT>--Wall mounted Chemscan Model UV-2150/S and wall mounted Chemscan electrical interface enclosure.
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Kershner Environmental Technologiies, LLC of Annapolis, MD.  The manufacturer, Applied Spectrometry Assoicates, I nc. of Waukesha, WI has identified Kershner Environmental Technologies, LLC as the local Washington, DC representative for the purchase of 2 (two) each wall mounted Chemscan Model UV-2150/S and 2 ea wall mounted Chemscan electrical interface enclosure.  Th e instrument is capable of analyzing trace levels of free ammonia in drinking water, on a continuous basis, for water treatment process control by the Plant Operations Branch of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Aqueduct Divsion, Washington, DC.  Th e addition of treatment chemicals for disinfection must be carefully controlled to maintain a specific ratio of chlorine to ammonia.  This is accomplished by ensuring that a detectable, but very low, free ammonia residual exists at all times in the treated  water.  Grab sampling cannot be done frquently enough to detect fee ammonia level excursions; therefore, an online instrument is necessary.  There are two known intruments on the market that claim to be capable of low level online free ammonia detection.  1.  Hach APA 6000 Ammonia and Monochloramine Analyzer and 2.  ChemScan Model UV-2150/S Chloramination Analyzer.  Both instruments were tested on trail basis at the treatment facilities.  Instrument readings were compared with parallel laboratory analyses.   ChemScan Model 250/S performed acceptably while the Hach did not.  In addition to meeting the analytical performance requirements, the ChemScan Model 2150/S required significantly less routine maintenance and was capable of operating with less expensive,  generic reagents.  Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The determination to not compete the proposed acquisition is within the discretion o f the Government.  No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intenet is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by June 22, 2007 will be considered by the Government.
