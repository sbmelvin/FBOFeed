<CONTACT>Cynthia Y. Mitchell, Phone 412-386-6434, Email akq9@cdc.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to ViAcoustics.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a the purchase of modifications and updates to the Audiometric Research Tool (ART) software used for hearing testing in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), to include (1) reducing the configuration file burden by creating transducer and test protocol data files that contain the unique transducer settings and test setup parameters and integrating the selection of configuration files into ART; (2) developing a Words-In-Noise test module for the ART software; and (3) making minor software changes as requested based on feedback from field staff.</p>
<p><br />Purchase of this particular model from the specified vendor will allow continuation of software applications. The Audiometric Research Tool software application around which this project is based was originally developed by ViAcoustics for NIOSH. Using a similar system for field data collection makes it much easier for NIOSH researchers to monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot issues as they arise. Now that ART has been implemented in NHANES, it is more cost-effective to build additional software requirements into that software. This system is the only one that meets all of these requirements.</p>
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within seven (7) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist Cynthia Y. Mitchell at cmitchell@cdc.gov by 10:00 am on August 13, 2018.</p>

Deadline date for capability statements is 10 August 2018 at 1:00 PM Eastern Time. Questions concerning this notice will not be accepted. The projected award date is September 1, 2018. The period of performance is six months (September 1, 2018 - February 2019).</p>
<p>Statement of Work:</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW<br />The Office of Disease Prevention seeks to update our areas of focus, part of which stem from a 2004 paper on the risk factors that are causes of mortality in the U.S. Strategic Priority III of our strategic plan aims to promote the best use of available research methods and develop better methods. Expanding available, current, and comprehensive estimates of the burden of disease in the United States to allow for estimates of leading risk factors for premature mortality and morbidity is needed to facilitate enhanced prevention efforts. <br />1.1 BACKGROUND<br />Since the adoption of our first Strategic Plan, our Office's top areas of interest for prevention efforts are based on a 2004 analysis of risk factors that are thought to be responsible for the largest mortality burden in the U.S. We would like to leverage the largest and most comprehensive study on this topic in the world, The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), to update our areas of foci and track them through time. <br />Based at Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and involving more than 3,000 collaborators globally, the GBD is the world's largest systematic, scientific effort to quantify the magnitude of health loss from all diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geographic location over time. The GBD annually produces estimates of health outcomes for 333 diseases and injuries and 84 risk factors for each of 195 countries and territories, including subnational estimates for a selected set of countries (for a current total of 591 geographic locations, including the United States). As a part of the GBD enterprise, IHME has developed a comprehensive forecasting platform that is capable of producing year-by-year scenarios of key health outcomes for up to 25 years into the future. There is no data source as large or comprehensive or methodologically strong as this study in the world. To date, the GBD study has not developed an aggregate age category to enable examinations of premature mortality; death that occurs before a person reaches an expected age, in this case, before old age. <br />1.2 SCOPE<br />To more closely support ODP prevention foci, an understanding of drivers of premature morbidity and mortality within burden of disease measures are needed. The data we hope to gain from this project on leading causes and risk factors will support the development and implementation of our Office's strategic plan for FY19-23. <br />1.3 OBJECTIVES <br />Change the GBD database to increase the aggregate age groups for which estimates of burden of disease are available to more closely support ODP priority setting and receive reports of disease burden for this new age group for ODP use. <br />2.0 REQUIREMENTS<br />2.1 TASKS<br />We would like to have a single additional aggregated age group created (&lt;70) within the Global Burden of Disease Study which is managed by IHME.</p>
<p><br />List tasks in sequential order, methodology, specifications/performance requirements, standards, locations, travel, etc.</p>
<p><br />2.2 DELIVERABLES<br />The data from this age group would be provided to the ODP for the estimates of burden of disease (similar to the data presented for the US in JAMA 2018 but adding this aggregate age group). Data and summary reports will be delivered to ODP once before the end of the contract via email and annually thereafter at no additional charge. This age group will be incorporated into the next set of GBD results, GBD 2017, for which the first release is anticipated to be October 2018. IHME is hopeful that this age group will be available at the time of this first release, otherwise it will be available in updates shortly after. Results for the &lt;70 age group will be made available through standard mechanisms for GBD, including data visualizations, the GBD results tool (which allows users to create semi-custom downloadable files of GBD estimates), and in publications where applicable. Also, once this age group is created, it will be available in future GBD releases, at no extra cost to ODP, as it will become part of the on-going GBD infrastructure. Following the release of GBD 2017, the next anticipated release is expected to be GBD 2019 in Spring/Summer 2020, with annual releases thereafter. <br /><br />Include work products, acceptance criteria, etc.</p>
<p>2.3 SCHEDULE <br />Data will be delivered to ODP once before the end of the contract. Results for the &lt;70 age group will be made available through standard mechanisms for GBD, including data visualizations, the GBD results tool (which allows users to create semi-custom downloadable files of GBD estimates), and in publications where applicable, and annually thereafter at no additional charge. Period of performance is September 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019. Place of performance is IHME offices at University of Washington.</p>
<p>2.4 ASSUMPTIONS<br />- IHME will be in contact with ODP staff continuously as needed through the contract. IHME will schedule a monthly conference call with ODP staff to review the projects scope and milestones.<br />- The final deliverable will be delivered to ODP at least two weeks before the end of the contract to ensure adequate time for ODP review.<br />3.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY<br />None<br />4.0 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS<br />None.<br />Refer to - http://www.hhs.gov/asfr/ogapa/acquisition/policies/hspd12-contract-guide-102707.html</p>

The consultant will be reimbursed for travel to provide support at a Government site or other site as may be specified under the contract. Consultant shall provide supporting documentation and a detailed breakdown of incurred travel costs with each invoice. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIE or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIE Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIE if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 

52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items.
EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

All evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Submit detailed information for each evaluation factor.

<DESC><p>This is for informational purposes only. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, one (1) 5-position deck mosquito HV Genomics instrument from TTP LabTech Ltd in support of the CDC National Centers for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Influenza Division. This compact liquid handler is smaller than most liquid handling systems and includes programming demonstrated to cut next generation sequencing (NGS) library construction down to 1/8th reaction volumes which will save the influenza genomics team over 1000 dollars/ per (NGS) run. As the team runs nearly 200 NGS runs/per year the instrument will save us considerable monies in reagent costs. Currently, the Mosquito is the only one that has the ability to accurately pipette the reagents necessary to cut library construction costs in this manner. TTP Lab tech Ltd is the sole producer and distributor of the Mosquito HV genomics instrument. The procurement of this compact liquid handler will allow the CDC to maintain focus on efforts that protect and improve the health of all people and all communities by supporting effective state and local public health practice and systems to expand the government's capacity to achieve health protection goals in order to improve health for all Americans. <br />This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Acquisition Management System Policy § 3.2.1.2.1.  Interested parties are advised that: 
- This is a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals;
- The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses; and
- Any costs associated with your response are solely at the interested parties’ expense.   

2.  Description of the Required Services

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a regulatory entity within the Department of Transportation (DOT) whose mission is to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world. As an agency, FAA is continuously striving to reach the next level of safety, efficiency, environmental responsibility and global leadership in aviation. 

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, (Pub. L 92-463, 5 U.S.C. App. 2) gives federal agencies the authority to charter advisory committees (FACs).  FACS are provisional bodies designed to solicit opinions from a variety of experts and give federal officials and the public access to information and advice on a broad range of issues affecting federal policies and programs. They also provide the public with an opportunity to provide input in a forum that may form the basis for government decisions.

Under FACA, agencies may only create FACs when they are essential to the performance of a duty or responsibility conveyed upon the executive branch by law or Presidential Directive.  FACA outlines the process for chartering a FAC and limits the duration of a FAC to two years, unless the agency obtains reauthorization of the charter. 

In May of 2018, FAA completed the process of chartering two FACs; the Drone Advisory Committee (DAC) and the NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC).  

The FAA's Drone Advisory Committee is a broad-based, long-term advisory committee that provides the FAA with advice on key UAS integration issues by helping to identify challenges and prioritize improvements. The Committee helps to create broad support for an overall integration strategy and vision.  Membership will be comprised of CEO/COO-level executives from a cross-section of stakeholders representing the wide variety of UAS interests, including industry, research and academia, retail, and technology.

The FAA formed the NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC) to partner with industry stakeholders, set priorities, and deliver tangible benefits to industry and the National Airspace System (NAS). Led by airline executives and aviation community leaders who have a comprehensive understanding of shared challenges and opportunities, the NAC convenes three times per year, in public, so that deliberations and findings are fully visible to everyone. Because the NAC has a multi-faceted industry perspective, it can develop a common understanding of modernization capabilities and constraints. It seeks consensus on a broad range of topics, with an emphasis on the near and mid-term. The NAC also fosters a common understanding of success with joint performance objectives and development milestones. It focuses on the scope of implementation, such as prioritization criteria at national level, joint investment priorities, and the location and timing of capability implementation.

FAA requires contractor support to facilitate the activities of the FACs to ensure that they satisfy the requirements of FACA and achieve the desired outcome of obtaining expert advice and public input.  

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

4.  Attached is amendment 1 to SIR 693KA9-18-R-00018.  The amendment includes a revised SIR document, industry questions and answers and revised attachment L-1.  As a result of this amendment the SIR due date is extended to August 17, 2018. 

5.  Responses must be submitted via electronic mail (e-mail) to Contracting Officer Iann T. Washington, iann.washington@faa.gov by the date below.  Responses to this announcement must include the following: Name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail of a designated company point of contact.  Verbal inquiries will NOT be accepted.
  
6.  Submissions are due by 2:00 pm EDT on August 17, 2018.  The FAA will provide acknowledgment of receipt to each respondent via e-mail.

7.    All documents associated with the SIR have been uploaded.
