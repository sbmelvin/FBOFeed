<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a market survey/sources sought to determine if there are qualified small business sources that are capable of executing highly specialized services.   Reclamation requires a Contractor with specific expertise in the areas of paleoseismology, neotectonics, Quaternary geology, and engineering geology related to hazards from earthquakes, landslides, and nontectonic deformation.  The Government envisions that contractor qualifications will consist of the following:
The Consultant shall have the breadth and depth of knowledge from a combination of education (Ph.D. in geology or engineering geology); work, research, and teaching experience (at least 20 years experience that includes at least 50 projects); publications in peer-reviewed journals and books; publications of reports and maps by Federal and State geological agencies; and contract reports for numerous projects in the United States and other countries.  The Contractor shall have extensive knowledge and experience in paleoseismology or paleoearthquake chronology, neotectonics, Quaternary faulting (including deciphering the history of fault surface ruptures), tectonic geomorphology, tectonic and non-tectonic processes that deform Quaternary deposits (including landslides and salt deformation), and thermoluminescence and radiocarbon dating as used in seismic hazard evaluations.
	The Contractor shall have extensive knowledge and experience in the application of study findings and their consequences to earthquake hazards related to critical structures, such as dams.
	The Contractor shall have previous experience with Federal, State, and Local governments on studies related to hazard assessment, especially earthquake and landslide hazards.
	The Consultant shall be thoroughly familiar with the geologic history of Joes Valley and the surrounding area, particularly the issues evaluating Quaternary tectonic and nontectonic features in this region.
		The following experience is highly desirable:
	Knowledge and experience working with glacial and fluvial deposits and landforms in settings similar to those in Joes Valley;
	Knowledge and experience in structural geology, especially as related to earthquakes hazard assessment and tectonic and nontectonic processes;
 	Familiarity with interpreting subsurface geology from seismic and other data.
   The pending requirement will require some on-site survey work (2 trips) at the Joes Valley fault zone in central Utah.  Required on-site performance will transpire in May or June as site conditions merit.   Reports will be required for the site examinations.    
     THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This a market research tool used to determine if the pending requirement can be effectively issued as a 100% small business, set-aside.  Capability to commence with the requirement shortly after award is a consideration since spring conditions maximize site examination.  The estimated overall period of performance will 4 to 5 months based on date of award.   
If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from qualified small business concerns, the solicitation may be issued on an unrestricted basis without further notice.   Please submit all requested documentation listed below to Ann R. Manning, Contracting Officer, Bureau of Reclamation, PO Box 25007 (84-27810), Denver, CO  80225-0007.  The related e-mail address is amanning@usbr.gov,  and the phone number is (303) 445-2433.  
Interested parties should submit a capabilities package not longer than 4 pages demonstrating the ability to perform requirements based on technical qualification requirements.   Packages should also include the following information:  (1) Business name, address, CAGE code/DUNS, size classification based on NAICS size standard,  and a point of contact,  (2) evidence of your proposed staff experience which meets Government minimum experience requirements.

<CONTACT>Sharon A. Masciana, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-245-6132, Email Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov - Pamela W. Bone, Contracting Officer , Phone 202-245-6181, Email Pamela.Bone@ed.gov
<DESC>Solicitation number: ED-IES-11-R-0036
<p>Title: Regional Educational Laboratories 2011-2016</p>
<p>The Department of Education (ED), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE), intends to award five-year contracts for each of the ten laboratory regions as specified in the Education Sciences and Reform Act (ESRA) of 2002, Part D, Section 174 (20 U.S.C. 9564) administered by the Institute of Education Sciences. As required by the authorizing legislation ED shall enter into contracts for a 5-year period.</p>
<p>The purpose is to enter into contracts with entities to establish a networked system of ten regional laboratories that serve the needs of each region of the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) will carry out a range of activities to serve the needs of each region in the United States in accordance with the provisions stated in the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) of 2002 . These activities will include applied research, and development, dissemination, training, and technical assistance activities that focus on how to use data and analysis.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the RELs is to help states and districts systematically use data and analysis to answer important issues of policy and practice with the goal of improving student outcomes. Each REL will build research capacity and a knowledge base in states and districts by:<br /><br />(1) Assisting states, districts, and schools in using their data systems;<br />(2) Conducting and supporting high quality research and evaluation analyses that focus on a few key topics; and <br />(3) Helping education policy makers and practitioners incorporate data-based inquiry practices into regular decision-making. <br /><br />The RELs will carry out these priorities primarily by organizing partnerships or networks of practitioners, policy makers, and others in "research alliances." A research alliance is defined as a group of stakeholders (Local Education Agencies, State Education Agencies, and others) who agree to work together to use data to learn more about a specific education concern in order to make sound decisions to improve education outcomes. The structure, size, and focus of each alliance will reflect the needs of the region. RELs are encouraged to form regional, cross-state, or cross-district research alliances where appropriate, and/or to partner with existing alliances. Also, the RELs will conduct rigorous research and evaluation studies that may require 3 to 4 years to plan, implement, and prepare analytic report(s).</p>
<p>Expected Outcomes</p>
<p>The priority for the REL program and the mechanism for delivering REL services are intended to yield several important benefits for the regions and for the nation. These include:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of a cohesive and potentially deep body of knowledge in core, priority areas for each region and nationally, rather than spreading REL work thinly over many issues;<br />&bull; Increased use of evaluation, data, and analysis in how officials identify problems, choose programs and strategies, and learn from initiatives;<br />&bull; Completion of a range of rigorous evaluation and research studies, methodologically appropriate to the questions the studies attempt to answer; <br />&bull; Expansion of state and local capacity to use their own data, conduct high quality research and evaluation, and appropriately incorporate findings into policy and practice; <br />&bull; Distribution of REL work across the region, with a transparent and equitable process for REL assistance; and<br />&bull; Establishment of strong partnerships among practitioners, policy makers, and researchers that are not dependent on ongoing REL support.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Full and Open Competition. The NAICS codes used to define this procurement: This procurement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is $7 million or less in annual receipts. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. It is anticipated that ten contracts, with a period of performance of 5 years, will be awarded as a result of the RFP. The contract type is anticipated as Firm Fixed Price.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about March 25, 2011 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov. All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Sharon Masciana, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Education, Potomac Center Plaza, OCFO/CAM, 550 12th Street, SW, 7th Floor, Washington, DC 20202-4230. The reference number to be used for the pre-solicitation announcement is: ED-IES-11-R-0036. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by email to Sharon Masciana, Contract Specialist, at Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov or telephone at 202-245-6132 or Pamela Bone, Contracting Officer at Pamela.Bone@ed.gov or by telephone at 202-245-6181.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a requirement to enter into 5-year contracts with qualified entities to establish an Alliance/team of contractors to carry out the design, item development, sampling, materials preparation and distribution, data collection, scoring, analysis, reporting and scheduling of one of its flagship programs, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
<p>NAEP is approaching its 45th anniversary as a mature program in a rapidly changing environment. It is incumbent on the program to maintain its historical role of reporting educational progress while at the same time accommodating and taking advantage of unprecedented changes in education, in education assessment, and in the learning sciences, as well as rapid advances in technology.</p>
<p>There are numerous environmental factors that will influence NAEP during this period, many of which will be referenced throughout this Performance Work Statement (PWS). Examples include:<br />&#61607; transition from a paper-and-pencil to technology-based assessment,<br />&#61607; the emerging interest in international comparisons for states and districts, <br />&#61607; advances in test development and new item types,<br />&#61607; development of measures of preparedness for post-secondary education and work,<br />&#61607; adoption of common content standards by most states that may or may not align with NAEP content frameworks, <br />&#61607; development of two separate common state-developed assessments based on the common core standards,<br />&#61607; inclusion of more contextual information in reports,<br />&#61607; growth of virtual schools and out-of-school and technology-based learning by students, and <br />&#61607; budget reductions throughout the education and assessment enterprises.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates eight contract awards from this solicitation. The Web/Technology Maintenance and Support and the Alliance Schedule Coordination contracts will be set aside for Small Business, or Small Disadvantaged Business, including 8(a), woman-owned small businesses, HUB Zone Small Businesses, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.</p>
<p>Additional information pertaining to a pre-proposal conference will be provided at the time the solicitation is posted on fedbizopps.gov.</p>

<DESC>The primary goal of the DARPA Robotics Challenge program is to develop ground robotic capabilities to execute complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments. The program will focus on robots that can utilize available human tools, ranging from hand tools to vehicles. The program aims to advance the key robotic technologies of supervised autonomy, mounted mobility, dismounted mobility, dexterity, strength, and platform endurance. Supervised autonomy will be developed to allow robot control by non-expert operators, to lower operator workload, and to allow effective operation despite low fidelity (low bandwidth, high latency, intermittent) communications.

<DESC>1. ANNOUNCEMENT
In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested responders.  
This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  
At this time the nature of the competition has been determined to be an 8(a) set-aside.  Responses to this announcement shall determine if adequate competition exists. All business are encouraged to respond.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is NAICS number 541511 (Custom Computer Programing Services) from Category 54 - Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The size standard is $25,000,000.
2. BACKGROUND
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Aviation Weather Division, Policy and Requirements Branch (ANG-C64), is the federal government's focal point for aviation weather needs, policy, and plans. It is tasked to analyze and perform technical planning support to develop mission analysis, needs analysis, functional requirements and performance requirements for National Airspace System (NAS) users and to harmonize U.S. aviation weather requirements and standards globally. 
ANG-C64 is responsible overseeing the creation and maintenance of the Aviation Weather Assets Database (AWAD), as a depository of pertinent information needed to compute the yearly service standards and publish its associated industry report. A service standard is the level of detail required in weather observations at specific sites where there is a commissioned Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).  In February 1996, the service standards policy was implemented and applied to all FAA and NWS ASOS sites upon commissioning of the ASOS equipment. As ASOS sites were commissioned, FAA and NWS observers were required to adhere to the standard for each individual site. In 2001, FAA and NWS agreed that NWS would no longer provide backup and augmentation services at service level A, B and C locations within the Continental United States.  Throughout 2001 and 2002, NWS transitioned responsibilities for those sites to FAA. 
The draft Statement of Work (SOW) specifies the support and a service required by ANG-C64, pursuant to its mission and is attached hereto.3. PURPOSE
This Market Survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested responders.
Capability Statement
All responders must provide a Capability Statement that addresses the type of services provided by the responder that demonstrate ability to perform the services described in the attached draft SOW.
Mandatory Requirements for Expression of Interest
In order to be considered responsive, responders to this Market Survey expressing interest in this matter must provide the following:
a.	Capability Statement (as defined above)
b.	Completed Business Declaration Form (template attached)
c.	Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status (if applicable)

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Building Automation System Operator Interface (OI). Energy Management Control System User Interface for Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).1. IntroductionThe user interface consists of two major components: the workspace and ribbon.	Theworkspace is the interfaces main focal point and is where most operators willconcentrate their attention.  It is a parent container for Individual tabs consisting ofdisplays, GPL sequences, explorers, alarms, etc.The familiar Microsoft Ribbon Interface is used to navigate easily around the system.  Itis appropriate for both casual operators and system administrators.  The ribbon boastsimprovements to the interface on several fronts:- Deep functionality is brought forward for quick access to the entire system.- Visual navigation increases operator efficiency and decreases required training.-  Logical grouping of navigation and control components yields a clean yet powerfulmeans of traversing the entire system.The user interface incorporates new and proven standards in user interface design; thisreduces training requirements by leveraging the operators prior software experiences. Operator productivity is increased with enhanced navigation techniques.The above improvements speak to ease of use and the overall user experience.  Significanteffort however, was also given to enhancing the softwares data mining and presentationcapabilities.  Together, these yield a clean, powerful and pleasing interface designedspecifically to boost operator performance and increase system insight.2. RibbonThe ribbon is a grouped collection of graphical buttons designed to easily navigate,manage, and control all aspects of the system.	Logical grouping is accomplished usingribbon tabs; each tab name is representative of the ribbon category, i.e. those thingswhich it contains.The ribbon utilizes a designated common area for the graphical interface buttons.  Thebuttons in the common area are reflective of the selected tab category; when a new tab isselected, the common area is updated to show the buttons associated with said tab.A dynamic ribbon makes the software more intuitive and easy to use.  For instance, whenselecting a value on a display, the ribbon automatically updates to indicate commonactions that might target the value.3. WorkspaceThe workspace occupies the majority area of the interface.  It is home to displays,sequences, explorers, alarm views, etc. organized as a set of tabs.  Tabbed workflow isthe workspaces easy-access counterpart to the Ribbon Interface.  It facilitatesextremely fast movement between all open system views.	Tabs may be rearranged, broke outas a unique window, and re-docked with other tabs.The left, right, and bottom sides of the workspace are dockable areas.	These areas allowthe operator to dock toolbars or groups of toolbars to the workspace; this is conduciveto quickly reviewing multifaceted system information and it optimizes real-timeinterrogation of system status.4. Reports TabThe ribbons report tab facilitates viewing, creating, and/or scheduling of reports. Specifically, it includes shortcuts to: Create a tabular or graphical report Launch the report explorer to view all available reports View and/or run recently opened reports View, create, or modify scheduled reportsReporting (i.e. mining data) is the operators tool to assess past and present systemperformance.  This may be used to compare energy usage between the current year and pastyears, highlight problematic areas in the system, and/or to help determine equipmentmaintenance needs.The user interface equips operators and administrators to effectively mine and analyzedata in the following ways: Graphical reports convey information quickly; multiple types are supported such as pieand line. Selectable date ranges per data series element simplifies past / present comparisons. Support of in-report mathematics.- For example, unit conversions such as gal/min to gal/hour can be accomplished veryeasily; this is a very simple example but the same methods can be used to manipulate thedata set with complex formulas.- Create new datasets from the existing data.  For example, assume there exist threepieces of information regarding a pump: runtime, energy consumption, and energy cost. The cost of ownership (energy only) could be estimated by creating a fourth column basedon the first three (runtime data * energy consumption data * cost of energy).-  Option to include summary data per dataset (sums, averages, max, min, etc.) Friendly report titles, dataset names, column titles, etc. User specified tags may be included in report generation.The reports explorer lists all available reports in the system.  All available reportsare comprised of: System Reports  Administrator created and managed.  Available to all users. User Contributed Reports  Created, managed, and shared by other users. My Reports  Individual operators created reports; these can be shared with others ifdesired.Scheduled reports automatically run at predetermined times, dates, and/or frequency. Schedules can be created for any report an operator has access to.  For example, if Bobshares an equipment runtime report, Jim can create a schedule for this report to run. The generated report is only available to Bob; other users cannot see the generatedreport.Automatically generated reports can be saved to a file, printed, uploaded to the cloud,or emailed to one or more personnel.5. Points TabThe points tab and explorer target points consisting of Analog Inputs (AI), AnalogOutputs (AO), Analog Values (AV), Digital Inputs (DI), Digital Outputs (DO), and DigitalValues (DV).  This ribbon tab consists of shortcut to the points explorer, recent andfavorite points, as well as quick create buttons for each point type (AI, AO, AV, DI, DO,DV).  Recent points contain shortcuts to points that were recently opened.  Favoritesfunctions the same as any web browser favorites listing and is simply a list of pointsmarked as favorite by the user, providing quick access to a list of points the user isinterested in.Much of the point explorers operation is generic in nature, and is described inSectionX, Additional Features  Explorer.6. Additional FeaturesA. ExplorerExplorers are used to find, open, and/or edit a particular point, display, schedule, etc. Several different explorers available to accommodate the different objects in thesystem, including: System Explorer  The traditional point selector has been repurposed with a powerfulsystem explorer.  This explorer makes available everything in the system from Devices toScripts to Time of Day schedules.  Theres also an option to emulate the traditionalpoint selector. Points Explorer  As its name suggests, the points explorer targets points consistingof AIs, AOs, AVs, DIs, DOs, and DVs. Display Explorer  Also as its name suggests, the display explorer contains a listingof all displays in the system.Several generic features common to all explorers are: Search Search result listings in real time (listing updates per the search criteria asthe operator types). Property Columns  Now object properties can be viewed alongside search results.  Eachproperty adds a column to the search results and can be added/removed at will. Filters  In addition to Search, powerful filters can be used to narrow down the resultlistings. Property Inspector  This is a list style view of all the properties of a single objector group of objects.  When an object is selected from the explorer, the property / valuepairs are populated with the selected objects values.	If multiple objects are selected,differing values are indicated with a * character.  If the property values are thesame, the actual value will be used.  Only properties common to all selected objects aredisplayed.B. ToolbarsA number of toolbars are included in the user interface.  Toolbars are dockable,mini-windows offering insight to many different aspects of the system.	Included are:- Alarms  One or more toolbars can be used to indicate active, historical, pagingalarms, and/or alarms by alarm class.- Property Inspector  Displays a full list of properties for selected system objects. One or more objects can be selected to easily view and/or edit common properties.- Recent Activity  A shortlist of a users recently accessed points, displays, reports,etc.C. WizardsOptional wizards with step-by-step instructions assist users in creating points, reports,displays, schedules, etc.  These empower casual users to do more unassisted work, freeingpower users and system administrators to focus on the tasks that matter most.D. Multi-Monitor SupportNative support for multiple monitors allows operators to see many aspects of the systemat a glance.E. Remember Window Placements, Per UserThe interfaces ability to reside on multiple monitors also means more time is requiredto achieve the desired setup.  This should only have to be done once.  The interfaceremembers all window and toolbar placements, open displays, etc. so the next time theuser logs in, he/she can begin right where they left off; this eliminates interface setupand allows operators to get to work right away.F. TagsAll objects in the system (Devices, Points, Reports, Displays, etc.) support tags.  Tagsare simply one or two word descriptors of an object and are used to help group, filter,and search system objects; multiple tags per object are supported.  A tag browsersimplifies management of tags in the system.G. Security ControlsSecurity control and administration support a simple security concept, with animplementation possibly similar to Windows ACL.a. User-level and group-level permissions.b. Permissions propagate from parent objects child objects.c. User/Group/Object permissions reports.d. User/Group/Object permissions modifiable individually or many at one time.H. Alarm Managementa. Include additional filtering beyond current alarm classes (default, urgent, critical,emergency), with consideration for the following: Collapsible, expandable grouping of common messages. Filter by message type i.e. show all Off in Alarm, show all On in Alarm, show allAbove High Limit, etc. Filter by exclusion, i.e. do not show certain message types in the view.b. Support for individual event messages for each object type or event type andcustomized alarm message text.c. Multi-state alarms, selectable on a per-state basis.d. Work order initiation supported within alarm views.I. Equipment MaintenanceBetter equipment maintenance tools and integrated work order issuance simplifiesequipment management and allows users to quickly review and find problematic equipment.a. On a per-point basis (similar to Remarks field), record by operator input, a historyof work performed.  The following Fields/information will be included (minimum): workorder number, description of task, start date, and end date.J. Dynamic Report UpdatesAlthough printed reports cannot change, digital on-screen reports can.	Now after areport is generated, last second changes are reflected on-screen and still make their wayto paper when printed.	NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Dorsett Technologies, Inc., Yadkinville,North Carolina pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) foracquisition of supplies or services or services will satisfy agency requirements.Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1. The critical nature of the BAS requires 100% compatibility between the software andhardware that comprise MSFCs Building Automation System.  Dorsett Technologies is thesole manufacturer and provider of products certified to be 100% compatible with MSFCsInfo-Scan BAS.	The Facilities Maintenance Office (FMO) utilizes the Dorsett TechnologiesOperator Interface 24/7 and no significant disruption in service is allowed.  Theexisting Dorsett Technologies engineering staff has the historical knowledge and skillspertinent to the effective performance of this requirement and therefore, no downtime andminimal workforce re-training associated with modifying the existing Dorsett TechnologiesOperator Interface would be required.2. Modification of the existing Dorsett Technologies proprietary Operator Interface isrequired to provide for enhanced functionality in the areas of operability, datareporting, data archiving, work tracking, ease of use, and to provide additionalmanagement tools necessary for effective and efficient management and operation ofequipment connected to the BAS.3. Due to the proprietary nature of the communications protocol between the DorsettTechnologies server OI software and the existing Dorsett Technologies field hardware,there is no commercial off the shelf Operator Interface software package that is 100%compatible with the existing Dorsett Technologies field hardware.4. The current contractor workforce that operates and maintains the existing DorsettTechnologies system has been reduced in staffing and due to possible budgetaryconstraints has the potential to be reduced even further.  It would place an undue burdenon the workforce to become familiar with a new Operator Interface and associatedhardware.  This could result in excessive hardware downtime and could potentially lead todamage to critical equipment and space flight hardware.5. The cost to modify the existing proprietary Dorsett Technologies Operator Interface,which maintains 100% compatibility with existing hardware, versus replacing the entireBAS is more advantageous and cost effective to the Government as was determined throughMarket Research.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon April 25, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Small Business concern that possesses the research and development (R&D) expertise to conduct innovative research that will contribute toward meeting the program objectives of the NHLBI Transcatheter Cerclage Mitral Valve Annuloplasty for Secondary Mitral Regurgitation.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of the Small Business Innovative Research Technology Transfer (SBIR TT) Contract Proposals Solicitation: NHLBI-HL-13-15.  THIS IS A SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.

The purposes of the SBIR TT program are to: (1) stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; (2) strengthen the use of small businesses to meet Federal Research/Research & Development (R/R&D) needs; (3) foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and by small business concerns that are 51 percent owned and controlled by women, in technological innovation; and (4) increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R/R&D, thereby increasing competition, productivity, and economic growth.  This is an SBIR TT (Technology Transfer) contract topic from the NHLBI.  This is a program whereby inventions from the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research are licensed to qualified small businesses with the intent that those businesses develop these inventions into commercial products that benefit the public.  

For purposes of the SBIR TT program, a small business concern is any business concern that, on the date of award, (1) is organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States, which operates primarily within the United States or which makes a significant contribution to the United States economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; (2) is in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture, association, trust or cooperative, except that where the form is a joint venture, there can be no more than 49 percent participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture; (3) is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States; or is owned and controlled by another (one) small business concern that is itself at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States; AND (4) has, including its affiliates, no more than 500 employees.

Secondary mitral valve regurgitation is a common contributor to heart failure, and is caused by annular expansion and papillary muscle traction. Secondary mitral valve regurgitation may be amenable to surgical annuloplasty, which reduces mitral valve annular size to enhance coaptation of the otherwise normal leaflets.

NHLBI labs have developed a novel non-surgical catheter-based approach to annuloplasty called “cerclage annuloplasty.”  Using enhanced image guidance, catheter tools traverse a trajectory including the coronary sinus, a basal septal perforator vein, a short transmyocardial pathway through the interventricular septum, and the right ventricular inflow tract.  Once this pathway is established, circumferential tension is applied to reduce annular dimensions.  Serendipitous features of cerclage annuloplasty include preservation of mitral annular deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, and reciprocal entrapment of the left ventricular outflow tract to enhance coaptation of the anterior mitral leaflet during systole.

We have established the potential utility of cerclage annuloplasty in a porcine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. To translate the project into humans will require development of commercial-grade interventional tools to make a clinical procedure simple and safe, including device and regulatory development, followed by early clinical testing.  NHLBI has four patent applications filed related to cerclage annuloplasty.

A catheter-based annuloplasty like cerclage may have value as a primary therapy for secondary mitral regurgitation.  Alternatively cerclage annuloplasty may have value as an adjunctive therapy combined, for example, with leaflet clip procedures.  It may also have value in less-severe disease not justifying surgical morbidity, or to relieve symptoms accompanied by severe comorbidity precluding surgical therapy.

The NHLBI anticipates one award under this SBIR TT solicitation. 

This is an SBIR TT (Technology Transfer) contract topic from the NHLBI. This is a new program whereby inventions from the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research are licensed to qualified small businesses with the intent that those businesses develop these inventions into commercial products that benefit the public. The contractor funded under this NHLBI SBIR TT contract topic shall work closely with the NHLBI inventor(s) of this technology, who will assist in pre-clinical experiments and will perform a clinical trial using offeror’s product.  The NHLBI inventor(s) will provide assistance in a collaborative manner with catheter designs, procedure techniques, clinical considerations, and discussions during the entire award period. 

An SBIR TT contractor will automatically be granted a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use NIH-owned and patented background invention(s) only within the scope and term of the award.  However, an SBIR offeror or SBIR contractor can apply for an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license to make, use, and sell products or services incorporating the NIH background invention(s).  Offerors submitting an SBIR contract proposal in response to this solicitation are strongly encouraged to submit concurrently an application for a commercialization license to such background invention(s). Under the NHLBI SBIR TT program, the SBIR contract award process will be conducted in parallel with, but distinct from, the review of any applications for a commercialization license.

**SOPHOS brand required**  Through a competitive procurement in 2005, EPA's Office of Technology Operations and Planning selected SOPHOS Puremessage software as the Agency Anti-Spam/Malware/Anti-Virus Email Gateway filtering solution.  SOPHOS Puremessage was selected because it met the government?s technical requirements at the lowest cost.  Maintaining this on-going software maintenance agreementensures Agency email architectural stability, consistent performance for mission-critical email service, no additional hardware costs to support new systems, no increase in contract support cost (i.e., learning, administering, and training others on a new system), and consistent end-user experience for 25,000 Agency email customers.

<p>Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency of other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer of as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security, <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202-475-3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Subject Matter Expert (SME) support of the Web Comprehensive Cost and Requirement (Web CCaRTM) system for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (DD 1423), the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet and the Customer List where services will be performed.
<p>Attachments are included to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the AFLCMC and AFRL and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>The requirements of this task are for the provision of Web CCaRTM application support for the unique funding, planning, reconciliation, execution and reporting requirements and interface capabilities with various Government systems and applications for activities associated with AFLCMC and AFRL organizations, as well as in-depth experience and expertise to quickly and accurately respond to the wide variety of financial tasks and unique formats required for detailed financial and program related reporting. Contractor personnel must have knowledge of Air Force financial, contracting, and program management procedures, understand the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process, and understand the Requirements &amp; Planning Council (R&amp;PC) process. Web CCaRTM SME support must and have the familiarity with operating web-based database programs, as well as be proficient in all Web CCaRTM applications.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide functional support of the Web CCaRTM application. Web CCaRTM SME support provide assistance and support to Web CCaRTM Administrators, needed to carry out Web CCaRTM administrative functions and Web CCaRTM functional tasks which includes, but are not limited to, the following: set-up, configuration, daily operation and training of the Web CCaRTM application in direct support to AFLCMC and AFRL organizations. Web CCaRTM SME support must have extensive knowledge of the following systems and how they interface with Web CCaRTM: Government Accounting and Finance System (GAFS), Automated Business Systems Solutions (ABSS), Contract Writing Document Preparation (ConWrite), and System Metric and Requirements Tool (SMART); as well as other systems that do not directly interface with Web CCaRTM, i.e. Commander's Resource Integration System (CRIS) and Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS). Web CCaRTM SME support shall ensure that the Web CCaRTM application is properly tailored and configured to meet the unique requirements of the organization to include reimbursable Government accounting and various Business Management Review (BMR) chart configurations.</p>
<p>This effort will require a current Secret Facility Clearance.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates utilizing a hybrid contract with Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Reimbursable CLINs. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be a base year and two (2) option years. A multi-year contract allows for reduced staff manpower to initiate and award. This also allows stability with the eventual winner, i.e. able to sign employees to longer term contracts thus generating further efficiencies and best ensuring continuity in the support provided to the Government. Upon award of the option years, the same contractor is ready and able to deliver required services on day one without the need for transition time, or downtime, which again, creates efficiencies for the Government.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 6-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements, including the requirement for personnel to plan and part-mark 15 - 45 locations worldwide simultaneously and how the contractor will finance these operations. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to ASC/PKEIE . Statements should be submitted no later than 25 April 2012 at NOON EST.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought<br>Title: ASC Public Affairs Exhibits Program<br>This is a Sources Sought Notice (SS). This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified contractors to research, plan, and execute displays for the Army Sustainment Command (ASC) Public Affairs Office (PAO).  Interested parties should respond by providing a Capability Statement, see paragraph entitled "Capability Statement/Information Sought" on page 3.<br>Purpose and Objectives:<br>The requiring activity is the Army Sustainment Command Public Affairs Office.  The ASC PAO is responsible for ensuring ASC command information campaign supports the Army's Strategic Communication programs which are aligned with Army efforts to support Soldiers and Families, prepare the force for ongoing operations worldwide, reset Army units as they cycle through deployments and transform the Army for an era of persistent conflict. ASC is required to keep numerous and diverse internal and external audiences and stakeholders, including Congress, Office of the Secretary of the Army, other Army and joint forces leaders and organizations, and the communities surrounding ASC units,  informed about all aspects of  ASC, its role as the Army Materiel Command's Operational Arm to the Army, its programs and ongoing operations. ASC integrates and synchronizes Army Materiel Command's capabilities. Therefore, the Contractor must be able to conceptually develop and implement communication strategies, processes and products for this effort. <br>The Government requires contracted assistance to provide required display and exhibit expertise for two large exhibitions: the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Meeting & Exposition in October and the AUSA Winter Symposium and Exhibition in February. The ASC Contractor is required to continue developing support services which shall include: interactive and technically innovative displays to use within the larger Army Materiel Command exhibit.  The Contractor must understand ASC and its subordinate brigades/battalions' communication challenges and a mission that involves high-visibility issues, global programs, and the absolute requirement to support Soldiers, Civilians and Families.  <br>Project Requirements:<br>This task requires the contactor to provide planning, research, expertise and implementation of innovative and interactive displays to include in the AMC exhibits for the AUSA annual and winter exhibitions, as well as support services, to include shipment, installation, teardown, and display maintenance before, during, and after the show. ASC develops, in effect, mini exhibits within the larger AMC exhibition area, to include not only interactive displays, but physical builds to enhance the ASC experience. <br>The Contractor shall develop experiences that educate internal and external audiences about Army Sustainment Command's missions and programs within AMC's main themes of: People are Our Army; Nation's Force of Decisive Action - Ready Today, Prepared for Tomorrow; and Meeting the Needs of the Nation, as well as the themes and messages pertinent to future exhibits. <br>The Army Sustainment Command has always provided interesting, innovative, educational and interactive displays for the AMC exhibits. We are looking for companies that can help us continue to provide this same standard in future AMC exhibits.<br>The contractor must display the following capabilities:<br>Interactive technical displays: The contractor must have the technical expertise to program interactive computer, electronic displays that allow the audience to drill down at least three levels to illustrate ASC programs, using touch screen or pinch technology. The programming must be of the highest industry standards. The graphics for these displays must be visually interesting, educational, and able to draw the viewer into the exhibit. The Contractor does not have to have Department of Defense organizations as its primary customer base, but must have experience with what government exhibitors can and cannot do based on regulations and law. <br>Physical displays: The Contract must have the expertise to surround the interactive electronic display with a physical look that complements the display's theme. Physical displays in the past have included a Vietnam War-era supply tent, the front of a Humvee, and a futuristic "portal." <br>Special effects: The "wow" factor in an ASC display generally comes from the special effects that draw visitors into the display. Some special effects used by ASC include, but are not limited to, a hologram; a animated figure dressed as a Vietnam-era soldier that speaks to the audience; a pedestal that visitors use to control the interactive presentation inside the portal. Some of the special effects ASC has used in the past are also available at museums, theme parks and large corporate displays throughout the world. ASC is always looking for new ways to tell its story, so the special effects expertise shown in a Source Sought must be unique. <br>The requirements and limitations for a Contractor are as follows:<br>Timelines: A Contractor must be flexible and be able to adjust to very short deadlines based on higher headquarters schedules. In some situations, the contractor must be able to produce a high-quality display based on the contract proposal in less than 30 days. <br>Space limitations: The Contractor must be able to produce an interactive display within the AMC corporate exhibit. The usual space limits within the exhibit for each subordinate command is approximately 10'X5' to 10'X10'.  <br>Higher headquarters requirements: Display designs may have to be adjusted based on Army Materiel Command requirements. This could mean changing elements of a display in a short period of time to accommodate space limitations and changes in themes and messages.  <br>Cost: The contractor must be able to produce a display within ASC public affairs budgetary limitations. Funding is generally obtained and approved before contract award. The cost is approximately $70,000 per show.<br>Capability Statement/Information Sought:<br>Respondents must provide, as part of their responses, information concerning each of the project requirements listed above along with (a) staff experience, including their availability, experience, and training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capabilities; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information. <br>Other requirements include: demonstrated ability by the Contractor to meet potentially tight deadlines, and demonstrate that the Contractor knows the laws and policies regulating government exhibiting. <br>Interested qualified contractors should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement as well as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price, not to exceed 25 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, ROM, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. Respondents must also provide a copy of Central Contractor Registration (CCR) that reflects Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Commercial and Government Entity (Cage) code. <br>Information Submission Instructions:<br>All Capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Kathleen Ward, Contract Specialist, at kathleen.m.ward20.civ@mail.mil and Katherine Cope, Contract Specialist, at katherine.m.cope4.civ@mail.mil in MS Word, WordPerfect, or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), NLT COB Friday, 20 April, 2012. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered. No telephonic or hard copy responses will be considered or accepted. Additionally, all questions must be submitted in writing via email to the same addresses above. <br>Disclaimer and Important Notes:<br>This notice is for planning purposes only and does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any contractor responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the contractor's qualifications to perform the work.

Support, Maintain and Update the Project Profiler</strong> - The Contractor shall be provided with the source code and content for the existing Project Profiler, a portion of the web-based knowledge management system developed by the prior Contractor for templated project documentation, and shall assume support and maintenance. The existing Project Profiler web application includes a robust versioning system to allow older versions of the project profiles to be available; and informing readers that newer versions are available and guiding them to updated materials as appropriate. The Contractor shall provide training for new users, and moderate incoming content to make it consistent with other similar projects. The Contractor shall guide users as profiles are "uploaded" from their own private sites where they have first developed their project profiles, to a group collaborative site (i.e. a site open to selected NCI staff and all appropriate users), and finally to public websites (either maintained by others or the Contractor). The Contractor shall adapt the existing Project Profiler in consultation with the Government.</p>
<p><strong>3. Support, Maintain and Update the Project Registration and Discovery System</strong> - The Contractor shall be provided with the source code and content of an existing Project Registration and Discovery system. The Contractor shall maintain this public-facing system that is a searchable registry of projects in which users briefly describe their projects using a number of generalized project attributes, as well as, brief free-form descriptions of the projects' purpose, relevant domain and development team specifics. The system will provide a high level view of projects and will be searchable across projects.</p>
<p><strong>4. Support and Development of Project Model Interface Systems</strong> - The Contractor shall, at the discretion of the Government, provide support for assisting in the development of web-based interactive public interfaces for specific projects. These interfaces will help put a "public face" on a project and will allow users to explore the responses to inputs. The Contractor shall be provided with the source code and content of existing interface systems, and be responsible for enhancing existing systems and develop new working interface systems.</p>
<p><strong>5. Hardware and Software Support</strong> - The Contractor shall have sufficient knowledge and experience to assume support of the existing source code and content.

<DESC>Yellowstone National Park is seeking input from vendors in regards to the purchase of a digital voice logging system. Our market research has determined that only one brand name product Red Box will meet our needs due to the following:
Yellowstone is routinely recreating events that go back several years and it would greatly benefit the users of the new system to use one call retrieval system for incident recreation. This system will be able to look back at our current NICE recorder and retrieve calls from that system.  Red Box incident retrieval software is currently the only vendor Yellowstone has found that can work with the NICE recorder.
The current system uses an old database search engine that is not user friendly. The new system's search engine (Red Box) will look back at our old database and extract old data. We are trying to expand the user's that can access the database so that Communication Center and Law Enforcement personnel can use the new system and will not have to wait until a technician is available to retrieve the data. With the Red Box system, technicians/Communication Center/LE personnel will use one new, user friendly, database search engine to retrieve calls and help with the reconstruction of incidents on the new database and/or the old database with one retrieval system.
Any vendors wishing to comment are encouraged to submit their comments in writing to Andrea_Hannon@nps.gov. 
If you are a vendor whose product can interface with the NICE system please email in supporting information and Yellowstone National Park will review your product before a combined synopsis/solicitation is issued.

<CONTACT>John Schiffhauer, Contract Specialist, Phone 6182299481, Email john.schiffhauer@disa.mil
<DESC>PURPOSE: DISA Engineering Directorate is conducting this Request for Information (RFI), for its architecture support effort to analyze existing DISA technical architectures and use model based systems engineering methods to develop and/or evolve technical architectures using tools compatible with DISA's architecture tool suite. DISA's architecture tool suite uses the standards-based systems modeling language (SysML) and can produce DoDAF compliant artifacts. SMEs in systems engineering, service oriented architecture (SOA) architecting, network engineering, information systems, information assurance, and integration services aligned with specific DISA domain areas are required to support this task. The contractor will provide SMEs to analyze, develop, or evolve technical solutions and document them with SysML models, diagrams, and technical documents. The resulting products, developed by both government and contractor personnel will provide value throughout the life-cycle of DISA programs and projects by providing more precise understanding of how systems work. These products will also ensure stakeholder requirements are being satisfied, increase interoperability, and provide the basis for on-going verification and validation that ultimately reduces risk. Additionally, the architecture tool suite will be used to provide DoDAF compliant artifacts from the SysML models.<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the DISA Enterprise Engineering Architecture Support In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for all interested small businesses to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with support for the DISA Enterprise Engineering Architecture Support contract needs. Interested parties should describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with development &amp; analysis of technical architectures, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), networking, enterprise solutions, information assurance, integration services, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), MBSE tools, SysML models, Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF), cloud based solutions and services. All interested contractors are requested to provide written response to the requested information below. A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services. In addition, this information will also be used to assist DISA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan and/or small business goal percentages.</p>
<p>This acquisition has 3 tasks as listed below:<br /><br />Task 1 - Project Management<br />Task 2 - Develop and Analyze Technical Architectures<br />Task 3 - Enterprise Infrastructure</p>
<p>Enterprise Engineering Architecture Support shall accomplish the tasks outlined, the winner of this effort shall be required to cooperate and work with the contractor supporting the architecture support effort. This work must be conducted on and off government facilities DISA headquarters at Fort Meade, MD</p>

<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Pittsburgh District intends to issue an unrestricted solicitation for a new interlock system located at three locks and dam facilities, Pike Island, New Cumberland and Hannibal on the Ohio River. Proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price contract. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to compete and perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The type of solicitation issued will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis. The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors.</p>
<p>The general scope of work includes an interlock system to incorporate the following required features:</p>
<p>&#61623; Valve-to-Gate Interlocks</p>
<p>&#61623; Gate-to-Valve Interlocks</p>
<p>&#61623; Valve-to-Valve Interlocks</p>
<p>The Valve-to Gate interlocks shall only allow the filling valves to open if the downstream miter gates are mitered and shall only allow the emptying valves to open if the upstream miter gates are mitered.</p>
<p>The Valve-to Valve interlocks shall only allow the filling valves to open if the emptying valves are closed and vice versa. Under normal operating circumstances, the filling valves and emptying valves cannot be open simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Gate-to-Valve interlocks shall only allow the downstream miter gates to operate (open and close), if the filling valves are closed and shall only allow the upstream miter gates to operate (open and close), if the emptying valves are closed.</p>
<p>In addition to the three types of interlocks mentioned above, under no circumstances can a set of miter gates be opened if the opposite miter gates are not closed. This situation may be physically impossible to achieve, but is still taken into account in the design of the interlocks.</p>
<strong>
<p>Interlock Control Panel</p>
</strong>
<p>The new interlock system shall consist of a centrally located interlock control panel for each lock chamber. The interlock control panel shall be the main control enclosure for the interlock control system. All limit switches on the miter gates, miter gate machinery, filling valves and emptying valves shall be hardwired to relays in the enclosure. The enclosure shall contain key operated bypass switches for each limit switch and shall indicate when a limit switch has been bypassed. When a limit switch is bypassed, a visual indicator shall flash to alert personnel of this condition. Visual indication shall consist of a red, flashing indicator at each location valves and/or miter gates are operated and on the interlock control enclosure. In addition to visual indication, an audible alarm shall be provided if a lock operation is interrupted or cannot be performed due to interlock permissives being violated. The audible alarm can be silenced, but will re-activate if the lock operation is continued and the fault condition still exists.</p>
<strong>
<p>Limit Switches</p>
</strong>
<p>New magnetic, leverless limit switches and wiring shall be installed at all locations. Limit switches required for the new interlock system consist of the following:</p>
<p>&#61623; Down Stream Mite Gates Mitered</p>
<p>&#61623; Down Stream Land Wall Miter Gate Machinery Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Down Stream River Wall Miter Gate Machinery Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Down Stream Land Wall Miter Gate Recess</p>
<p>&#61623; Down Stream River Wall Miter Gate Recess</p>
<p>&#61623; Emptying Valve Land Wall Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Emptying Valve River Wall Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Up Stream Mite Gates Mitered</p>
<p>&#61623; Up Stream Land Wall Miter Gate Machinery Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Up Stream River Wall Miter Gate Machinery Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Up Stream Land Wall Miter Gate Recess</p>
<p>&#61623; Up Stream River Wall Miter Gate Recess</p>
<p>&#61623; Filling Valve Land Wall Closed</p>
<p>&#61623; Filling Valve River Wall Closed</p>
<strong>
<p>Filling and Emptying Valve Controls</p>
</strong>
<p>The existing filling and emptying valve controls shall be rewired to interface with the new interlock relay control panel. All filling and emptying valves shall be controlled by momentary pushbuttons.</p>
<strong>
<p>Miter Gate Controls</p>
</strong>
<p>The miter gates are controlled by manually operated 4-way valves. The existing levers and 4-way valves shall be utilized and interfaced to the new interlock control system.</p>
<strong>
<p>Mechanical Modifications to Miter Gate Cylinders</p>
</strong>
<p>The mechanical work involves installing a custom blocking manifold in the A &amp; B lines for every miter gate cylinder at three projects (Pike Island, New Cumberland and Hannibal). The manifolds will block flow of hydraulic fluid to/from the cylinders until the interlock control system simultaneously opens the valve for each line. This work should be done by a company that specializes in the installation and testing of hydraulic fluid power equipment.</p>
<p>Estimated Construction Range: Between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000</p>
<p>Duration of project is 365 calendar days.</p>
<p>North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition is 238220. Small Business Size Standard for this acquisition is $14 Million.</p>
<p>Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under the sources sought synopsis.</p>
<p>Offerors response to this Synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information:</p>
<p>"Offerors name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>"Offerors interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.</p>

This is NOT a Request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses received to this RFI.  The Government will not pay for any response or demonstration expenses.  Any information received will become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.

This RFI is issued for market research, analysis, and planning necessary to successfully implement an industry best practice, enterprise-wide Disaster Recovery (DR) processing infrastructure and its related processes in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information & Technology (OI&T).  This includes creating and assisting in applying an overarching OI&T DR platform solution, including tools, templates, guidance, and support necessary to apply it to OI&T programs, projects, and activities.  The continuation of the approach will emphasize the continuity of existing services and the definition of a plan to streamline, unify, or merge redundant solutions into an enterprise DR approach with particular emphasis on an understanding of the criticality of systems and acceptable degrees of tolerance in the event of a failure.  The long-term task is to refine and standardize DR and platform capability to be inclusive of all application deployments housed on both physical and/or virtual servers, including DR switch-over of all systems, applications and dependencies at VA data centers, allowing VA OI&T and staff to operate more efficiently and effectively

The RFI will be posted immediately following the sources sought notice under RFI number VA118A-12-I-0101.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Mission and Installation Contracting Command - White Sands Office plans to award a sole source bridge contract to Trax International, LLC.  Trax International is the current provider of the Mission Support Services under contract number W9124Q-07-C-0504. Due to changes in approval thresholds and incorporation of Operational Test Command requirements, additional time is required to conduct the follow on competition. Awarding a bridge contract is the only feasible solution as obtaining approval to extend the current contract is considered to be outside the original scope and is therefore unallowable. All announcements pertaining to the re-compete effort will be announced under solicitation number W9124Q-11-R-0101. Any questions in regards to this notice must be submitted to Mari Beckler at mari.b.beckler.civ@mail.mil no later than 4:30pm MDT on 17 April 2012.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information Regarding the Reinsurance Program under the Affordable Care Act
<SOLNBR>HHS-CMS-DBSC-RFI-11-621
<RESPDATE>011612
<CONTACT>Brian J Humes, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-787-8898, Email brian.humes@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Information Regarding the Reinsurance Program under the Affordable Care Act</span></strong>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> This notice is a request for information (RFI) to gain market information on entities that could administer a transitional reinsurance program. This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides that each State must establish a transitional reinsurance program to help stabilize premiums for coverage in the individual market during the first three years of Exchange operation (2014-2016). On July 15, 2011, the Departments of Health and Human Services (CMS) published a proposed rule regarding the reinsurance program and other premium stabilization components of the ACA. The proposed rule provides standards to States establishing or contracting with a not-for-profit reinsurance entity responsible for carrying out the transitional reinsurance program, including collecting reinsurance contributions from issuers and third-party administrators, and calculating and disbursing reinsurance payments to eligible individual market issuers.</p>
<p>This RFI solicits information about entities that could function as a reinsurance entity for the transitional reinsurance program. CMS or one or more States may contract for services required to fulfill the statutory and regulatory requirements of the reinsurance entity. <br /><br /><strong>DATES:</strong> Submit written or electronic comments by 4:00 PM ET on January 16, 2012.<br /><br />We note that responses to this RFI are not offers, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or to issue a grant. The purpose of this RFI is to gather public comments on the proposed rules for reinsurance, risk corridors, or risk adjustment under the ACA. Those comments have been collected and are being evaluated separately. Information obtained in response to this RFI may be used by the Government for program planning and development, or other purposes with or without attribution. Do not include any information that might be considered proprietary or confidential.</p>
<p>Section 1341 of the ACA provides that each State must establish a transitional reinsurance program to help stabilize premiums for coverage in the individual market during the first three years of Exchange operation (2014-2016). The reinsurance program, which is a State-based program, will reduce the uncertainty of insurance risk in the individual market by making payments for high-cost cases. This program will attenuate individual market rate increases that might otherwise occur because of the immediate enrollment of individuals with unknown health status, potentially including, at the state's discretion, those currently in state high-risk pools. CMS published proposed rules for states and health insurance issuers for this reinsurance program on July 15, 2011 at 76 FR 41930.</p>
<p>Section 1321(c) (1) authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the reinsurance program and other components of title I of the Affordable Care Act in states that have not done so. The statute also requires that each State, or CMS on behalf of the State, establish or contract with an entity to carry out the reinsurance program. The reinsurance entity must be a not-for-profit organization with a tax-exempt status.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS:<br /></strong>This RFI seeks comment on the entities that could carry out the transitional reinsurance program. CMS may enter into one or more contracts to fulfill the statutory and regulatory requirements of the transitional reinsurance program established under section 1341 of the ACA depending on the workload and number of States that would require assistance. In such a case, the contractor may be tasked with one or more of the following functions: <br />&bull; collecting reinsurance contributions;<br />&bull; accepting and validating requests for reinsurance payments;<br />&bull; remitting reinsurance payments; <br />&bull; reconciling and verifying reinsurance contributions and payments<br />&bull; maintaining records; and,<br />&bull; providing customer support to issuers.<br /><br />CMS is seeking to engage formally, in a transparent and participatory manner, with entities that understand the reinsurance market, and would be able to perform the responsibilities of a reinsurance entity under the statute and associated regulations. In carrying out the transitional reinsurance program, CMS seeks to mitigate conflicts of interest (COI) that may arise if potential market competitors operate the reinsurance program. As such, we request any information on potential COIs, and potential avenues for mitigation, from all stakeholders, including issuers and third-party administrators. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Infrastructure Questions<br /></strong></span>(1) Does your organization operate as a not-for-profit reinsurance entity in the state(s) in which you currently conduct business? <br />(2) If your organization operates as a reinsurance entity but does not function as a not-for-profit, what steps would have to be taken to convert the organization or the part of that organization responsible for reinsurance operations into a not-for-profit entity? What other considerations should be taken into account in connection with such a conversion? <br />(3) What other steps must your organization take in order to be prepared to smoothly transition into a role as administrator of a new temporary reinsurance program? <br />(4) Does your organization operate nationally or in limited geographic areas? If the latter, what are the geographic areas?<br />(5) Would your organization be able and willing to contract with a State and/or the Federal government to operate a temporary reinsurance program? <br />(6) Are there any State and/or local licensing requirements that must be considered by an organization operating as such a reinsurance entity?<br />(7) What potential conflicts of interest (COI) could arise if your organization were to operate such a reinsurance program as a not-for-profit entity? How might these COIs be mitigated? <br />(8) For organizations that do not currently have COI mitigation programs, what steps would have to be taken to develop and execute such a program? <br />(9) What is a reasonable amount of time for your organization to become fully operational (e.g., have all systems in place to operate a reinsurance program) after the date of a contract award? What resources would be necessary?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collection and Disbursement of Reinsurance Funds Questions<br /></span></strong>(10) Describe your organization's ability to perform the following functions: <br />&bull; collecting reinsurance contributions;<br />&bull; accepting and validating requests for reinsurance payments;<br />&bull; remitting reinsurance payments; and,<br />&bull; reconciling and verifying reinsurance contributions and payments. <br />(11) What services related to the collection of reinsurance contributions, or disbursement of reinsurance payments to another entity would your organization need to subcontract due to a lack of capacity, expertise, or experience? <br />(12) What COIs could arise for such potential subcontractors?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Collection Questions<br /></span></strong>(13) Describe current data systems that are used by your organization, including any standards, security systems, and web-based interactive structure. Are your systems compliant or have the capability of being Section 508 compliant &lt;http://www.section508.gov/&gt;? <br />(14) Do your organization's current data systems have the capability to interface with external systems to accept data and reports? If yes, what types of interfaces are currently in place?<br />(15) What data are currently collected by your organization related to medical costs?<br />(16) What is your organization's current capacity for collecting and verifying claims submissions from issuers? What processes does your organization have in place to ensure confidentiality and security protections of patient information? <br />(17) In what formats does your organization currently collect data? Can your organization support other formats? If so, which ones?<br />(18) Would your organization need to subcontract any services related to data collection? <br />(19) What COIs could arise for such subcontractors?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Support Questions<br /></span></strong>(20) What telecommunication and technical support systems does your organization currently maintain for health insurance issuers or other commercial clients (e.g., websites, 24-hour hotlines, helpdesk)?<br />(21) Are your support systems compliant or have the capability of being Section 508 compliant &lt;http://www.section508.gov/&gt;? <br />(22) Would your organization need to subcontract any services related to data collection? <br />(23) What COIs could arise for such subcontractors?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Questions<br /></span></strong>(24) Does your organization currently conduct evaluations of operations and activities? Do such evaluations include a financial assessment of your organization's activities? <br />(25) What are your organization's current financial and data reconciliation processes?</p>

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a virtual Proposers' Day Workshop for the potential proposer community, for the Robotics Challenge program. The virtual workshop will be held on April 16, 2012 via a live webcast from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM EDT.
<p>The primary goal of the DARPA Robotics Challenge program is to develop ground robotic capabilities to execute complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments. The program will focus on robots that can use available human tools, ranging from hand tools to vehicles. The program aims to advance the key robotic technologies of supervised autonomy, mounted mobility, dismounted mobility, dexterity, strength, and platform endurance. Supervised autonomy will be developed to allow robot control by non-expert operators, to lower operator workload, and to allow effective operation despite low fidelity (low bandwidth, high latency, intermittent) communications.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information - The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) SunShot Initiative seeks feedback from industry, national laboratories, and members of academia relating to the physics of reliability in photovoltaic devices. Due to the wide diversity of deployment conditions for PV systems there exists a variety of failure mechanisms which prevent PV technologies from realizing their full potential. Inability to precisely identify and quantify these mechanisms reduces the capability to simulate real world conditions and provide accurate lifetime information to improve the testing, design, and bankability of PV products.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to award a sole source contract for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements? to GfK Kynetec (GfK) for Agricultural Pesticide Usage Data.
The EPA requires a 2-year subscription to the 2011 & 2012 GfK Kynetec AgroTrak which includes the following:  a) All crops and all pesticide types-database access; b) Base year - historical years database access 1998-2010; Option year 1- historical years database access 1998-2011; c) 20 GfK AgroTrak Licenses; d) 2011 and 2012 Percent Crop Treated, Specialty and Row Crops ?

The required period of performance for this purchase is: Base year 	May 1, 2012 - April 30, 2013 Option year 1	May 1, 2013 - April 30, 2014
Before the EPA takes regulatory actions on pesticides, studies are conducted on human health, environmental, economic and social impacts as required by FIFRA 92-515, as amended.  In order to adequately evaluate health, environmental, social and economic aspects of the use of substitutes for pesticides, a database is needed which contains accurate, current usage data for agricultural pesticides by chemical active ingredient, end-use product, pesticide type, and crop protected.  The type of usage data needed includes the following: total and base acres treated, total pounds applied, the number of farms treated, the time of application, the stage of the pest infestation, pesticide prices and expenditures, the rate of application, target pest and pest complex, the method of application, and other related factors, by state or designated region.This purchase will make available to EPA pesticide market survey data and reports for 1998-2012 and the associated Percent Crop Treated files, which will serve as a critical input in conducting economic and related analyses of pesticide regulatory matters.  These data are for internal use within the EPA, not for release to nonsubscribers or the general public without prior permission of the contractor.  The market studies should provide current data for herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and other pesticides used on various agricultural crops or sites.NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  It has been determined that GfK is the only source for this data that meets the Governments requirements.  No other source has been located which can provide as robust data that is required.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPAs requirement as stated herein, may submit its capability by 8:00 am on Wednesday, April 25, 2012, which may be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete the purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Abbie Jemmott at Jemmott.Abbie@epa.gov.

<p>FAR 52.209-1, Qualification Requirements (Feb 1995)<br />(a) Definition. "Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.</p>

This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.<br />(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.<br />(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS (ITO) AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>1.0 General Instructions</p>
<p>1.1 This source selection will utilize Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures. The offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested by this ITO and must be submitted in accordance with (IAW) these instructions. This section of the Instructions to Offerors (ITO) provides general guidance for preparing proposals as well as specific instructions on the format and content of the proposal. The Offeror's proposal shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Commercial Asset Visibility Air Force (CAV AF) Statement of Work (SOW), Performance Work Statement (PWS), and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). Any Offeror who submits an incomplete package may be considered ineligible for award. Non-conformance with the instructions provided in the ITO may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation.</p>
<p>1.2 The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>1.3. Elaborate brochures, documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.</p>
<p>1.4. The proposal acceptance period is specified on the front page of the solicitation. The Offeror shall make a clear statement that the proposal is valid until this date. The contractor shall agree to hold its offered prices firm for 120 days in accordance with Section A on page 1.</p>
<p>1.5 IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.8, the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals. Unless the Offeror requests otherwise, the Government will destroy extra copies.</p>
<p>1.6 The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the PCO's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional data will be requested under FAR 15.406-2. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit data other than cost or pricing to the extent necessary for the PCO to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price. <br /><br />2.0. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>2.1 Point of Contact<br />The PCO is the sole point of contact for this acquisition. Address any questions or concerns you may have to the PCO. Written requests for clarification may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at danah.ambrose@tinker.af.mil and the PCO at mark.melendez@tinker.af.mil. The only exception is submittal of Source Approval Request (SAR) packages. All SARs need to be submitted to OC-ALC/SB IAW clause 52.209-1. Only Offeror's qualified through the SAR process are eligible for award and award will not be held pending qualification. Only address any questions or concerns relating to the solicitation you may have to with the PCO.</p>
<p>2.2 Debriefings <br />The PCO will promptly notify Offerors of any decision to exclude them from the competitive range, whereupon they may request and receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505. Offerors excluded from the competitive range may request a pre-award debriefing or they may choose to wait until after the source selection decision to request a post-award debriefing. However, Offerors excluded from the competitive range are entitled to no more than one debriefing for each proposal. The PCO will notify unsuccessful Offerors in accordance with FAR 15.503. Upon such notification, unsuccessful Offerors may request and receive a debriefing. Offerors desiring a debriefing must make their request in accordance with the requirements of FAR 15.505 or 15.506, as applicable.</p>
<p>2.3 Discrepancies<br />If an Offeror believes that the requirements in these instructions contain an error, omission, or are otherwise unsound, the Offeror shall immediately notify the PCO in writing with supporting rationale as well as the remedies the Offeror is asking the PCO to consider as related to the omission or error. The Offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussions. This reservation includes matters of additional or substitute pages of the initial proposal.</p>

E-mail digital copies to Mark.Melendez@tinker.af.mil and to danah.ambrose@tinker.af.mil.</p>
<p>3.0. EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>3.1 Factor 1 - Technical <br />A formal technical proposal or volume is not required. Offerors shall propose IAW requirements in the Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs Section of the RFP - NSNs/P/Ns, Delivery, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs), warranty and all attachments herein. Your proposal will be evaluated IAW Addendum to FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Factors for Award, of the solicitation. All the requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory. By your proposal submission you are representing that your firm will perform all the requirements specified in the solicitation. <br /><br />4.0 Factor 2 - Price <br />Completion of the RFP, the Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs Section will represent the price proposal. Pricing information shall be addressed only in the Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs Section of the model contract, to include Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), and SubCLIN (SCLIN) level pricing, including unit and extended pricing. The Offeror shall provide the following information in addition to the pricing in the Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs Section of the RFP. These instructions are to assist you in submitting information required to evaluate the reasonableness of your proposed price. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal. Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your price position. All information relating to the proposed price including all required supporting documentation must be included in a separate cover letter with your proposal with the subject identified as "additional information." Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal.</p>
<p>4.1 Price Reasonableness and Balance<br />Offeror's proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance. Unreasonably low or high proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement. Additionally, unbalanced pricing may pose an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed costs/prices rests with the Offeror.</p>
<p>4.2 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements<br />FAR 12.209 gives the requirement to establish price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures), 14.408-2 (Sealed Bidding), or 15.4 (Contract Pricing by Negotiation), as applicable. FAR part 15 applies. IAW FAR 15.403-3-1(b), prices based on adequate price competition do not require submission of cost or pricing data. IAW FAR 15.403-3(a), however, information other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness. FAR 15.403-3(a)(1) provides for obtaining information other than cost or pricing data if needed to determine price reasonableness. Therefore, the FAR does not preclude the requirement for obtaining other than cost or pricing data under certain circumstances and the Government reserves the right to obtain data as appropriate. Should the PCO determine proposed prices to appear unreasonable or the possibility that an Offeror does not fully understand the requirement, the Offerors may be required to support price reasonableness via other than cost or pricing data. If, after receipt of proposals, the PCO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit cost or pricing data.</p>
<p>4.3 Rounding<br />All dollar amounts except line shall be rounded to the nearest penny.</p>
<p>5.0. CONTRACT DOCUMENTATION</p>
<p>5.1 Model Contract/Representations and Certifications <br />The purpose of this volume is to provide information to the Government for preparing the contract document and supporting file. The Offeror's proposal shall include a signed copy of the Model Contract, and Sections A through K.</p>
<p>5.2 Solicitation/Contract Form <br />Completion of blocks 12, 17 and signature and date for blocks 30a, 30b and 30c of the SF1449. Signature by the Offeror on the SF1449 constitutes an offer, which the Government may accept. The "original" copy should be clearly marked under separate cover and should be provided without any punched holes. The proposal acceptance period shall be specified as 120 days.</p>
<p>5.3 Supplies or Services and Costs/Prices (Section B)<br />All pricing information shall be addressed under the Section B of the model contract. Information shall be limited to CLIN, SCLIN or Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) level pricing, including unit and extended pricing as specified. Proposal shall be submitted in terms of U.S. dollars. Proposals received in other than U.S. dollars shall be rejected.</p>
<p>5.4 Contract Clauses (Section I)<br />The Offeror shall provide required information to complete clauses as required.</p>
<p>5.5 List of Attachments <br />The Offeror shall provide the following as attachments to the solicitation:<br />Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 (large businesses only)</p>
<p>5.6 Representations, Certifications, and other Statements of Offerors (Section K)<br />The Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov. After reviewing the ORCA database information, the Offeror verifies by submission of this offer that the representation and certifications currently posted electronically at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items are correct.</p>
<p>5.7 Exceptions to Solicitation Requirements<br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors, if stated. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. Each exception shall be specifically related to each paragraph and/or specific part of the solicitation to which the exception is taken. Provide rationale in support of the exception and fully explain its impact, if any, on the performance, schedule, cost, and specific requirements of the solicitation. This information shall be provided in the format and content of Table 5.7.</p>

<p>6.0 Other Information Required</p>
<p>6.1 Ombudsman <br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is OC-ALC/PKC. This does not diminish the authority of the program director or PCO, but communicates Offeror concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process; interested parties are invited to call OC-ALC/PKC at 405-736-3273.</p>

List all locations where work is to be performed and indicate whether such facility is a division, affiliate, or subcontractor, and the percentage of work to be performed at each location.</p>
<p>6.4. Subcontracting Plan<br />Include a Subcontracting Plan IAW FAR 19.702, if applicable. The plan must be approved by the PCO before contract award.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies.<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers:<br />1. Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement<br />2. Cost/Price<br />(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p>Technical and Price are of equal importance.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2<br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1.0. Source Selection (SS)</p>
<p>1.1. Basis for Contract Award</p>
<p>1.1.1. This acquisition will utilize Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection procedures, with technical proposals. Technical tradeoffs will not be made, and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the offeror who is rated "acceptable" in Factor 1 Technical and has the lowest evaluated cost or price, and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by FAR 52.212-1 and its Addendum of this solicitation). The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>1.1.2. While the Government Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the Source Selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>1.2. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for this acquisition. However, the Government reserves the right not to award a contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>1.3. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal aspect evaluated as "unacceptable". The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an Offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable or if the amount of corrections needed to meet the Government requirement is impractical, the Offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>1.4. Rejection of Unreasonable Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unreasonable in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions, or unreasonable cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program..</p>
<p>1.5. Competitive Range Determination<br />During the evaluation process multiple competitive range determinations may be made that eliminate Offerors from the competition. A competitive range determination may eliminate Offerors based on their initial proposal evaluation results, after discussions (if necessary), prior to issuance of the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) request or for efficiency. If Offerors are excluded from the competitive range they may request a debriefing IAW FAR 15.505.</p>
<p>2.0. Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>2.1.1. Evaluation factors used to evaluate each proposal:<br />Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. <br />Factor 1: Technical<br />Factor 2: Cost/Price</p>
<p>2.1.2. Evaluation Methodology:<br />The Government will evaluate all factors concurrently for all proposals. Initial ratings and evaluated price will be established for each offeror. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially, or as a result of discussions will be considered for award. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for Factor 1 Technical and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by FAR 52.212-1 and its Addendum of this solicitation).</p>
<p>2.2. Factor 1 - Technical<br />Each proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet any criteria will result in an unacceptable technical rating. The technical ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>2.3. Factor 3 - Cost or Price<br />The offeror's price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award) and all options. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(a)Total Evaluated Price. Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) as defined in Attachment 1, Pricing Matrix and Instructions.<br />(b)Reasonableness. The proposed prices will be evaluated for reasonableness. Analysis of cost/price proposals will be performed using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404 in order to determine price reasonableness. Reasonableness must represent a price to the Government a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.<br />(c)Unreasonable Costs or Prices. Unreasonable proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition, either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement, or the offeror has made an unreasonable proposal.<br />(d)Unbalanced Pricing. Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>2.4. Determination of Contractor Responsibility. <br />To be eligible for award, an offeror must be determined responsible. A Determination of Contractor Responsibility will be conducted in accordance with FAR 9.1. Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Offerors rated as satisfactory or neutral equals a determination of responsibility. Offerors rated as unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution. An offeror who receives a determination of non-responsibility will not be eligible to receive the contract award.</p>
<p>3.0. Discussions<br />The Government intends to award without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if necessary. Therefore, it is imperative that Offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the SS decision. If a Request for FPR is issued, offeror responses to ENs relating to Factor I Technical, Factor 2 Cost/Price, and Contracting must be included in the FPR in order to be considered in the final evaluation. Failure to include EN responses in the FPR may result in a final "unacceptable" technical rating, or otherwise make your company ineligible for award.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a Request for FPR is issued, Offeror responses to ENs for Past Performance shall not be included in the FPR. Offeror's responses to the Past Performance ENs during discussions will automatically be considered in the FPR evaluation.</p>
<p>3.1. Solicitation Requirements - Terms and Conditions<br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and mission requirements, in addition to those identified as factors. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the Offeror being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale. In the case that a discrepancy exists between the ITO and the Evaluation Factors for Award, the evaluation criteria in Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 will take precedence.</p>

If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis of Government obtained information, additional information in accordance with FAR 15.402(a) may be required from the offeror to support the proposed price.  Unreasonably low or high proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br>(2) Total Evaluated Price - The total evaluated price to be used for the determination of reasonableness will be calculated as follows:  <br>(i).The evaluated price for each CLIN is the unit price proposed for the CLIN multiplied by the quantity specified in the Schedule for that CLIN.   <br>(ii).The evaluated price for the "Option to Extend Services" will be calculated as follows:<br>	(1) Offerors are required only to price the base and option periods.

<DESC><p align="left">The HVAC system functions poorly. The building is served throughout by VAV supply diffusers (Thermafusers), each supply diffuser was designed to sense the space temperature at its location and vary the airflow accordingly. This building is 30 years old and these are most probably original equipment (the design did not always function as intended 30 years ago). The mechansms within the units do not function. <br /><br />Reommendations:<br />Provide desgn and construction services to replace the HVAC air distribution system only.&nbsp; Using as much existing duct as possible procure a traditional VAV system including a VFD for the evaporator fan motor controlled by a duct pressure sensor.&nbsp; Modify the existing power supply as require to conform with the manfacturer's recommendatios and the NEC.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. <br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is 465-12MR-1815-1 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-56.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541380, Testing Laboratories. This requirement is unrestricted and only qualified Offerors will be considered.</p>
<p>The following items are being sought:<br />CLIN DESCRIPTION QUANTITY UNIT<br />0001 Air jet sieving of rock dust- Quantity of 40 (EA)<br />0002 Sample prep (drying and riffling)- Quantity of 40 (EA)</p>
<p>All Contract Line Items (CLINS) are to be priced in accordance with the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Mine Safety and Health Administration<br />Statement of Work<br />Particle Size Analysis Testing (Air Jet Sieving)</p>
<p>1.0 Description of Services<br />MSHA is seeking the services of an independent lab to perform air jet sieving particle size analysis of limestone dust in accordance with ASTM Standard C110-11, Section 18.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />Testing is required for samples taken from manufactured material at various underground coal mining operations across the country. The limestone material (rock dust) is applied to underground mine surfaces to safeguard against coal-dust explosions. Federal regulations mandate that 100 percent of the manufactured rock dust material will pass through a sieve having 20 meshes per linear inch and 70 percent or more of which will pass through a sieve having 200 meshes per linear inch.</p>
<p>3.0 Testing and Analysis<br />3.1 Sampling will include approximately 40 samples of limestone material (rock dust). For this set of samples, we are interested in the determination of the amount of material that passes through a 200 mesh sieve. The analysis of these samples has become a high priority so turnaround time is important.</p>
<p>3.1.1 Samples delivered will range in weight from approximately 100 grams to 1 pound.</p>
<p>3.2 The contractor shall maintain appropriate chain-of-custody, including associated paperwork at all times.</p>
<p>3.3 An ISO/CEN 17025 certified contractor is preferred. If possible, sieve testing should be among the fields of testing covered by the scope of the accreditation.</p>
<p>3.4 Quality assurance analysis such as duplicate sample determinations, balance calibration verification, and sieve performance (most importantly the minus 200 mesh) are to be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>3.4.1 A duplicate analysis is to be completed on every tenth sample and reported.</p>
<p>3.4.2 The analytical balances used to weigh the samples must be routinely checked and verified using ASTM certified check weights.</p>
<p>3.4.3 The performance of the 200 mesh sieve(s) must be verified using a NIST traceable standard material (RM 8010, D) after every twenty samples.</p>
<p>3.5 Analysis is to be performed using ASTM's C110 air jet sieving through 200 mesh sieves.</p>
<p>4.0 Testing Methods</p>
<p>4.1 Testing is to be done according to ISO/IEC 17025 standards and ASTM Standard C110-11, Section 18, Dry Screening of Hydrated Lime, Pulverized Quicklime, and Limestone by Air Jet Sieving.</p>
<p>4.2 It may be necessary to dry samples after prolonged periods of storage.</p>
<p>5.0 Contractor Provided Items and Services<br />The contractor shall provide the following items and services to the government, to the parties/locations indicated:</p>
<p>5.1 Sample analyses reports to be provided within 30 calendar days of sample receipt. Electronic reports shall be in Adobe Acrobat format, digitally signed and e-mailed to: wesolowski.mark@dol.gov.</p>
<p>6.0 Government Provided Items and Services</p>
<p>6.1 The government shall provide the labor and equipment needed to obtain and document the samples, including delivery of the samples to the contractor or shipping company drop off point.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Parts 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 of the SOW. Each proposal must contain information adequate to allow the Government to make a determination that the vendor can perform the work identified in the SOW.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a separate document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 9:00 AM (EST) on April 16, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov. Electronic quotes must be submitted in a format compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 or Adobe. No specific format is required, however your proposal pricing must be sent as a separate file and include the contract line items listed above. All questions on this requirement must be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contract Specialist by April 12, 2012 at 9:00 AM (EST). Phone calls will not be accepted.</p>

The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, located in Kennesaw, GA, has a requirement to remove hazardous and potentially hazardous trees throughout the park.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561730 and the size standard is $7 million.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  
Statement of Services1.0 Project Site: Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, 905 Kennesaw Mountain Drive, Kennesaw, GA, 30152.2.0 Background:  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park preserves a Civil War battleground of the Atlanta Campaign.  The battle was fought here from June 18, 1864 until July 2, 1864.  There are 3 battlefield areas at the park: The Visitor Center including the top of Kennesaw Mountain, off Burnt Hickory Road and the main site is located at Cheatham Hill.  The visitor center provides introductory information about the park and the battle.While walking some of the 18+ miles of interpretive walking trails you will see historic earthworks, cannon emplacements and various interpretive signs.  There are 3 monuments representing states that fought here. Kennesaw Mountain is 1808 feet above sea level.  It is approximately a 700 foot incline from the Visitor Center to the mountain's summit.  The hike up is approximately 1.4 miles on the road and 1.2 mile up the trail.  Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park was authorized for protection by the War Department in 1917 and was transferred to the Department of the Interior as a unit of the National Park System in 1933.  The 2992+- acre park includes the site of some of the heaviest fighting of the Atlanta Campaign.  The park was set aside as an important cultural property dedicated to public inspiration and interpretation of the significant historic events that occurred here.3.0 General Statement of Work:  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to establish a contract for the removal of hazardous and potentially hazardous trees and limbs at various locations within Kennesaw Mountain Nation Battlefield Park.  The work will be ordered, as needed by the National Park Service (NPS) approximately once per month.  Trees will range from 10 inches to 37+ inches in diameter and up to 100+ feet high.  Trees will need to be cut down and debris chipped and/or moved 60 feet from park boundaries, roads, parking lots and trails as order by the NPS.  Tree stumps shall be cut at ground level.  Park employees will mark 25+- to 40+- trees each month to be removed.  A total of about 400+- trees will need to be removed.  This contract will last 10 to 12 months. Contractor will start work in middle to late 2012 and finish in 2013.3.1 Work Descriptions:Tree Removal:  Removed trees and debris shall be fallen safely to prevent injury of workers and/or visitors using the adjacent areas.  When ordered by the NPS, tree debris and limbs will be chipped and hauled to a NPS approved area for disposal.  When chipping is not ordered by the NPS, the contractor will spread tree debris and limbs evenly across the area of disposal.  The contractor may harvest large trees and limbs that they actively remove.  Salvaged wood, should the contractor choose to re-utilize the material, will be removed immediately after felling, chipping and bucking of individual trees.  Removed/harvested trees are the property of the contractor.  Trail Trimming:  Temporary trail closures of one hour or less are permissible for public safety reasons.  Closures longer than one hour must be scheduled and approved by the NPS prior to closure and the commencement of the work.  Special care must be taken to prevent damage to the surrounding area or adjacent trees, brush and other vegetation.  The contractor will post appropriate warning signs indicating the removal process is underway.Limb Trimming:  The contractor may be required to trim the area prism of large limbs and other overhead (or horizontal) obstacles that could prevent the safe use of those roads, parking lots, trails or adjacent public use areas.  The area prism also includes horizontal limbs or obstructions that protrude into the vertical plane from the trail tread sides, roads, parking lots or adjacent public use areas.  Climbing of trees may be required to accomplish some trimming work.Desired Results:  With the completion of the tree and limb removal project at Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, trees and limbs order by the NPS shall be removed and/or chipped and spread in the area of disturbance and the worksites will show little indication of that removal.  Stumps ultimately shall be cut at ground level.  Park boundaries, roads, parking lots and trails will be free of hazardous trees that may interfere with safe use of those areas.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>COCO ALERT 08-33: Attachment 1 - NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the U.S. Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific U.S. Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>USCG ALC<br />1664 Weeksville Road<br />SRR Hangar 75, HSCG38-12-R-200013<br />Attn: Luis Mojica<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<CONTACT>Angela E. Mattox, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-767-6676, Email angela.mattox@dla.mil
<DESC>This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/ Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the acquisition of research and development in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016 Broad agency announcement, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. No formal solicitation will be issued. Only the information provided in this notice is available. Requests for same shall be disregarded. It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. <br /><br />1. BACKGROUND<br /><br />The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Branch is charged with conducting research and development in all areas relevant to the DLA mission and across all DLA supply chains. DLA defines its current R&amp;D requirements each year and seeks funding for them through the Department of Defense&rsquo;s Program Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. These planned-for requirements produce a robust logistics R&amp;D program addressing areas such as energy readiness, combat rations, uniform manufacturing, shelters, casting and forging, weapon system sustainment, medical logistics and electronics availability. Despite these ongoing efforts, other R&amp;D requirements arise each year that could not have been anticipated and were not budgeted. <br /><br />DLA&rsquo;s need for this &ldquo;Emergent (R&amp;D) Requirements BAA&rdquo; stems from the appearance of these unplanned-for R&amp;D requirements that are not addressed by the PPBE process. Most of these requirements are in the form of additional research areas (beyond those funded by DLA&rsquo;s President&rsquo;s Budget request) added by Congress to the DLA R&amp;D appropriation each year. Other emergent requirements come from DLA in the course of the year. These requirements can address virtually any logistics-related R&amp;D topic and each year generally presents a mixture of new projects and new funding on prior years&rsquo; congressionally directed efforts. <br /><br />2. AREAS OF INTEREST <br /><br />The particular emergent requirements that are the subject of this BAA are:&nbsp;<br /><br />Distribution and Reutilization Operations <br /><br />(a) Technologies to improve the velocity, visibility, and value of distribution services provided by the agency, through its DLA Distribution field activity, to the military services.<br /><br />(b) Technologies to improve the effectiveness and return on investment for the reutilization services provided by the agency, through its&nbsp;DLA Disposition Services&nbsp;field activity, to the military services in the 2050 timeframe. <br /><br />Medical Logistics <br /><br />(a)&nbsp;Applications of existing technologies to identify and resolve medical logistics support challenges at low cost.&nbsp; The technologies should leverage existing commercial capablilities and use a Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) delivery model.&nbsp; Efforts should be directed to the following topics: <br /><br />(i)&nbsp; Data Analytics<br />(ii) Fair and Reasonable Pricing<br />(iii)&nbsp; Medical Product Standardization (considering clinical attributes)&nbsp;<br /><br />(b) Evaluation or development of products or services that will integrate commercial supply chain best practices, and forging of strategic partnerships with critical customers, manufacturers, suppliers and other Federal stakeholders and industry groups.&nbsp; Initiative should enhance medical logistics capabilities in peacetime and operational environments.&nbsp; Products are limited to non-pharmaceutical classes.&nbsp; Services may include technologies not employing a Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) delivery model but must be compatible with existing Information Technology framework in support of DLA Medical.<br /><br />3. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION <br /><br />DLA requests interested parties to submit an initial synopsis, commonly referred to as "white paper." White papers may be based on fundamental R&amp;D; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based acquisition; integrated data environments and product data managers; and development of operational systems. <br /><br />Any responsible source capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper which shall be considered by DLA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit white papers and join others in submitting white papers; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.<br /><br />4. WHITE PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS <br /><br />(a) White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA. Offerors may submit white papers via email to the following address: <a href="mailto:Angela.mattox@dla.mil">Angela.mattox@dla.mil</a> or regular mail to the follow address: Ms. Angela Mattox, DLA Contract Services Office (DCSO-H), 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-6221. <br /><br />(b) The white paper shall not exceed 5 pages. The white paper shall include a title, BAA number, offeror name, area of interest, technical description of the effort, identification of risks, project duration, preliminary schedule, and approximate cost. A brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must be provided in the white paper. The items listed below must be address in the white paper. <br /><br />(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merits of the Proposed Effort: Offerors shall propose a project that includes: (a) The improved logistics capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Logistics Support process; (b) Clear description of problem being addressed and tasks to be performed and deliverables to be provided; (c) Realism of (a) and (b) above. <br /><br />(2) Potential Relevance and Contributions to the Area of Interest: Offerors shall propose a project that (a) address the applications of the technology; and (b) how the technology will address long and short term needs of the Department of Defense and the expected benefits. <br /><br />(3) New and Creative Solutions, Technical Data and Computer Software: Offerors shall propose new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest. Offerors shall address any technical data or computer software that may be developed under the proposed effort and whether delivery to the Government will be with unrestricted rights. <br /><br />(4) Experience/Past Performance: Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program. Offerors shall provide the two largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program. Offerors shall include at least two (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. <br /><br />(5) Organizational and Project Management: Offerors shall provide evidence of how the contract shall be managed and show that its organizational structure shall ensure performance stability, reliable customer service and commitment to DLA and this project for the duration of the contract performance period. Offerors shall provide information pertaining to the qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader or other key personnel with relevant qualifications and experience that is critical in achieving the proposal objectives. <br /><br />(6) Cost Information: Offerors shall provide a rough estimate of all of the costs related to the project task including direct labor and indirect costs. Offerors proposing cost sharing must clearly explain the portion of the cost proposed to be absorbed by the offeror and the expected substantial compensating benefits. <br /><br />5. EVALUATION FACTORS<br /><br />The white paper and any proposal received will be evaluated using the evaluation criteria below. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />Factor 1: Overall Scientific and Technical Merits of the Proposed Effort: Will be evaluated for the degree to which the proposed effort improves logistic support. <br /><br />Factor 2: Potential Relevance and Contributions to the Area of Interest: Will be evaluated based on the degree to which the propose technology meet short and long term needs of DoD and provide a benefit to DoD. <br /><br />Factor 3: New and Creative Solutions, Technical Data and Computer Software: Will be evaluated based on the degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights. <br /><br />Factor 4: Experience/Past Performance: Will be evaluated based on the degree to which the capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objective will successfully accomplish the area of interest. <br /><br />Factor 5: Organizational and Project Management: Will be evaluated based on the degree to how the contract shall be managed, how the proposed organizational structure will ensure performance stability and reliable customer service, and the degree to which the proposed key personnel will successfully accomplish the objectives within the area of interest. <br /><br />Factor 6: Cost Realism: The cost realism will include a rough estimate of all of<br />the cost information related to the Project Task, including direct labor and indirect costs. A cost realism analysis will be performed in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). Realism will be based on an evaluation of the offeror&rsquo;s cost estimate to determine whether the estimated cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the offeror&rsquo;s white paper. <br /><br />6. WHITE PAPER SELECTION <br /><br />The Government may select white papers that are most promising for further consideration. White papers for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority will receive no further consideration. <br /><br />7. TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to request full technical and cost proposals from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Any such request for full technical and cost proposals does not guarantee award. Decisions to select fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability and the merits of the proposals. Additionally, to be eligible for a potential award of a contract, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems under cost type contracts, ability to comply with performance schedules, prior record of past performance, integrity, organizational structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment in accordance with FAR Part 9. Selectable proposals may be considered for funding up to a five-year period. Note: While it is the Government&rsquo;s intent to issue a cost plus fixed fee, cost or cost sharing type contract for selected proposals, the Government reserves the right to award a fixed price contract when it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. <br /><br />Note: Evaluation factors cited in Section 5 will be used to evaluate full technical and cost proposals. <br /><br />8. SMALL BUSINESS/SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN <br />Large Business concerns will be required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan if their white paper is selected for further consideration. For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard for Small Business is fewer than 500 employees. <br /><br />9.

<DESC><p>27. For the training courses listed in the Solicitation that run from 1.0 to 4.0 hours, does the NIH plan on issuing task orders for a combination of classes that when combined, represent a normal 8-hour work day, or must the contractor price out individual courses on a stand alone basis, ie. assuming that on any given day only a single under 8-hr. class will be delivered?</p>
<p>- The NIH intends to award task orders on a quarterly basis. In it, those 1 to 4 hour classes may be included; however may or may not be performed on the same day. Courses to be held will in that task order will be coordinated with the contractor well in advance to the course being performed. The couses are to be priced out individually on a stand alone basis.</p>
<p>28. In regards to the solicitation, can you please tell me if the following CLIN Items require certifications or just the required numbers of hours in training:</p>
<p><br />CLIN 0002 - Bucket Op Training<br />CLIN 0014 - Hoist &amp; Crane Rigger Training<br />CLIN 0015 - Hoist &amp; Crane Inspection Training<br />CLIN 0016 - KubotaTunnel Cart Training</p>
<p>- Only training with OSHA requirements require certification. The other training requires the number of hours of training as indicated in this solicitation<br /><br />29. The RFP states four copies to be submitted but does not specify if they can be submitted electronically. Can they be submitted electronically?</p>
<p>- Because the RFP did not specify this previously, electronic copies will be accepted.  They must be in either Microsoft Word or PDF format only.  If you are submitting hard copies, please submit to the address listed in the PDF copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />30. Must we submit the multiple referenced certifications or may we submit a letter confirming that we will comply with all of the selected ones?</p>
<p>- Proof/verification of the multiple referenced certifications needs to be included in the proposal submission.  Copies would be nice, but a letter confirming compliance will be acceptable.</p>

Questions & Answers pertaning to the requirement:
Q: Is there a fork lift available to unload the shipment when it arrives in San Diego? Is there a staging area to do the assembly and how close is it to the installed location?  A:There's a forklift available and we have a bay with more than enough space for the assembly.  The assembly area will be no more than 50feet from where the lockers will ultimately sit. Q: I had a couple of question about the placement of the lockers. Are the lockers going to be side by side, back to back or individually placed? Are the lockers going to be placed on the ground floor?  A:The lockers will be side by and back to back.  The lockers will be placed on wooden pallets to make it easier for future movement.
Q: does the customer want an expanded metal locker and door with a wire top or do they want   wire panel, sides, top and door with expanded metal shelves? Also if we need 3 evenly spaced shelves are they on one-half of the locker and the other side left open so equipment can hang on the opposite side?A:  The sides of the locker need to be wire panels same as the top; this is to prevent the theft of material in it.  There are 3 spaced shelves on the right side of the lockers so that personnel can put the smaller items while the left side is open for the exception of the rod to use to hang uniforms etc. 

Q: Can  pre-assembled units be included?A: The units can be pre-assembled and we will take care of moving them around the building.
Q: Is it possible to post a drawing of the type of locker/cabinet requested?
A: See attachment
Q: The sketch provided does not show a bottom for the lockers. Is a bottom required or is it open?     Wire comes in welded and/or woven. Does the customer have a preference?  
A: Bottom is required. The wire should be welded.
Q: If the units are shipped assembled are there any other requirements?  
A: As long as they are protected against damage when they are shipped there is nothing else of concern., 30, EA;<BR>LI 002, ON SITE ASSEMBLY, 30, EA;<BR><BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9uYXi2EKv3qhQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments</a><BR><BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: <br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 4:30 PM EST&nbsp;Friday April 13th, 2012; Deadline for questions will be Wednesday April 11th,&nbsp;2012 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC><strong>Additional Comments on CRH Draft RFP Documents<br /><br /></strong>As discussed during the draft RFP (DRFP) walk-through on 20 Mar 12, the DRFP includes system specifications (SS) for both the Aircraft and the Training System. When the final RFP is released, the system specifications, as well as the SOW, will be in final form. The offeror will be required with their proposal submittal to accept these documents as contained in the final RFP without any changes (reference Section M, paras 2.3.5 and 2.3.6). <br /><br />Now is the opportunity for you to question any requirement and standards in these documents. Your input was specifically requested on 20 Mar 12 to provide alternative standards in which your baseline aircraft was developed to meet. The USAF could evaluate and potentially incorporate these documents. If you have not provided these inputs and would like to do so, please send an email to the CRH mailbox indicating your intention. These comments need to be submitted as quickly as possible for the USAF to have the ability to evaluate them and incorporate them, if appropriate, into the final RFP.<br /><br />Also attached are two answers to questions submitted about the CRH Draft RFP.

<a href="mailto:michael.c.mctague@kuwait.swa.army.mil">Qatar Contracting Command (PARC SWA, 408th CSB)</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Qatar proposes to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with at least 3 firms for the subject requirement. Each furniture requirement will be competed amongst the 3 BPA holders (contractors). A Call Order against the BPA may require the contractor to 1) develop a floor plan and design based on the Government's furniture requirement and facility space, and 2) provide, deliver and install a variety of furniture items for locations and facilities in Qatar.<br>2. Specific items the Government may require during the life of the BPA are contained in the attached Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) Schedule. You may add items to this list with pictures, and you can also offer items via your website with a virtual online catalog showing prices, pictures and description. Your prices should be as low as or lower than those charged your most favored customers, including any discounts for prompt payment and delivery. Pricing for the period of performance of this agreement shall not be revised unless authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br>3. The general terms and conditions of the proposed BPA are contained in the attached solicitation. Please keep in mind that a BPA is not a binding contract. Instead, a BPA is an agreement - in this case, an agreement with the U.S. Army. Since it is an agreement and not a contract, either party may choose to terminate the agreement provided a 30-day notification is given to the other party, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<br><br>The solicitation will be released in the near future. The ELIN structure provided will be the bulk of the submittal requirement.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information Outreach and Collection Activities under the Affordable Care Act (Previously RFI Regarding Reinsurance Program under ACA)
<SOLNBR>HHS-CMS-DBSC-RFI-11-621
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>042512
<CONTACT>Brian J Humes, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-787-8898, Email brian.humes@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><p><strong>Request for Information for Outreach and Collection Activities Under the Affordable Care Act<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUMMARY:</span></strong> This is a revision of the request for information (RFI) published on December 16, 2011. It has been determined that the Federal government can utilize for-profit entities when the Department of Health and Human Services operates the transitional reinsurance program on behalf of a State. In order to streamline internal processes, this RFI seeks to gain market information on entities that could perform operational functions when HHS operates a transitional reinsurance program on behalf of a State. These functions include outreach and collection of contributions for a transitional reinsurance program, and reconciliation and invoicing for over-payments, charges and user fees for the Federal Exchange Programs System (see Appendix A for detailed information). This RFI will inform one or more future Requests for Proposals (RFP). <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DATES:</span></strong> Submit written or electronic comments by <strong>April 25, 2012.</strong> <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></strong> The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 was enacted to assist millions of Americans in obtaining affordable health care services and to allow more employers to offer insurance coverage in a cost effective manner to their employees. The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for management and oversight of the Affordable Care Act. Within CMS, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) has been created to ensure successful implementation, and adherence to, the specific provisions of the legislation. The final rule, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Standards Related to Reinsurance, Risk Corridors and Risk Adjustment [CMS-9975-F], for the various premium stabilization programs was issued on March 23, 2012, and can be found at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS_FRDOC_0001-0448.<br />The financial management program functions reside within CMS/CCIIO's Payment Policy and Financial Management Group (PPFMG). PPFMG's programs and responsibilities include collections of contributions for the reinsurance program; calculations and disbursement of payments for the reinsurance program; calculation and disbursement of payments/collection of charges for the risk corridor and risk adjustment programs; user fee collections for the risk adjustment program and Federally-Facilitated Exchange (FFE) operations; monthly processing and reconciliation of advance payments of the premium tax credits (APTCs) and cost sharing reductions (CSRs); and, remitting monthly aggregated payments. This RFI focuses on the collections of contributions required for the reinsurance program, as well as, reconciliation and invoicing for over-payments, charges and user fees in all of the PPFMG operational areas as identified above.<br />This RFI solicits information from entities that could perform all actions pertaining to collections within the transitional reinsurance program, including, but not limited to, outreach to issuers, self insured plans and third party administrators (TPAs) required to contribute to the reinsurance program and State's reinsurance entities; review and reconciliation of reinsurance funds; allocation and tracking of allocated funds; reporting of reinsurance collections/allocations/discrepancies; and, fund distribution to states managing their own reinsurance program. <br />In addition, this RFI solicits entities that could manage the invoicing and collections process for all of the PPFMG functions, to include, but not limited to, outstanding reinsurance contributions, outstanding risk adjustment user fees, FFE operations user fees, improper payments and charges. For all tasks mentioned, the following items would need to be completed: periodic reporting, ensure all collections transactions are securely documented, and that all collections transactions are validated within the system. All processes would require interaction and coordination with other Federal agencies, as well as, other CMS/CCIIO contractors. <br /><br /><strong><em>For further information on all programs for this RFI, please refer to Appendix A. <br /></em></strong><br />We note that responses to this RFI are not offers, and cannot be accepted by the Federal government to form a binding contract or to issue a grant. The purpose of this RFI is to inform one or more Requests for Proposals. Information obtained in response to this RFI may be used by the Federal government for program planning and development, or other purposes with or without attribution. Do not include any information that might be considered proprietary or confidential. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></span> This RFI seeks comment from entities that can perform outreach, collections, invoicing, bookkeeping, and reporting activities. CMS may enter into one or more contracts to fulfill the statutory, regulatory, and operational requirements of the programs established under section 1341 of the ACA depending on the workload and number of States that would require assistance. In such a case, the contractor may be tasked with one or more of the following functions: <br /><br />&bull; Outreach to the insurance market for the reinsurance program; <br />&bull; Collections and allocations (internal and external to the Federal government) of reinsurance contributions and user fees, to include remitting insurance market contributions to States when applicable;<br />&bull; Validation of issuer self-reported data; <br />&bull; Reconciling of expected/reported vs. actual monies remitted for contributions and invoices;<br />&bull; Invoicing management to include monitoring for paid/unpaid invoiced amounts and/or contributions and user fees;<br />&bull; Debt collection activities per the Federal debt collection process;<br />&bull; Bookkeeping for all collections, to include contributions allocations and receipt of invoiced amounts; <br />&bull; Periodic and ad-hoc reporting; and, <br />&bull; Providing customer support to issuers for collections and invoicing.</p>
<p>CMS is seeking to engage formally, in a transparent and participatory manner, with entities that understand outreach and collections, and would be able to perform the responsibilities under the statute and associated regulations. In carrying out these activities, CMS seeks to mitigate conflicts of interest (COI) that may arise if potential market competitors perform the outreach and collection activities. As such, we request any information on potential COIs, and potential avenues for mitigation, from all stakeholders, including issuers and third-party administrators. <br /><br /><strong><em>INFRASTRUCTURE<br /></em></strong><br />(1) Does your organization operate nationally or in limited geographic areas?

<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">APPENDIX A: <br /></span></strong>The following is a brief overview of the FEPS and the programs contained within.</p>
<p><strong><em>Federal Exchange Programs System Overview<br /></em></strong>An Exchange is a State-based competitive marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase affordable private health insurance. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and each State has the opportunity to tailor its Exchange to meet its needs. Exchanges will serve as a one-stop shop where individuals will get information about their options, be assessed for eligibility for the Exchange, tax credits for private insurance, or programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program, and enrolled in the plan of their choice. Small businesses will also have the option to purchase insurance through a program, the Small Group Health Options Program (SHOP), offered by each Exchange. For States that choose not to run an Exchange, HHS will run one on their behalf, known as the Federally-Facilitated Exchange (FFE). The data processing activities required to run the FFE, support State-based Exchanges (SBEs) and to operate programs associated with the FFE and SBE is known as the Federal Exchange programs system (FEPS).</p>
<p>The main functions of an Exchange, laid out in the Affordable Care Act, include:<br />&bull; Certifying, recertifying, and decertifying health plans offering coverage through the Exchange, called qualified health plans;<br />&bull; Assigning ratings to each plan offered through the Exchange on the basis of relative quality and price;<br />&bull; Providing consumer information on qualified health plans in a standardized format;<br />&bull; Creating an electronic calculator to allow consumers to assess the cost of coverage after application of any advance premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions;<br />&bull; Operating an internet website and toll-free telephone hotline offering comparative information on qualified health plans and allowing consumers to apply for and purchase coverage if eligible;<br />&bull; Determining eligibility for the Exchange, tax credits and cost-sharing reductions for private insurance, and other public health coverage programs, and facilitating enrollment of eligible individuals in those programs;<br />&bull; Determining exemption from requirements on individuals to carry health insurance, granting approvals to individuals relating to hardship or other exemptions; and,<br />&bull; Establishing a Navigator program to assist consumers in making choices about their health care options and accessing their new health care coverage, including access to premium tax credits for some consumers.</p>
<p>The following provides additional information for some of the processes and programs associated with the implementation of Exchanges and Exchange-related programs:</p>
<p><strong><em>Enrollment Data Interchanges with Issuers and States<br /></em></strong>When an individual enrolls in the FFE, the FFE will send an enrollment transaction to the relevant issuer. Monthly, issuers and the FFE will exchange full enrollment files to verify the integrity of the enrollment transaction processing. When an individual enrolls in an SBE, the SBE will send the routine enrollment transaction to the relevant issuer, but will also send a copy of the enrollment transaction to the FEPS. Those transactions will be used to create a national master file of all Exchange enrollees in the FFE and all SBEs housed in the FEPS. This master file will be used in SBE and FFE enrollment application processing to determine if an existing enrollment needs to be terminated to execute a new enrollment. It will also be used to support the processing of Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and Cost Sharing Reductions (CSRs) for monthly payment from the FEPS to issuers.</p>
<p><strong><em>APTCs and CSRs<br /></em></strong>The APTC will assist qualifying Individuals participating in the Exchange with premium payment amounts while the CSR will control and limit the cost burden for out-of-pocket spending for qualifying Individuals. The Exchange will determine the APTC and/or CSR of the qualifying Individual. The Exchange will record and submit this information to CMS via a transactional 834 so that monthly payments can be made on behalf of the qualifying Individual to the Issuer. CMS will also provide the Exchange with information regarding the payments made. The Issuers will receive monthly payments and monthly payment reports.</p>
<p><strong><em>Premium Payments<br /></em></strong>The Exchange will collect monthly premium payment amounts from Employers participating in SHOP. The collected premiums will be aggregated and distributed to Issuers along with a monthly payment report. The Exchange will also track and reconcile any unpaid premiums for which it is responsible for collecting.</p>
<p><strong><em>User Fees<br /></em></strong>Two types of user fees will be collected to support Exchange and Risk Adjustment operations. User fees will be collected from participating Issuers in the Exchange in order to cover the administrative costs associated with Exchange and Risk Adjustment operations. The participating Issuers will be invoiced based on an assessment formulate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reinsurance<br /></em></strong>The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary three-year program that runs from January 2014 through December 2016, with potential residual operational activities through 2018. Under statute, all health insurance issuers, including self-insured group health plans, must contribute a specified amount to support reinsurance payments to individual market issuers that cover high-cost individuals in non-grandfathered plans. The Affordable Care Act directs States to establish or enter into contract with one or more non-for-profit reinsurance entities to carry out a transitional reinsurance program. The final rule published in March 2012 clarifies that States, regardless of whether they establish an Exchange, may choose to establish a transitional reinsurance program or have HHS operate the program on behalf of the State State. The final rule also states that HHS will collect reinsurance contributions from all self-insured plans regardless of whether the program is established by HHS or the State. In addition, when the State runs its own reinsurance program, the State can elect for HHS to collect the fully-insured market contributions on behalf of the State. In the HHS-operated program, payables for reinsurance are assessed by using individual-market data provided by eligible issuers. Payables are determined by HHS's reinsurance parameters that consist of an attachment point, cap and contribution rate. After payments have been determined, the payment and a payment report will be sent to the Issuer. State-operated programs have the option of using the HHS parameters, or designing a specific set of parameters for use in their State.</p>
<p><strong><em>Risk Adjustment<br /></em></strong>The risk adjustment program is a permanent program beginning in January 2014 that will be applicable for the individual and small group markets inside and outside of the Exchange. The risk adjustment program protects health insurance Issuers in the individual and small group market that attract higher than average risk populations. Under this program, charges are assessed to Issuers with lower than average risk enrollees, and payments are made to Issuers with higher than average risk enrollees. The Federal government will specify the federally certified risk adjustment model to be used to determine the risk levels of the plans. The charges and payments are determined by using individual and small group data provided by eligible issuers. Utilizing this risk adjustment model, CMS will assess the actuarial risk of plans, compare it to the State average actuarial risk, and determine charges and payments. This program is designed to be budget neutral, with payments to higher-risk plans equaling charges received from lower-risk plans.</p>
<p><strong><em>Risk Corridors<br /></em></strong>The risk corridor program is a temporary three -year program from January 2014 through December 2016 that is applicable to qualified health plans (QHPs) offered inside and outside of the Exchange. Under this program, the Federal government shares profits and losses with plans, thus insulating those plans against unexpected risk due to inaccurate rate setting. Data for risk corridors will be collected from the State, the Exchange, and Issuers. This data will be used to determine the profits and losses of QHP issuers.</p>
<p>The programs described above require financial transfers occurring periodically between different parties. <strong>These parties may include States, Reinsurance Entities, Exchanges, CMS, Issuers, and Employers, as well as, any other designated CMS contractors.</strong></p>

<DESC>This modification changes the classification code from "Z - Maintenance, Repair or Alteration of Real Property" to "Y - Construction of Structures and Facilities."  This modification also replaces paragraph 5 of the original pre-solicitation notice's description (N3319112R0400) in its entirety.

Delete paragraph 5 of the original pre-solicitation notice and replace with the following: 

This solicitation will utilize a two-phase best-value tradeoff acquisition process.  The evaluation factors and phases are as follows: 

Phase I: 
Factor 1 â€“ Technical Approach
Factor 2 â€“ Experience 
Factor 3 â€“ Past Performance

Phase II: 
Factor 4 â€“ Safety
Factor 5 â€“ Technical Solution
Factor 6 â€“ Energy and Sustainable Design

This Two-Phase design-build (DB) procurement will result in the award of up to five (5) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts under a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) structure for a one year base period with provisions for the exercise of four one-year option periods.

For Two-Phase DB procurements, Factors 1-3 will be evaluated in Phase I and Factors 4-6 will be evaluated in Phase II.
  Factor 1 will only be rated Acceptable or Unacceptable.  If an Offeror is rated Unacceptable in Factor 1, then they will not be considered for Phase II.  In making the best value award decision after Phase II, the government will consider Factors 2-6 and price.  The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is that technical factors are equal to each other and when combined are equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance).  The combined non-cost/price factors are approximately equal to price.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I. INTRODUCTION: <br /></strong></span>This announcement describes a revolutionary research program, "Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning" to be launched under the ONRBAA12-001, Long Range Broad Agency Announcement for Navy and Marine Corps Science and Technology which can be found at http://www.onr.navy.mil/Contracts-Grants/Funding-Opportunities/Broad-Agency-Announcements.aspx. The research opportunity described in this announcement specifically falls under numbered paragraphs 5 of the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare &amp; Combating Terrorism Department (Code 30) sub section and 1 of the Warfighter Performance Human and Bioengineered Systems (Code 34) subsection. The submission of proposals, their evaluation and the placement of basic research contracts and grants will be carried out as described in that Broad Agency Announcement. <br />The purpose of this announcement is to focus the attention of the scientific community on (1) the area to be studied, and (2) the planned timetable for the submission of white papers and full proposals. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">II. TOPIC DESCRIPTION: <br /></span></strong>Research in human pattern recognition and decision-making suggest that there is a "sixth sense" through which humans can detect and act on unique patterns without consciously and intentionally analyzing them. Evidence is accumulating that this capability, known as intuition or intuitive decision making, enables the rapid detection of patterns in ambiguous, uncertain and time restricted information contexts, that it informs the decision making process and, most importantly, that it may not require domain expertise to be effective. These properties make intuition a strong candidate for further exploration as the basis for developing a new set of decision support training technologies.<br />The proposed topic will lead to new insights into intuitive decision making, and develop new approaches for enhancing this process. The proposed topic will do this by: <br />&bull; Characterizing the nature of intuition at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels in order to develop approaches to train &amp; measure it<br />&bull; Developing a computational cognitive model of intuition, in order to facilitate the delivery of scenario based training to enhance intuitive decision making<br />&bull; Demonstrating that implicit learning techniques, guided by these models and embedded in a scenario based training technology, can enhance intuitive decision making in non-experts, in order to increase baseline abilities to make more effective decisions under conditions in which information is ambiguous, and time to analyze is restricted <br />The program will pursue a wide variety of approaches that address four challenges that are key to understanding and enhancing intuitive decision making: 1) Combining advances in measuring performance at multiple representation levels (e.g, neural, cognitive &amp; behavioral) with advances in simulation - based paradigms for assessing decision making to understand the foundations of intuitive decision making; 2) Leveraging advances in cognitive modeling and machine learning techniques to represent individual intuitive decision making processes; 3) Developing an implicit learning based approach for enhancing intuitive decision making; and, 4) Combining these efforts, through scenario/simulation based training, to test and validate the hypothesis that implicit learning can enhance intuitive decision making for one or more operationally valid tasks.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background: <br /></span>This topic outlines four challenges that must be addressed in order to develop training technologies for intuitive decision making. First, the nature of intuitive decision making must be characterized, at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels. Second, these characterizations must be integrated into a single model, providing the foundation for developing adaptive and individualized training technologies. Third, implicit learning based paradigms for enhancing intuitive decision making must be developed. Fourth, the resultant measures, models and learning approach must be implemented into a training technology that demonstrably enhances an individual warfighters' intuitive decision making capabilities.<br />"In hindsight, some of the soldiers acknowledge their "spidey sense" was tingling. It was quiet that day. Possibly too quiet, as the platoon motored through ..." - The Star.com "Story of Company C." September 30, 2006 Mitch Potter, Middle East Bureau. http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/106992<br />"... Thanks to the awareness and quick actions of a 99th Regional Readiness Command (RRC) Soldier, however, no one was seriously injured by the [IED] attack--and he did this all while communicating with his wife on a cell phone..." - Soldier's intuition and situational awareness a lifesaver in Iraq.(UPDATE ON Operation Iraqi Freedom)Publication: Army Reserve Magazine Publication Date: 22-MAR-07Author: Coleman, Chris <br />Today's military missions pose complex time-constrained challenges, such as detecting IED emplacements while in a moving vehicle or detecting anomalous civilian behaviors indicative of impending danger. These challenges are compounded by recent doctrinal requirements that require less-experienced Warfighters to make ever-more complex decisions. Current understanding of decision making, which is based on concepts developed around theories of analytic decision making (Newell and Simon, 1972), cannot effectively address these new challenges since they are based on the notion of enabling experts to apply their expertise to addressing new problems. <br />Yet, there are actually two types of recognized decision making processes, analytical and intuitive which appear to be mediated by different processes or systems (Ross et al, 2004; Evans, 2008; Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009). Analytical decision making is mediated by processes that reflect a sequential, step-by-step, methodical, and time consuming process. In contrast, intuitive decision making relies upon a more holistic approach to processing information. Importantly, intuitive decision making can support analytic decision making processing to continue accounting for prospective outcomes as the external problem space changes (Evans, 2008). Intuition is a rapid, non-conscious, cue to the existence of meaningful information detected through one or more sensory modalities (Luu et al, 2010). Intuition permits information extracted by automatic sensory processes, which operate on the time scale of 100's of milliseconds, to be organized by pre-existing (top-down) knowledge. This unconscious organization of incoming information may elicit a feeling or impression of a solution (Luu et al, 2010), which precedes insight or a sudden awareness of the solution. Recent studies suggest that these systems can also be distinguished on the basis of the neural structures that facilitate their actions (Lieberman, 2000, 2007; Volz, 2008; Luu, 2010). <br />According to Bowers et al. (1990) intuition can guide the judgment process by assisting with the discovery of plausible solutions from which to choose. This characterization of intuition, and many others that follow from it, assumes a high level of familiarity with the information being detected. In fact, until recently, intuitive decision making was assumed to require significant domain expertise (Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009). Yet a growing body of results ranging from the biological (mainly, neural) to the cognitive (Lieberman, 2000; Jung-Beeman et al., 2004; Luu et al 2010) suggests that pre-existing expertise, which requires years of practice to attain (Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus, 1980; Ericsson et al, 1993) may not be a key requirement for intuitive decision making processes. These studies, and others, suggest that intuitive decision making processes share some of the same underlying neural structures and cognitive processes as a type of learning known as implicit learning (Frensch, 2003; Lieberman, 2000, 20007; Kaufman et al, 2010). Consequently, by acquiring domain knowledge through implicit learning, one may be able to automatically strengthen, at the neural, cognitive and behavioral levels, the same capabilities that are needed for effective intuitive decision making.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives: <br /></span>The objective of this proposed topic is to build a deeper understanding of the neural, cognitive and behavioral processes underlying intuitive decision making, in order to train non-experts to be more effective decision makers. The expected outcomes of this project will include a characterization of how intuition works; a computational model representing these findings; and, training techniques &amp; technologies that enhance intuitive decision making performance. It is expected that these results will lay a scientific foundation for understanding intuitive decision making that will support Cyberwarfare, Unmanned System Operators, Information Analysts, Small Unit Leaders and other domains that require individuals to process and make sense of large volumes of information in time constrained or information-degraded conditions. As well, this effort will establish a technical basis from which to develop new classes of applications that support selection, training, decision aiding and interface design. The Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning Basic Research Challenge will provide the right blend of incentive, risk and benefit to revolutionize the state of the art in improving decision making. Successful proposals will focus on developing innovative, scalable, and affordable technologies that blend the best measurement technologies and modeling approaches with scenario/simulation based training solutions to enable cost effective dissemination of these technologies to a wide range of users.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Areas: <br /></span>The primary hypothesis underlying this topic is that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making. Testing this hypothesis requires advances in specific research areas that include: <br />1) Characterizing intuitive decision making and implicit learning across neural, cognitive and behavioral levels of representation. There is a range of measurement techniques available to do this. It is expected that proposers to this effort will leverage and extend these wherever possible, to ensure that the resultant data are of sufficient quality to develop effective models; <br />2) Representing intuitive decision making through cognitive models in order to guide implicit learning techniques. Based in large part on advances in understanding of the human brain AND advances in machine learning techniques, it is possible to develop representations of cognition that can represent individual differences, adapt to new contexts and information and that can be modified based on other physiological features like stress and fatigue (Mitchell et al 2004; Shinkareva et al 2008). These new techniques enable a greater ability to represent an individual's current &lsquo;state' and forecast future &lsquo;states' in order to anticipate and tailor to the individual's specific needs; <br />3) Applying simulation / scenario based techniques to develop implicit learning approaches that enhance intuitive decision making. Simulation based training provides a flexible environment for both delivering training and for collecting a range of performance measures (OSer et al, 1999). The scenario based training approach provides a validated process for identifying training requirements, developing the scenario(s) to support these requirements and establishing metrics and techniques for analyzing and assessing trainee performance. There are numerous training simulations available that represent domains in which effective intuitive decision making is critical (e.g. IED detection; Social interaction training; Intelligence analysis; etc) and it is expected that existing systems will be leveraged and extended rather than new ones being developed for this effort;<br />4) Testing and validating the hypothesis that implicit learning facilitates intuitive decision making. This includes comparing neural, cognitive and behavioral performance measures across different conditions. Successful validation plans will include approaches capable of demonstrating that: the neural structures that are active during implicit learning are also active during intuition; that in the absence of implicit learning there are different / distinct patterns of neural activity during an intuitive decision making task; that in control tasks in which neither implicit learning was provided or intuitive decision making required, these structures are minimally active; and, that under those conditions in which implicit learning was provided and intuitive decision making was present, there is a significant improvement in decision making compared to other conditions - for example, as represented by a receiver operator characteristic curve. Specific measures and assessment approaches are left to the proposer but must include approaches that will cut across multiple representation levels and provide a means for distinguishing the effects of implicit learning on intuitive making, if such are present, from other conditions. <br />The Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning Basic Research Challenge will proceed as a four year effort encompassing the above research areas. It is anticipated that addressing each of these research areas will require a multi-year effort to complete and that performance on each research area may overlap in time. Teaming is encouraged within and across research areas. Decomposing each research area into subareas (e.g, breaking up research area 1 into a neural, a cognitive and a behavioral task), each of which is covered by different team members is acceptable if reasonably justified and supported by a clear management / team coordination plan.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />III. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION <br /></span></strong>White papers should not exceed 6 single-sided pages, exclusive of cover page and resume of principal investigator, and should be in 12-point Times New Roman font with margins not less than one inch. The cover page should be labeled "White Paper for BASIC RESEARCH CHALLENGE - ENHANCING INTUITIVE DECISION MAKING THROUGH IMPLICIT LEARNING" and include the following information: title of the proposed effort, technical point of contact, telephone number, fax numbers, and e-mail address. The 6-page body of the white paper should include the following information: (1) Principal Investigator; (2) Relevance of the proposed effort to the research areas described in Section II; (3) Technical objective of the proposed effort; (4) Technical approach that will be pursued to meet the objective; (5) A summary of recent relevant technical breakthroughs; and (6) A program management plan that includes a high level timeline for proposed tasks, indicates proposed team members who will be accomplishing those tasks and a funding plan showing requested funding per fiscal year. A resume of the principal investigator, not to exceed 1 page, should also be included after the 6-page body of the white paper. <br />White papers are required for all offerors seeking funding. Each white paper will be evaluated by the Government to determine whether the technology advancement proposed appears to be of particular value to the Department of the Navy. Only the authors of white papers that appear to be of particular value to the Department of the Navy will be invited to submit full proposals. Initial Government evaluations and feedback will be issued via e-mail notification from the Technical Points of Contact. <br />Detailed Full Proposal (Technical and Cost volumes) will be subsequently encouraged from those offerors whose proposed technologies have been identified through the above referenced e-mail as being of "particular value" to the Government. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. <br />For white papers that propose efforts that are considered of particular value to the Navy but either exceed available budgets or contain certain tasks or applications that are not desired by the Navy, ONR may suggest a full proposal with reduced effort to fit within expected available budgets or an effort that refocuses the tasks or application of the technology to maximize the benefit to the Navy. <br />White papers should be submitted electronically to the business point of contact whose e-mail address appears at the end of this Special Notice. These white papers shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format. <br />To ensure full, timely consideration for funding, <strong>white papers should be submitted no later than</strong> <strong>16 April 2012</strong>. White Papers received after that date will be considered as time and availability of funding permit.<br />The planned date for completing the review of white papers is on or about&nbsp;01 June 2012. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IV. FULL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND AWARD INFORMATION <br /></span></strong>Full proposals (including one technical volume and one cost volume) should be submitted under ONR BAA 12-001 by <strong>16 July 2012</strong>. Full Proposals received after that date will be considered as time and availability of funding permit.<br />ONR anticipates that both grants and contracts will be issued for this effort. Proposals for contracts should be submitted in accordance with the instructions at Section IV, Application and Submission Information, item 2.b., Full Proposals. Full proposals for grants should be submitted in accordance with the instructions at Section IV., Application and Submission Information, item 5., Submission of Grant Proposals thorough Grants.gov.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>
