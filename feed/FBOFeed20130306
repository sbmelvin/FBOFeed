The requisite service support entails the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Proper installation of equipment<br />&bull; Preventative maintenance and inspection of equipment<br />&bull; Non-scheduled / repair maintenance of new and current equipment<br />&bull; Part support involving availability, replacement, repairing and returning of unique tool and tool kits, individual parts, repair parts and consumable supplies<br />&bull; Training of government technicians for the capability to perform required maintenance and repairs to equipment<br />&bull; 24 hours toll free telephone support<br />&bull; Ship Rider support services<br />&bull; Warranty support and maintenance agreements<br />&bull; Device removal at the end of the their life cycle</p>

<DESC><p>The Forest Service contemplates releasing solicitation no. AG-0116-S-13-0022 for the Calamity Carroll Road Stabilization project on or after March 25, 2013, on this FedBizOpps site. All interested parties should visit this site from time to time to obtain the solicitation when it is released, and any amendments that may be released afterwards. Proposals will be due on or after April 29, 2013.</p>
<p>The period of performance will start with issuance of the Notice to Proceed in the spring or summer of 2013 with actual on-site work occurring between June 1, 2013, and October 31, 2013. The estimated magnitude of the project is between $250,000 and $500,000. The contract will be for culvert removal, cleaning, and replacement; landside removal; bridge salvage; rock borrow production, haul, and placing; end haul of slide material, waterbar construction, and general road repair.</p>
<p>The project is on Revillagigedo Island in two separate locations, Upper Carroll Inlet and Shoal Cove. The Forest Service has a single lane road system at each location; however, there are no commercial services available at either site. Access to these locations is by boat or floatplane. The nearest community is Ketchikan, Alaska.</p>
<p>A total small business set-aside is contemplated. All interested prospective offerors are invited to identify themselves to the contracting officer by fax'ing a one-page note to 907.228.6254 with (a) the project identifier solicitation number AG-0116-S-13-0022 and name Calamity Carroll Road Stabilization project; (b) the firm's name, phone, address, point of contact and so forth; (c) the firm's DUNS number; (d) the firm's eligibility as a small, HUBZone, SDVOSB, or other eligibility under NAICS 237990; and (e) a brief past performance summary. Please, only a one-page fax. <br /><br />The intent of the contract will be the complete construction of the project as will be indicated in the contract, drawings, and specifications when they are released.</p>
<p>The particulars of the project may change between the date of this posting and the solicitation release date.</p>
<p>A hosted site visit is not contemplated. However, prospective offerors should and are expected to visit the work site at their convenience. The contract clause at FAR 52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work, will be included in the solicitation and resulting contract. The work site is public land and offerors are free to visit; a courtesy notice of the visit may be sent to the Ketchikan Ranger District at FAX 907.225.8738. Visitors should take care not to interfere with any operations that may be ongoing at the work locations.</p>
<p>This acquisition is very similar to the Calamity Carroll Road Stabilization project that was advertised in FedBizOpps on June 20, 2012, under solicitation number AG-0116-S-12-0120. That solicitation did not proceed to award because the Forest Service lost its funding for fire purposes. In this new acquisition, the bridge to be salvaged will be salvaged and stored on site rather than get moved to Thorne Bay for storage.</p>
<p>All inquiries regarding this acquisition should be directed to the contracting officer. The preferred method is by fax 907.228.6254.</p>

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for two (2) research grade engineering test unit Mass Spectrometers. Each unit consists of a miniaturized mass spectrometer, electron ionization source, modified IonCam Studio graphical user interface and Analyzer data analysis software, embedded PC, external power supply, and a protective travel case. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from OI Analytical. OI Analytical designs, manufactures, markets, and supports analytical instruments used for sample preparation, detection, and measurement of chemical compounds. Market research and RFI responses were used to determine the available volatile detection instruments and based on the requirements there was only one manufacturer of a MS currently available that can demonstrate the detection of low mass species with the required data acquisition rate required by NASA.  An O I Analytical MS test unit was purchased and integrated into the RESOLVE system for the Field Demonstration Unit.  The next version of the RESOLVE (Vacuum Development Unit) will build based on the Field Demonstration Unit technology and utilize the same GC-MS analytical instrumentation.  There is a requirement for commonality as we move forward in our design and technology maturity. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 20, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<CONTACT>Dorothy Maxwell, Phone 301-435-0352, Fax 301-480-3345, Email maxwelld@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to GE Healthcare, 800 Centennial Avenue, P.O. Box 1327, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855 to provide a service contract renewal for the Personal Delta Vision System.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The following system for this service contract renewal:</strong></span></p>
<p>1.	Personal Delta Vision, Model Number: 29039895, Serial Number: PD11439, Agreement Type: Full Care.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Cytogenetics and Microscopy Core provide NHGRI investigators with imaging services, access and assistant with fluorescence live cell microscopy. To continue to perform these studies, NHGRI requires a state-of-the-art auto focus hardware to add more precise and reliable feature for the Delta Vision Personal system that is being used for live cell experiments.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</strong></p>
<p><br />This Purchase Order will have a base and four (4) Option year periods for 12-Months each.<br />Monthly Service Contract (March 2013 through March 2018)<br />Base period: March 2013 - March 2014<br />Plus Four (4) option years:<br />Option year 1: March 2014 - March 2015<br />Option year 2: March 2015 - March 2016<br />Option year 3: March 2016 - March 2017<br />Option year 4: March 2017 - March 2018</p>
<p><br /><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>NHGRI is requesting to procure a Service Contract Renewal for the Delta Vision Personal system, now that the warranty has expired.  Without a service contract in place, it would cost a significant amount to have repairs made, thus potential disruption on the research studies in many of the NHGRI laboratories.  Therefore, a request for a 12-Month Service Contract with General Electric Healthcare (GE) formally provided by Applied Precision Inc., which is the sole manufacturer of the Delta Vision Personal systemt is essential. <br />The DeltaVision Personal microscope system is a very sophisticated piece of equipment that enables investigators to make observations that cannot be made by conventional fluorescence microscopy. It is very important to maximize the use of this expensive piece of equipment as the number of investigators who use it has increased steadily. In addition to the increase in users, the microscope is being used for more sophisticated types of experiments. A service contract is required to reduce downtime and allow users access to new software upgrades. No other company can provide GE certified service and parts. GE Healthcare Field Service Engineers receive extensive training on the equipment and have a high level of technical expertise.  All manufacturer training is provided for GE Engineers only and no third parties are allowed.</p>
<p><br /><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:</strong></p>
<p><br />&bull;	The Government will accept the job performed by the Contractor. If it is a repair, equipment needs to demonstrate continuous performance.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance and the Small Business Size Standard is $19.0M.  The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-66 (February 28, 2013).</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a sole source on competitive basis for Service Contract Renewal to GE Healthcare is based upon a previous purchase order issued under HHSN268201200088P, March 26, 2012 for this requirement. Any information received as a result of this pre-solicitation / notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurements.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  If you have any questions, please submit to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.</p>

<SUBJECT>Intent to Sole Source to LipoScience, Inc. For the Purchase of the Vantera Clinical Analyzer, with Nuclear Magnetic Residence (NMR) Technology 
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-CSB-HL-2013-100-RRJ

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent Synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive award to LipoScience, Inc., Raleigh, NC for the Vantera Clinical Analyzer, with NMR Technology. <br /><br />
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf Lipoprotein Metabolism and the Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Disease sections of the Cardiovascular Pulmonary Branch (CPB) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the LipoScience, Inc.'s Vantera Clinical Analyzer, with NMR Technology to LipoScience, Inc. for the measurement of lipoprotein particle numbers and lipoprotein subfractions by Nuclear Magnetic Residence (NMR). The NMR analyzer will be used for two main applications. The first application will be the measurement of lipoprotein particle numbers and subfractions on human and mouse serum samples. It is anticipated that it will be used for the measurement of over 10,000 samples a year and therefore will have to be fully automated and high-throughput. It should have both the hardware, such as an automated sample rack delivery system and the software for the fully automated reporting of results. The second application will be the measurement of lipoprotein particle number and lipoprotein subfractions after the in vitro modification of samples, such as treatment to deplete or enrich for the various components of lipoproteins. This will involve the analysis of the NMR spectra at different at different chemical shifts that what may be used for lipoprotein analysis, therefore, the NMR spectra should contain software for the flexible development of user defined parameters for NMR analysis. The equipment will provide the necessary data on the interaction of lipoprotein particle number and subfractions to help design better diagnostic tests and to investigate new lipid modifying therapies, which is a major objective of the Cardiovascular Pulmonary Branch.</p>
<p>The following general specifications are required for the clinical diagnostic NMR analyzer:</p>
<p>&bull; 200 sample tube capacity for front end sample rack system<br />&bull; 150ul sample size limit<br />&bull; sample throughput of at least 35 samples/hr<br />&bull; Sample diluted online with 150ul of diluent and internal standard<br />&bull; Positive sample ID through use of barcodes<br />&bull; Automated cleaning of system between samples and during daily maintenance<br />&bull; Automated magnetic field alignment and verification<br />&bull; 400Mhz magnet<br />&bull; Automated spectra analysis, result calculation, pre and post analytical QC to verify system function and sample integrity<br />&bull; Training</p>
<p>The basis for the sole source determination is based upon the fact that: LipoScience, Inc. is the sole provider of the Vantera Clinical Analyzer, with NMR Technology. The LipoScience's Vantera Clinical Analyzer is a unique NMR diagnostic device that is currently the only commercially available NMR system that automates the processing and analysis of plasma and serum based samples. The Vantera Clinical Analyzer combines nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic detection and proprietary signal processing algorithms to identify and quantify concentrations of lipoproteins and, potentially, small molecule metabolites. Other NMR systems that are currently available for research purposes do not include the automated features and hardware (sample rack) of the Vantera for the high throughput processing of clinical samples. The algorithm on the Vantera analyzer for converting the NMR spectra into lipoprotein particle numbers and subfractions is also unique and are not currently commercially developed would likely take several years to develop and validate on a research grade NMR analyzer. Additionally there is unique/proprietary tool kits/software available on the Vantera to further interrogate the digitized NMR sample spectrum for quantification of unknown metabolites and their disease correlation.</p>
<p>The LipoScience Vantera Clinical Analyzer, with NMR Technology, received FDA clearance and will be placed with national and regional clinical laboratories. The Vantera Clinical Analyzer combines nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic detection and proprietary signal processing algorithms to identify and quantify concentrations of lipoproteins and, potentially, small molecule metabolites. LipoProfile test is LipoScience's proprietary diagnostic test that measures the number of low density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P) in a blood sample and provides physicians and their patients with actionable information to personalize management of risk for heart disease.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 423450 - Medical, Dental, and Hospital Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers with a size standard of 100 employees.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being request and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the preventative maintenance services for the BD Biosciences Flow Cytometer Analyzer to BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any information received as a result of this Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability for any future competitive procurement by responding to this notice in writing, no later than March 20, 2013 at 11:59 p.m. EST. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement.

FAI is responsible for delivering and promoting the delivery by other CFO Act and SAC agencies with world-class, innovative, and results-oriented training programs, professional development opportunities, job performance aids, continuous learning courses, and other activities designed to help civilian acquisition personnel effectively accomplish their assigned job duties and critical missions.  FAI sponsors courses leading to professional certification in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Certification - Contracting (FAC-C), the Federal Acquisition Certification - Contracting Officer's Representative (FAC-COR), and the Federal Acquisition Certification - Program/Project Management (FAC-P/PM) policies.  While FAI sponsors certification training courses, it cannot provide all of the required training for the CFO Act and SAC agencies' acquisition workforce.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Section 565(b)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) establishes the statutory authority for the provision of technical assistance for grants authorized under Section 561(a) of the PHS Act. Section 565(b) provides that the Secretary, DHHS, may provide technical assistance directly or through grants to, or contracts with, public and non-profit private entities.

An important component will be to disseminate to the Branch and to grantees that are part of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program (Children's Mental Health Initiative). This support is intended to create a more successful program and strengthen the foundation for service expansion. <br />Part II of this task order is to provide direct training and technical assistance (TA) to states, tribes, territories and communities with cooperative agreements awarded through the Children's Mental Health Initiative. Technical assistance will include initial and ongoing assessment and delivery of TA needs through a strategic planning process, consultation, training, meeting development and support and coordination with other child-serving agencies as specified in the Statement of Work.</p>

Government furnished property in the form of lids, hardware and gaskets for the containers will be provided.   <br>  <br> Planned Acquisition: The solicitation announcement and release will include all pertinent information for interested sources to submit their best offers.   <br>  <br> Submission Information: All interested sources should submit their responses to Mr. Gene Spillane at ACC-NJ via Eugene.G.Spillane.civ@mail.mil.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS

Subject:  Execution and implementation of a standardized Tele-Rehabilitation and In-Person home visit research protocol for transfer and mobility impaired older adults and their informal caregivers. 
The Atlanta VAMC Caregiver Support Studies Lab is seeking Contractors to implement an intervention for one of our newly funded research studies that will target older adult Veterans (ages 60 and older) and their informal caregivers.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for the execution and implementation of a funded research protocol with two arms: (1) traditional in-person evaluation and training visit series; (2) Tele-rehabilitation (TR) evaluation and training visit series.  The Contractor must be able to meet the detailed requirements for both the in-person and Tele-rehabilitation arms.  Contractor must supply the Tele-health communication devices equipped with a dynamic content management system. 
For the duration of this three year study, the Contractor must dedicate two to three part-time OTs on a PRN basis for randomly assigned Tele-Rehabilitation and In-Person Home Visits for the purposes of evaluation and training on assistive technology (AT) devices per scripted, standardized research protocols. Assistive technology (AT) in this study refers to but is not limited to: grab bars, Super-Poles, raised toilet seats, bed rails, and other in-home devices to assist with activities of daily living such as bathing, toileting, getting dressed, and getting in and out of bed. Contractor is required to procure assistive technology (AT) devices that have been approved by the PI and/or designee.  
The Contractor must provide a licensed, bonded, and insured contractor/builder who is a Certified Aging in Place Specialist (CAPS) and who has documented experience in the assessment and installation of Assistive Technology/Durable Medical Equipment including but not limited to grab bars, Super-Poles, and bath rails within Veterans' homes.
For the Tele-rehabilitation arm of this study, these OTs will perform assessments and training with the Veteran/caregiver dyads remotely from our offices via Tele-video conferencing. VA staff will be in the dyads' home operating the Tele-rehab equipment.  The Contractor must provide the following services for executing and implementing the Tele-rehabilitation arm of this study, to include the development of a customized dynamic content management system (within 30 days of acquiring the contract and beta testing to be completed within 45 days of acquiring the contract).  The specific components include: (1) 150-200 electronic surveys and questionnaires (approximately 8,000 specific research questions to collect participant data) with CRM (customer relationship management) capabilities that will set reminders to take surveys; (2) four versions of an interactive daily activity journal with 300-350 specific questions for data collection and questions to generate automated alerts to research team; (3) excel interactive data dictionary to accompany the journals;  (4) incorporation of data algorithms into individualized adaptive prescriptions (interventions and resources); (5) video conferencing for Tele-rehabilitation between older adult Veterans/caregivers and OTs, (6) organization and exportation of data as a CSV file directly to a VA server for research team to examine for data analysis. 
All employees provided by the Contractor for this project must commit to travel throughout a 75 mile radius of the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Decatur, GA (from the hours of Monday-Friday; 7:30am-7pm).

<DESC>The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) requests industry input on the Agency's need for access through a web-service interface to a contractor's system that provides real-time data whereby the contractor would provide financial viability information on companies petitioning to employ alien beneficiaries, and companies registering in the E-Verify program, used for verifying the employment eligibility of newly hired employees. This acquisition requires real-time data being provided referred to as information provisioning and an Application Programming Interface (API) utilized via the web to transmit data and queries.
<p>USCIS would like to verify and validate the existence, location, financial viability, and current level of business operations of a company through a contract vehicle with an Independent Information Provider (IIP) to support the Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) initiative and the E-Verify program. It is anticipated that the forthcoming acquisition would require the service of a contractor in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be able to be interfaced with existing USCIS systems<br /><br />&bull; Algorithm refinement that will be used to reduce copious information into a simplified report for Immigration Service Officers to determine the financial viability of petitioning companies<br /><br />&bull; Integration Support for the initial connection and integration of the contractor's web-service to the USCIS Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), whereby USCIS can automatically transmit queries<br /><br />&bull; Access through a web-service interface, to the IIP's system, whereby USCIS can automatically transmit queries <br /><br />&bull; Training to USCIS on the content of the information being provided by the IIP<br /><br />&bull; The IIP shall provide an unlimited amount of monthly inquiries to access company records via on-demand live data using the web-service. <br /><br />&bull; Research Services to provide research support to gather information on a company if the IIP does not have information on a company, does not have sufficient information on a company, or the information provided conflicts with information provided by the company. This includes (1) Data investigation support for instances where no data resides in the database; (2) Data accuracy support for instances of insufficient data in the database; and (3) Data analysis<br /><br />&bull; Provide a solution that injects valuable real-time business information directly into USCIS' Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Platform to enhance the E-Verify program<br /><br />&bull; Subscription to an IIP website on a 24/7 basis for pre-formatted reports on companies<br /><br />&bull; Provide project management support for planning and completion of all IIP activities</p>
<p>During prior market research it was determined that licensing terms may restrict customers from retaining information in any media once the contract has expired, and from providing information to third parties, such as other Federal Government agencies, without prior written consent of the contractor. The Government requires licensing terms that allow the information provided to be retained in adjudicator files in perpetuity. Further, this information may be viewed and used by other Government agencies for legal proceedings, such as court hearings or similar administrative hearing activities related to granting or denying immigration benefits. It has also been determined through market research that industry does not provide warranty terms regarding the accuracy of information provided. The Government may potentially use the information in a court of law, as such, it must be supportable.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should address the following:</p>
<p>1) Ability and willingness to develop warranty terms. If already available, describe the warranties you provide. If warranties are somehow implicit, what level of accuracy is considered typical or acceptable?</p>
<p>2) Ability and willingness to provide exceptions to standard licensing terms and conditions relating specifically to how the data provided can be used, stored, and maintained during and after the end of the contract.</p>
<p>3) What would be the price impact of modifying standard licensing and warranty terms? Please describe the impact by showing it in relation to the pricing of standard licensing terms.</p>
<p>4) Describe if your system has the capability to be accessed through a Web-Service. If yes, can you please provide the Web-Service Definition Language (WSDL) or link to the WSDL through which you provide an interface?</p>
<p>5) How does your organization structure pricing if this information is accessed through a web-service?</p>
<p>6) Describe your ability regarding data investigation support.</p>
<p>7) Describe your ability to train users in the proper interpretation of the information provided.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received. This RFI in no way obligates the Government to place an order.</p>
<p>The data received in response to this RFI is for informational purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements. It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark all proprietary information. No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.

<DESC><strong>This is a Sources Sought <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY</span> for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANY</span> Small Business!</strong>
<p>Please respond via email to the Points of Contact stated for this request, with your corporate capabilities and any other relevant information as they pertain to being able to support the stated requirement and would allow USDA to determine your ability to perform the following type of requirement.</p>
<p><br /><strong>1:0 BACKGROUND <br /><br /></strong>The mission of the USDA Satellite Imagery Archive (SIA) is to make satellite imagery available to USDA subscriber agencies in a timely and economical fashion during the US crop growing season. Key performance indicators are measured by timely distribution and receipt of requested satellite imagery during the 2013 crop season, and providing bulk satellite imagery during the 2013 crop season at a measurable economic benefit to the USDA subscribing agencies from April 1, 2013 through September 31, 2013.<br /><br />The USDA's Remote Sensing Coordinating Committee (RSCC) recommended the formation of the SIA, which evolved from annual imagery purchased by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) from approximately 1985-2000. The SIA was officially established in March, 2000 by a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Foreign Agricultural Service, Farm Service Agency, Forest Service (FS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The National Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), the Risk Management Agency (RMA) and the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) later became SIA subscribers. The members of the RSCC include the above USDA subscribing agencies and the RSCC meets quarterly to review SIA activities, as well as exchange satellite imagery information between the USDA subscribing members.<br /><br />The SIA facility is managed and operated by the SIA Manager, with the assistance of one contractor (the Archive Assistant). The SIA Manager reports quarterly to the USDA's RSCC pertaining to imagery request fulfillments and he/she is responsible for the purchase, receipt, inventory, storage, and dissemination of satellite imagery to USDA agency subscribers, as well as the physical management of the SIA facility and the online Archive Explorer (AE) system at http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/archive_explorer/default.cfm. The SIA facility and AE system is located in the USDA South Building in Washington DC and it is managed by the International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), Office of Global Analysis (OGA).<br /><br />All satellite imagery for the current SOW will be delivered by the satellite vendor to the USDA's SIA, and the imagery later distributed to subscribing USDA agency members through the AE (Archive Explorer) system.<br /><br /><strong>2:0 OBJECTIVE<br /><br /></strong>The objective is to acquire moderate resolution satellite imagery to monitor the United States upcoming 2013 crop season from April 1, 2013 through September 31, 2013. The base coverage Area of Interest (AOI) is the lower 48 states of the United States<br /><br /><strong>3:0 SCOPE OF WORK<br /><br /></strong>The Scope of Work is to deliver moderate satellite imagery within the lower 48 states of the United States to USDA's SIA and according to the requirements specified below.</p>
<p><strong>a. Pixel Resolution:</strong> The horizontal ground resolution or ground sample distance (the area of the ground represented in each pixel in x and y components) of the multispectral imagery shall be no less than 20 meters and no greater than 29-meters and no imagery should be resampled to meet this resolution requirements. Proposals with multispectral ground sample distance outside the specified range will be considered.<br /><br /><strong>b. Geo-referencing:</strong> Orthorectification within 72 hours of image acquisition to a CE90 (Circular Error of 90%) or within one pixel of image ground sample distance is desired.<br /><br /><strong>c. Band Combination:</strong> Four (4) bands of multispectral imagery are required, consisting of two visible bands, one near infrared (NIR) band and one short-wave infrared band (SWIR) is preferred. A minimum of three (3) bands (2 visible plus 1 NIR) is required.<br /><br /><strong>d. Resampling method:</strong> Cubic Convolution<br /><br /><strong>e. Cloud Cover:</strong> Imagery with 30% or less cloud cover is required.<br /><br /><strong>f. Swath Width:</strong> Satellite imagery with swath width equal to or greater than 185-kilometers is required. Satellite imagery with swath widths less than 185-kilometers will not be considered. Larger swath width greater than 185-km is preferred.<br /><br /><strong>g. Temporal Resolution or Overpass Frequency:</strong> Orthorectified satellite imagery to be delivered daily to USDA SIA within 72 hours of acquisition, with overpass frequency of minimum of two (2) times (3 preferred) per month. That is, the frequency of satellite-image collection should result in at least two scenes per month of 30% or less cloud-free imagery over the cropland pixels. <br /><br /><strong>h. Cloud Coverage over Cropland Pixels:</strong> Due to constraints caused by clouds that can appear in any portion of the scene when a satellite is overhead, FAS/IPAD will accept all satellite images that are more than 30% cloud cover for the entire image but cloud cover is less than 30% over the cropland pixels within the image. A predefined crop mask that is accepted by FAS/IPAD can be used by the vendor to define "cropland pixels" and for determining if less than 30% of the cropland pixels are covered by clouds.</p>

<p>Please respond via email to the Points of Contact stated for this request, with your corporate capabilities and any other relevant information as they pertain to being able to support the stated requirement and would allow USDA to determine your ability to perform the following type of requirement.</p>
<p><strong>1:0 BACKGROUND <br /></strong>Satellite imagery transformation products are essential sources of data and information to the primary mission of FAS-OGA-IPAD of Global Crop Production Intelligence System (GCPIS). USDA FAS OGA is seeking the acquisition of Global Satellite-Based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Composites for Monitoring Global Vegetation Conditions for a period of performance of twelve (12) months from April 1, 2013 - March 31, 2014. <br /><br />Key performance indicators are measured by timely distribution and receipt of requested satellite imagery-based NDVI. The FAS/IPAD requests a delivery schedule that ensures the NDVI composites imagery shall be delivered within 72-hours of successful collection from the satellite. A delivery schedule based on business days is not preferred, as NDVI imagery delivery should not be delayed later than 72-hours after collection, regardless if the delivery date falls on a weekend and/or holiday. All the global10-day NDVI maximum value composites and the 10-year NDVI historical archive with average NDVI composite values for 36 dekads will be delivered by the vendor to the USDA's Crop Explorer and other Decision Support Systems as needed.<br /><br /><strong>2:0 OBJECTIVE<br /></strong>The objective of the Contract is to acquire and process global 10-day NDVI composites with at least 1-kilometer spatial resolution, as well as provide a 10-year average NDVI archive (2001-2010) that can be used by the FAS/IPAD for global vegetation and crop condition monitoring and according to the FAS requirements listed in the Performance of Work Statement for a period of performance of twelve (12) months from April 1, 2013 - March 31, 2014. The base coverage Area of Interest (AOI) is the entire globe (earth land surface).<br /><br /><strong>3:0 SCOPE OF WORK<br /></strong>The Scope of Work is to acquire, process and deliver global 10-day NDVI composites, as well as provide a 10-year average NDVI archive (2001-2010) that can be used by the FAS/IPAD for global vegetation and crop condition monitoring and according to the requirements specified below.<br /><br /><strong>a. Product Type: <br /><br /></strong>1. 10-day NDVI maximum value composites with global coverage and having at least 1-kilometer spatial resolution. That is a total of 36-dekads of 10-day NDVI composites provided within 72-hours after imagery is acquired from the satellite<br /><br />2. 10-year NDVI historical archive with average NDVI composite values for 36 dekads (or 36*10-day periods=365-366 days/year) to be provided at the start date of the subscription contract<br /><br /><strong>b. Coverage:</strong> The NDVI composites should be global, covering the eastern and western hemispheres, and extending to 65-degree north latitude and 65-degree south latitude. <br /><br /><strong>c. Pixel Resolution:</strong> The horizontal ground resolution or ground sample distance (the area of the ground represented in each pixel in x and y components) of the NDVI composite pixels should not be greater than 1.1-kilometer. In addition, the pixels should not be resampled to meet these resolution requirements. <br /><br /><strong>d. Time period for NDVI composites:</strong> The NDVI composite time period should be 10-days (or dekad), with the third dekad of the month comprising of 8-, 9-, 10- or 11-days, for a total of 36 dekads per year.<br /><br /><strong>e. NDVI Calculations:</strong> Daily raw digital imagery from the red and near-infrared (NIR) channels should be collected, calibrated over time for radiometric sensor decay, and clouds and shadows removed from the daily red and NIR bands. <br /><br /><strong>f. Maximum Value NDVI Composites:</strong> As a method of cloud and haze screening, 10-day Maximum Value NDVI Composites should be produced where the highest NDVI pixel value within the 10-day time period (i.e., dekad) is retained under the assumption it represents the maximum vegetation "greenness" during the 10-day time period.<br /><br /><strong>g. Geo-referencing:</strong> Orthorectification to a CE90 (Circular Error of 90%) or within one pixel of image ground sample distance is desired.<br /><br /><strong>h. Product Accuracy and other Characteristics: </strong>NDVI imagery vendors should provide two quotes that clearly states license descriptions for: (1) Minimum USDA-wide license use only, and ((2) US Federal/Civil-wide license use. The FAS/IPAD at minimum requires USDA-wide agency use, but another price quote for US Federal/Civil use should be included.<br /><br /><strong>i. Delivery Schedule:</strong> The FAS/IPAD requests a delivery schedule that ensures the NDVI composites imagery shall be delivered within 72-hours of successful collection from the satellite. A delivery schedule based on business days is not preferred, as NDVI imagery delivery should not be delayed later than 72-hours after collection, regardless if the delivery date falls on a weekend and/or holiday.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND<br />FOH provides Occupational Health (OH) consultation, and stimulates the Development of improved OH and safety programs throughout the Federal Government.

<p>Among its many functions, FOH assists Federal managers in establishing OH services for Federal employees; assessing, and monitoring environmental hazards for special classes of employees, complying with mandated and voluntary OH standards, counseling employees at physical or emotional risk from alcoholism, drug abuse, stress, or other job-related factors, maintaining a drug-free workplace, and promoting optimal employee wellness and physical fitness. FOH also performs work for Federal agencies, under 100 percent reimbursable Economy Act interagency agreements. In 2011, FOH had over 1000 agreements with 160 Federal departments and agencies. Agreements are negotiated with Federal Departments&lsquo; and Federal Agencies&lsquo; National headquarters, and/or with their regional/local components. Some of these agreements are for a standard package of OH program components; others are for an array of services and consultations tailored to particular OH or environmental needs.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 311119 Other animal Food Manufacturing for an upcoming requirement for the National Wildlife Health Center, in Madison, WI to provide palatable, biodegradable bait powder for delivery of oral sylvatic plague vaccine to prairie dogs.
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 
This requirement is for prairie dog bait that can hold an oral vaccine against sylvatic plague (SPV) that has been developed for prairie dogs and other wild rodents.  In order to deliver the vaccine under field conditions, a palatable, biodegradable, and environmentally safe bait is needed that provides a stable delivery mechanism for the vaccine.  The vaccine will be incorporated into the bait medium and dropped via plane or vehicle in targeted areas where prevention of plague outbreaks in wild rodents is desired. Technical Requirements for Prairie Dog Bait for the USGS are to include but not limited to the following: A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.
Responses to this announcement are requested from businesses that can provide the requested product(s) or service(s). This information will assist the Government in planning and acquisition strategy.
Interested businesses who feel that they can provide the bait mixture (based upon the criteria specified herein), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  The prairie dog bait formula must have the ability to encapsulate virtually any material and because the bait must be made at relatively low temperatures compared to all other polymers, active ingredients can be added without inactivating or reducing their potency.  Also the property of the material must allow for the active ingredients to be added thoroughly throughout the bait allowing for an even distribution. The material must also act as a stabilizer for "active" or "live" components, such as live virus vaccines.  The bait must have a long shelf-life and in its most processed form the titer of the active ingredients and remain at satisfactory levels. The bait matrix shall be 100% environmentally friendly and completely biodegradable. Research must demonstrate a highly stable medium for similar live viral vaccines. References with contact names and phone numbers must also be listed. These references are to be for contracts similar in scope and with the same technical requirements as the contract under consideration. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Business firms who feel they can provide the analysis shall also submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER (including DUNS NUMBER); and (2) their SIZE STATUS.   Your company must have be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM) at SAM.gov. Your on-line SAM registration will cover any/all of your offers to the Federal Government, and only needs to be updated annually.
All responses must be submitted NLT March 19, 2013 at 3:00pm MST via e-mail to: tbeals@usgs.gov.
This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website and no paper copies will be provided.

<a href="mailto:bjorn.t.hale@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> Project is for the removal of existing coal fired boilers and replacement with NOx gas fired boilers and all associated infrastructure and necessary appurtenances. Install forced draft fans with variable frequency drives and configured for flue gas recirculation system. Installation and testing will commence during normal boiler operation timeframe. Project will remove all coal and ash handling equipment and will install maximum achievable control technology.  <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to bjorn.t.hale@usace.army.mil no later than by 1000 hrs EST on 15 March 2013.  <br>

DRAFT PWS
Under ACA, VA health care is deemed to qualify as minimum essential coverage. The VA's medical benefit package is robust and provides for a comprehensive range of services typical of most insurance plans and also provides for additional benefits beyond most insurance products. The VA is a recognized leader in many specialty care services such as mental health and prosthetics. The VA health care charges no enrollment premium and the cost-sharing provisions are very favorable to the Veteran.  As such, the VA understands its Veteran population and the option that VA health care presents to eligible Veterans.  Not all eligible Veterans decide to enroll with VA health care for myriad reasons; many enrolled Veterans also have some other public or private health insurance including Medicaid, Medicare, or employer sponsored insurance. Under ACA, some Veterans will have new options for health care, primarily through states that expand Medicaid eligibility, the health insurance marketplace and, if otherwise eligible, the premium tax credit either for themselves and/or their family members. 
The VA is seeking to identify organizations to assist VA as it implements the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Specifically sought are organizations with a comprehensive understanding of States positions regarding expansion of Medicaid eligibility under ACA and states' approach to establishing a health insurance marketplace (formerly health insurance exchange). 
As VA implements ACA in 2013, it recognizes that the VA must better understand the larger health care environment at both the national and state level.  At the national level, VA has engaged with HHS and other federal agencies to ensure that the VA complies with the law. Since several key decisions regarding the implementation of ACA are left to the states, VA may seek assistance with organizations that have established relationships with the appropriate state offices working on implementing ACA.  VA has identified those states having the largest number of Veterans under the age of 65 and also those under 65 Veterans who self-report as having no health insurance or health coverage. Additional analysis using American Community Survey data assisted the VA in identifying the population that may have new options for health care such as those newly eligible for Medicaid or potentially eligible for the premium tax credit. The VA has identified eight (8) states of interest based on the Veteran population and states' position on expanding Medicaid eligibility and health insurance marketplaces.  The states are: CA, TX, FL, OH, NC, GA, VA and NY.    The VA may identify additional or substitute with other states during coming months.
1.	For those states the VA has identified of interest, VA requests assistance understanding the state's position and approach to expanding Medicaid eligibility and establishing a health insurance marketplace.
2.	For those states the VA has identified, assistance is requested to establish lines of communication and develop opportunities to collaborate with states in order to assist Veterans and families to identify the most appropriate health coverage.
3.	A key challenge is real-time or near real-time reporting for tracking the decisions of Veterans around ACA.  What data systems or data exchanges will assist VA to understand the choices Veterans are making and how might VA need to adjust its communications towards Veterans regarding their potential eligibility for VA health care.
The timeframe for this work to be completed is aggressive.  Items 1 and 2 above need to be completed by July 31, 2013 and item 3 by April 30, 2014.

Special Notice
Synopsis:
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWCCD), through its Surveillance and Electronic Support Systems (SESS) group, has extensive expertise, capabilities, facilities and information in the field of electronic warfare (EW) and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and is in the process of developing potential new applications and capabilities utilizing true time delay, hybrid signal mixing, and autonomous UAV control and testing research and technology.  NSWCCD seeks Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partners that possess the expertise, capabilities, facilities, and experience in any of these areas to explore R&D opportunities with SESS.
  NSWC Crane has been asked to enter into a spin-in CRADA to perform technical assessments and conduct research and development (R&D) on proprietary systems using the above technologies. The specific applications to be explored using these proprietary systems are as follows:

1.  True time delay for radio frequency (RF) signals in an SESS-proposed reprogrammable RF transform system.
2.  True time delay for signals in an SESS-proposed RF beam-steering system utilizing miniature RF transceiver technology. 
3.  Hybrid signal mixing utilizing electrical and optical components in an SESS-proposed RF Field Programmable Gate Array (RF-FPGA) system.  
4.  Autonomous UAV control and testing research and technology for ISR missions to be able to use unmanned systems as an integrated expeditionary sensor and weapon system against asymmetrical threats

This synopsis serves as a sources sought seeking information from companies capable of providing expertise, capabilities, facilities and experience in any of these fields and applications.
  Any group that believes it has the ability to perform the design, development and integration of systems such as these can identify its capabilities by submitting the information to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Surveillance and Electronic Support Systems (code WXT), Attn: Mr. Dave Jenkins, Bldg 3330N, 300 Hwy 361, Crane, IN 47522. Mr. Jenkins can also be reached at 812-854-4136 or dave.g.jenkins@navy.mil. 

Responses are requested by close of business March 20, 2013. After reviewing the responses, NSWCCD may request a meeting or teleconference with responding parties to gain further insight into their capabilities. NSWCCD is not obligated to hold these meetings with any or all respondents.
 If NSWCCD decides to meet with a party, it will only meet with those that responded to this notice. NSWCDD will not reimburse costs for participation in these meetings or teleconferences.  NSWCCD reserves the right to enter into CRADA agreements with no, any or all respondents based upon NSWCCDs judgment of the potential success of collaborative efforts.

There may be a future acquisition directed to some or all of the capabilities which are the subject or focus of this research and development effort. Therefore NSWC Crane desires to avoid or mitigate unfair competitive advantages being conferred on any potential contractor or offeror as a result of CRADA efforts herein which actually or appear to compromise the integrity of the procurement process.
  In particular, NSWC Crane seeks to avoid or mitigate (1) unequal access to information on Government needs and Warfighter evaluations of proprietary systems or improved versions resulting from this CRADA effort; (2) impaired objectivity arising from CRADA partners collaborative efforts with Government employees or Warfighters; and (3) biased ground rules for a possible or potential future acquisition directed to a capability which may be a focus of this CRADA effort.  This effort is expected to produce CRADA subject data deliverables which may be used to facilitate a possible follow-on acquisition using a Name Brand or Equal acquisition strategy, which is designed to ensure a fair competition while respecting the proprietary rights and previous investment of potential CRADA partners.

This is not a procurement, nor a notice for such a procurement, and at this time there is no plan or funding for a follow-on procurement.
 The legal authority for this cooperative research effort is the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified in Title 15 United States Code, Section 3710a, et seq. Under a CRADA, the partner contributes funds, equipment, or in-kind services to the joint research effort, leveraging their efforts with those of the federal agency for a mission-related objective.  At Government discretion, subject data deliverables and inventions delivered under any CRADA agreement may be used in future competitive acquisitions.

Project 675-13-900 A-E Build New Research Lab at Lk Nona is currently on hold till further notice.  This project may move forward through the A-E acquisition process, or the A-E process may restart at a future date.  That decision had not been solidified.  

However, as per the previous Sources Sought notice several qualified SF330s were submitted to the Orlando VA.  A short list of three A-E Firms was developed from the submitted SF330s and those three firms were interviewed.  A ranking was developed and successful negotiations were held with a qualifying A-E Firm.  However, the process was placed on hold prior to awarding to that firm.  
When the acquisition process resumes or is canceled, a posting will be placed on FBO.  Thank you.

If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL - Not Required</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(B) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time.

<a href="mailto:linda.williams11@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking a Contractor to assist with the provision of emergency residential placement and treatment services through the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program. This contract is designed to serve homeless Veterans in need of immediate placement in a safe environment with onsite treatment services.  Many of these veterans have co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and other serious medical conditions. The goal of the HCHV Contract Residential Care Program is to rapidly stabilize Veterans' medical, mental health, substance abuse and other psychosocial problems in order to place Veterans in other appropriate transitional or permanent housing within 60 to 90 days, but no more than 180 days.  VA intends to engage a Contractor to provide rapid placement of VA-referred Veterans in a safe, residential treatment setting while addressing Veterans' complex needs through on-site clinical treatment and case management services.   
Entities that are interested in providing Veterans these services should be aware that although this contract seeks services for the areas covered by the New York / New Jersey Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN3) including New York City, Long Island, Hudson Valley and most of New Jersey, HCHV is a national program serving Veterans throughout the country. This program continues to expand and has become one of the largest VA interventions to assist homeless Veterans. It is also the first specialized homeless program developed by the VA.  It represents one of VA's most significant efforts to achieve the President's goal of ending homelessness among Veterans.
Through this contract, the VA seeks to support homeless Veterans served by HCHV by expediting placement of these Veterans into a safe, residential treatment facility. This facility must meet the criteria established both by HCHV clinical staff and VA fire and safety officials.  Contractors are urged in the strongest terms to carefully review the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work to ensure that all facilities fire and safety and treatment services criteria can be met in a timely way. 
This contract is intended for community based contractors currently operating residential treatment facilities with on-site treatment services and demonstrated experience serving homeless individuals and/or families whereby this contract provides supplemental funding for Veterans to receive immediate placement and enhanced on-site treatment designed to address Veterans' unique and population specific needs.  VA will consider proposals for new residential treatment programs if it can be determined that the contractor can meet all of the terms of the Statement of Work within the required timeframes.  VA places a great deal of emphasis on the responsibility and accountability of contractors receiving VA funds through the HCHV Contract Residential Care program. VA has procedures in place to monitor facilities and treatment services provided to homeless veterans as well as outcomes associated with the services provided in HCHV Contract Residential Care programs.  
Primary target populations for HCHV Contract Residential Care include chronically homeless, chronically mentally ill Veterans, Veterans with chronic substance abuse disorders and/or serious medical problems and complex needs.  The VA is also highly interested in contractors that are able to meet the residential treatment needs of homeless male and/or female Veterans with families and/or minor children as described in the Tasks and Deliverables outlined in the contract, though VA has authority to pay per diem for services to VA health care eligible Veterans only.   Any costs associated with non-VA health care eligible family members cannot be included in the per diem rate for this contract.  Contractors are expected to have other funding sources to cover costs associated with care for non-VA health care eligible family members who may reside in the residential treatment facility with the eligible Veteran.
To be eligible for the HCHV Contract Residential Care program, Veterans must:
"	Be eligible for VA health care as determined by the local VA medical center
"	Be determined to be homeless or at imminent risk for homelessness based on McKinney-Vento Act definitions [see Reference section for additional information] by the local VA medical center HCHV program
"	Be assessed by the HCHV program at the VA medical center to have serious medical, mental health, substance abuse, or other serious psychosocial conditions or stressors that would make the Veteran or Veteran family highly vulnerable to negative consequences in a general population shelter or drop-in setting for homeless people.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(End of Local Clause) <BR> <BR>11.701 -- Supply Contracts. (a) A fixed-price supply contract may authorize Government acceptance of a variation in the quantity of items called for if the variation is caused by conditions of loading, shipping, or packing, or by allowances in manufacturing processes. Any permissible variation shall be stated as a percentage and it may be an increase, a decrease, or a combination of both; however, contracts for subsistence items may use other applicable terms of variation in quantity.
(b) There should be no standard or usual variation percentage. The overrun or underrun permitted in each contract should be based upon the normal commercial practices of a particular industry for a particular item, and the permitted percentage should be no larger than is necessary to afford a contractor reasonable protection. The permissible variation shall not exceed plus or minus 10 percent unless a different limitation is established in agency regulations. Consideration shall be given to the quantity to which the percentage variation applies. For example, when delivery will be made to multiple destinations and it is desired that the quantity variation apply to the item quantity for each destination, this requirement must be stated in the contract.
(c) Contractors are responsible for delivery of the specified quantity of items in a fixed-price contract, within allowable variations, if any. If a contractor delivers a quantity of items in excess of the contract requirements plus any allowable variation in quantity, particularly small dollar value overshipments, it results in unnecessary administrative costs to the Government in determining disposition of the excess quantity. Accordingly, the contract may include the clause at 52.211-17, Delivery of Excess Quantities, to provide that --
(1) Excess quantities of items totaling up to $250 in value may be retained without compensating the contractor; and
(2) Excess quantities of items totaling over $250 in value may,  -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>Background or Problem Statement: NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Regional Office's (PIRO) Marine National Monument Program is participating in the process of developing management plans for three monuments: Rose Atoll, Marianas Trench, and the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments. As NOAA works with its partners to develop short- and long-term management needs for the Marine National Monuments in the Pacific, research priorities will be tailored to meet those needs. An important step in this process includes identifying ecosystem observation and monitoring activities needed to obtain the sound science required to fulfill research priorities and narrow the gaps in ecosystem science knowledge identified in the NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) Marianas Trench Marine National Monument (MTMNM) Ecosystem Science Plan.</p>
<p>The NOAA Fisheries PIRO Monuments Program and PIFSC are planning to hold a workshop in late May/early June 2013 to produce a Mariana Archipelago Ecosystem Implementation Plan by: 1) discussing research priorities, 2) developing research strategies to address knowledge gaps and 3) identify, discuss and evaluate the best available ecosystem monitoring and observation activities to provide the best available science. The workshop will be held in Garapan, Saipan.</p>
<p>Identified research activities will contribute to existing baseline data on the linkages between biological, geophysical, and human components of the MTMNM and Marianas Archipelago Ecosystem and will provide a foundation for science-based management of the MTMNM. This workshop is being planned in consultation with a Steering Committee of local scientists and resource managers from the University of Guam; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Coastal Resource Management program, Department of Environmental Quality, and Department of Fish and Wildlife; the United States National Park Service; and the United States Geological Survey. The workshop consists of 2 days of presentations and discussion on implementation of the workshop, followed by a 1 day add-on activity where proposals will be presented by researchers interested in carrying out their projects aboard a NOAA ship in 2014.</p>
<p>Goal: The goal of this contract is to support NOAA Fisheries PIRO Monuments Program (MP) and PIFSC in developing an implementation plan for the MTMNM Archipelago Ecosystem Science Plan. To achieve this, the contractor's tasks are to secure workshop meeting facilities and travel arrangements for designated participants in coordination with MP and PIFSC.</p>
<p>Scope of Work: <br />The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, travel, materials, equipment, facilities and all other items necessary to completely perform the following Statement of Work and specifications. Government Point of Contact (MP) will initiate coordination between the Contractor and project lead subsequent to the awarding of the contract, at which point planning will commence for the workshop. The following tasks and budget identify what the contractor will be responsible for completing:</p>
<p>Task #1: Workshop Preparation: The contractor shall procure a conference facility suitable for 25-50 attendees in Garapan, Saipan for late May/early June, 2013. The Contractor will work with the MP and PIFSC project leads to identify appropriate venues based on the meeting/event needs, format, and the anticipated attendance of participants. The conference will occur over a 3-day period, for approximately 8 hours per day. Some flexibility in dates and times may be possible, but must be agreed upon by the PIRO Monuments Program and PIFSC project leads. Facility should have A/V capabilities, including projector, screens, laptop, and preferably, wireless internet. The venue and rates shall be approved by the MP and PIFSC project leads prior to booking.</p>
<p>Task #2: Participant Travel Logistics<br />The contractor shall organize roundtrip travel and accommodations for up to 5 workshop participants, to be identified by MP and PIFSC project leads. Participants will be based in Guam and will be traveling to Saipan for the workshop. The contractor will procure necessary travel arrangements (including airline tickets, shuttle services to/from hotel, lodging, and reimbursement for meals and incidental expenses) for identified participants. Travel should occur in a window no more than 1 day prior to the workshop (arrival) and 1 day following the workshop (departure). All prices shall be approved by the MP and PIFSC project leads prior to booking. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that participants complete all of their necessary paperwork for reimbursement of their costs.</p>
<p><br />Deliverables for Identified Tasks:</p>
<p>Task #1<br />Meeting and Event Planning:<br />&bull; Within 30 days of notice to proceed, the Contractor will provide a memo to appropriate MP and PIFSC project leads identifying the following agreed upon information:<br />o Identified meeting venue, rates and dates.<br />o Agreed upon Contract staff and materials to be provided for the project.<br />&bull; Contractor will provide electronic or written confirmation to MP and PIFSC project leads that all logistical components have been identified and secured for the upcoming meetings and events. <br />o Confirmation shall include appropriate contact information for the MP and PIFSC staff member for onsite personnel providing the venue and services.</p>
<p>Task # 2<br />Participant Travel Logistics:<br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide all agreed upon logistical services for meetings/events.<br />o Within 30 days of notice to proceed, the contractor must make contact with participants identified by the MP and PIFSC leads. <br />o Within 45 days of notice to proceed, the contractor will provide a memo to appropriate MP and PIFSC project leads documenting the status of travel planning for each identified participant. <br />o All travel must be secured no less than 30 days prior to workshop (workshop dates estimated for May 21-23, 2013).</p>
<p>Task Type:</p>
<p>Transportation and Travel:<br />Travel in support of the listed tasks is not authorized unless agreed upon by the MP/PIFSC project lead. If authorized, Contractor shall be paid as a direct cost in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance for this project is from contract issuance date to 1 year from the issuance date or until project associated funding is expended, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Proposal Requirements:</p>
<p>Responses to the RFP are due by March 20, 2013 and should include the following:<br />1. The Contractor should have relatively recent previous experience coordinating travel and logistics for meetings or issues related to NOAA Fisheries jurisdiction.<br />2. The Contractor shall provide contact information for 3 references. Evaluators shall contact references to guarantee that the Contractor has a good reputation in the Pacific Islands region for conducting logistics and travel work.<br />3. A cost estimate, including hourly rate overhead, broken down by major expense categories.</p>
<p>Cost Evaluation</p>
<p>Each cost proposal in the competitive range will be subjected to a cost evaluation. For the purposes of this procurement, technical factors and past performance are considered to be significantly more important than cost. However, in the event the proposals of two or more offerors receive scores so close as to be essentially equal, cost may become more important in determining which offer provides the best value to the Government. Therefore, the Government may in its considered judgment, based on overall technical, past performance and cost considerations, make an award to the offeror submitting the best-value offer.</p>
<p>NOAA FISHERIES PIRO requests that the Contracting Officer participate in the Evaluation of qualified vendors.</p>
<p>Government-Furnished Equipment, Badge, Keys, and/or Facilities provided.<br />All necessary equipment and supplies will be provided by Contractor to enable the completion of assigned tasks. The agenda and printed materials required for the conference will be supplied by NOAA Fisheries.</p>
<p><br />Information Security in Acquisitions:<br />Data supplied for and produced by this contract is not privileged and the level of security required is low. The C&amp;A requirements of Clause 48 CFR 1352.239-72 do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">General Services Administration&rsquo;s (GSA) Greater Southwest Region has a need for electric power to operate its federal government owned and occupied buildings located within deregulated areas of the Texas ERCOT marketplace. Buildings are located in the Oncor, AEP, AEP North and Centerpoint (lines and wires) transmission and delivery service delivery areas.&nbsp; GSA is seeking cost effective proposals providing mostly <strong>renewable energy</strong> to be delivered to GSA facilities.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The successful offeror will supply electricity, scheduling, transmission, billing, and other related and ancillary services for either 60 or 120 monthly billing cycles generally beginning with the next available meter read after contract award, the current contract expires July 31, 2013.&nbsp; The approximate one year electric requirement is 124,000,000 kWh.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The government is seeking a fixed price flat rate contract for an optimal term of ten years.&nbsp; The Government will also request pricing for a five year term.&nbsp; Given the volatility of fuel costs and electricity prices, and the difficulty of determining where natural gas and other generation fuel markets are headed in the future, GSA requires stable supply and pricing. GSA has decided to address these issues by procurement of reliable, price stable and economically feasible electric energy, with consideration being given to clean renewable energy to supply its facilities. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The Government is looking for pricing on 100% of its requirements and this will be a requirements contract when awarded. The Government&rsquo;s preference is to award 100% of the power to be supplied by renewable energy. However, bids will also be accepted for 50% renewable and 100% conventionally generated electric power and award will be made to either of these if the 100% renewable price is not considered fair and reasonable.<span style="color: red;"></span></span></p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>Additional information/clarification:
<p>The optical table where the light rail will be mounted consists of two 8 ft x 4 ft x 18 inches thick Newport Research Corp optical tables, bolted together on their short end so the combination is 16' x 4'.</p>
<p><br />Regarding the encoder head interface cables, see the paragraph 4.16 from the procurement spec:</p>
<p>4.16 Each display or displays shall include a mount that is bolted to<br />the lab's optical table's 1" &frac14;-20 grid outside the light tight <br />enclosure so that the position of each encoder can be seen by an <br />operator standing to the side of the linear encoder rail system.</p>
<p>The cables will have to be long enough so that the 4 shuttles with encoders can travel the full length of the rail and reach the display mount specified in 4.16 above. The display(s) should be mounted about 2 ft from the end of the table, which will be about 2 ft from the end of the rail. Please see the suggested display position in the attachment, which should help potential offerors determine the required cable length.</p>

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE:  <br>  <br> Solicitation W91WAW-12-R-0087 for the Army Modeling and Simulation Office (AMSO) providing support to identify, prioritize, integrate, and overall synchronization of modeling and simulation capabilities across the Army has been adversely impacted by sequestration. Moreover, and very importantly, the responsibility for this proposed acquisition no longer resides with Army Contracting Command - National Capital Region (ACC-NCR), and is transferring to Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN).   In addition, solicitation changes are expected and may be so significant that a new solicitation is desirable.  Accordingly, no resultant contract award will be made at this time.  Therefore, in accordance with FAR 15.206 (e), solicitation W91WAW-12-R-0087 is hereby cancelled in the best interest of the Government.     Potential offerors will be given an opportunity to submit offers on any resolicitation of this requirement or any future requirements for these services.  Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website for a presolicitation synopsis.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

Questions regarding the workshop may be submitted by email to nbafprogrammanager@dhs.gov ATTN: Mary Goobic. <br />Scope of the BDM<br />The BDM is designed to support the early development and eventual license of products/reagents discovered at the NBAF laboratory. The goal of the BDM is to provide product quality assurance, master cell and seed stocks, upscale validation, and assay development to support the development of biologics, which will allow quicker regulatory reviews and approvals of materials and products to respond to potential emergencies and threats to national and global food stocks. The BDM would address critical needs, including pilot manufacturing processes to effectively transfer new technologies to the veterinary biologics and biopharmaceutical industries and, in some emergency situations, to the end users in the field to control and eradicate a foreign animal disease outbreak. <br />One of the limitations of moving animal health research results to agribusiness is the cost and inefficiencies in developing the manufacturing process; this is an even a bigger issue for foreign animal diseases since there is a limited market for countermeasures developed to control diseases that do not exist in the United States. The BDM will enable the federal government (USDA-ARS, USDA-APHIS, and DHS) to implement early product development initiatives in partnership with private sector greatly increase the rate of success of technology transfers. The BDM will be constructed to enable Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and support translational studies by producing test materials to develop potential therapeutic and preventive countermeasures for animal agriculture. The BDM will support customers from all three NBAF user groups (DHS S&amp;T, ARS, and APHIS) as well as potential industry collaborators. The proposed BDM is intended to produce small scale GMP-compliant biological countermeasures for supporting efficacy studies and early phase clinical trials in response to DHS and USDA program requests. The BDM has been designed to manufacture experimental diagnostics, biologics, and therapeutics designed for the detection, control, and eradication of foreign animal diseases in the United States. These countermeasures may also be used to help developing countries control and where feasible eradicate endemic agents that pose a threat to United States animal agriculture. The model for the GMP/BDM facility, and its supporting areas, is to create small quantities of materials beyond proof of concept, using clinical processing to provide consistent/reproducible products and processes to confirm product safety and effectiveness. The design of the GMP/BDM Suite will support clinical investigations focusing on product safety, purity, potency, and efficacy that will lead to licensed products in compliance with U.S. regulations as well as international standards. The BDM's design will provide flexibility for a variety of product types and manufacturing processes, including production of monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins for therapeutics/diagnostic applications, and live or inactivated recombinant viral and bacterial vaccines, and dedicated areas for formulations and aseptic fill-finish operations. The development of qualified master cell and seed stocks (for manufacturing viral and bacterial vaccines) will be a critical activity to accomplish the mission. In addition, the facility will support the evolution of existing countermeasures (vaccine and diagnostic) programs by providing small scale production of experimental test materials for use in the clinical and analytical components of late stage discovery and early stage development of countermeasures discovered by NBAF scientists.<br />Operational Requirements<br />The BDM is designed as part of the NBAF laboratory to support the growth, collection, and purification of products in individual Production and Diagnostic Reagent Production Suites. The BDM is 8,300 square feet and consists of production suites and general support spaces for small scale production of biological countermeasure materials for supporting efficacy studies and early phase clinical trials. By implementing validated processes to reproduce materials consistently, the program will hasten candidate technology transfer and countermeasure product candidate transition from NBAF to industry partners for scale-up and commercial manufacturing. This will also allow for more targeted outsourcing of countermeasures development processes, as candidates emerging from the NBAF will be more attractive to the animal biologics industry. <br />The BDM will meet the APHIS Center for Veterinary Biologics requirements for manufacturing biological products and will have the flexibility, when necessary, to operate in accordance with current GMP regulations as described in Title 21 CFR Parts 210, and 211, such as during the production of master seeds, drug substances (DS), and drug products (DP). The NBAF BDM will allow the production of pilot lots of veterinary biological candidates to be tested to assess their potential for successful licensure by the APHIS Center of Veterinary Biologics, and will be produced under APHIS manufacturing requirements. APHIS has issued a comprehensive set of regulations governing the licensing of viruses, serums, toxins, or analogous products (9 CFR Parts 101-123). These regulations broadly categorize viruses, serums, toxins or analogous products as "biological products" at any stage of production intended for use in the treatment of animals and act primarily through the direct stimulation, supplementation, enhancement, or modulation of the immune system or immune response. Additional veterinary drugs or products will be submitted to and licensed by the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. Candidates will be manufactured in compliance with the appropriate CFR requirements for the conduct of controlled and uncontrolled studies utilizing active components in animal models. <br />The BDM will operate to enable positive and negative air flows, as well as BSL-2 containment with BSL-3 enhanced production areas to support the development of inactivated and attenuated recombinant viral products. The BDM will be utilized 24 hours a day, based on a year-round production schedule once fully operational. The facility will also allow simultaneous production of small amounts of multiple vaccine candidates. The BDM is attached to the NBAF laboratory to assure proximity. Card/Access Security Control will be established to maintain access control to the building as well as each of the manufacturing suites and access corridors of the GMP/BDM. Proximity Card access will be established to assure that only properly trained and security authorized personnel are allowed in each of the zoned areas of the module. Card access will also be used to maintain the clean zones and material and equipment transfer into the manufacturing suites. <br />Air cleanliness classifications are established in the GMP/BDM per ISO and International EU requirements for possible DS and DP exposure. Open product manufacturing, processing, and fill-finish will be performed under laminar flow classified room air or within containment via biosafety cabinets (BSC) or laminar flow (LAF) hoods to assure product integrity. Air cleanliness will be maintained within the product exposure areas under Class 100/A, ISO 5 conditions. Cleanliness of this air will be maintained through cascade of classifications in adjacent areas required to maintain flow of material, equipment, and personnel through the space. These classifications will be maintained for cleanliness requirements and containment requirements of the CDC, and the FDA for materials in use and products manufactured or finished. Pressurization of spaces to supplement air flows will also be utilized to assure containment of particulates, contaminants, and regulated agents.<br />Utilization Alternatives <br />DHS plans to operate the BDM as a government owned, government operated (GOGO) laboratory. However, DHS is evaluating utilization alternatives for the BDM that will maximize the use of the facility. DHS is seeking feedback from industry on utilization alternatives or alternative approaches such as privatizing the construction and operations of the BDM. <br />The key criteria that DHS is considering in its evaluation are: <br />&bull; Facility and Scientific Oversight<br />&bull; Ability to Respond to Changing Mission<br />&bull; Facility Availability<br />&bull; Ability to Establish Collaborations<br />&bull; Safety and Security<br />&bull; Technology Transfer<br />&bull; Cost Effectiveness<br />&bull; Outside Funding<br />&bull; Risk of Failure/Bankruptcy <br />&bull; Liability<br />DHS would like feedback on other criteria that should be considered in the decision making process. <br />Mechanisms to Facilitate Collaboration with Industry <br />The BDM presents opportunities to further collaborate with industry partners in the development of countermeasures to protect animal agriculture in the United States, as well as developing countries that are endemic for priority diseases that pose a threat to global food security. The BDM will enable and facilitate technology transfer to national and multinational industry partners and contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) for scale-up and quicker turnover to commercial product manufacturing. The importance of on-site potential for development and scale-up production of material has been recognized by DHS and USDA as an important capability for the site as an integral step towards the development of countermeasures. Additional feedback or suggestions on other potential opportunities for collaboration are welcome.<br />NBAF Mission <br />The United States' food and animal agriculture supply is a highly integrated, open, global, and complex infrastructure. Increased imports of agricultural products, climate change, and growing numbers of international travelers to and from the U.S. have opened our food supply to possible intentional, natural, or accidental foreign animal disease outbreaks. The recent pandemic H1N1 outbreak and other regional foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks have demonstrated the vulnerabilities present when there is a lack of available countermeasures, and other rapid response capabilities to curb outbreak disease. The food and agriculture industries are a significant contributor to U.S. economic prosperity; therefore, the loss of a significant food market would have dire economic and potentially human health consequences. To supply the needed capabilities, the DHS and the USDA have the joint responsibility to protect our Nation's animal agriculture and public health from these threats. The DHS is leading these efforts through the construction of the NBAF in Manhattan, Kansas. <br />NBAF will be a state-of-the-art biocontainment facility for the study of foreign animal, emerging and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten the U.S. animal agriculture and public health. NBAF will provide and strengthen our nation with critical capabilities to conduct research, develop vaccines and other countermeasures, and train veterinarians in preparedness and response against these diseases. For the past 50 years, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) has served our nation as the primary facility to conduct research on livestock diseases. However, PIADC is nearing the end of its life-cycle and needs to be replaced in order to meet U.S. research requirements and ensure the timely development of countermeasures in the event of an outbreak. NBAF meets that need and will serve as a replacement for the PIADC facility. Strategically, NBAF will boast of new and expanded capabilities, specifically, Biosafety Level (BSL) 4 containment for the study of high-consequence diseases affecting livestock and people. Specifically, NBAF will meet its mission by 1) providing enhanced capabilities to research, rapidly detect, and provide training on foreign animal, emerging and zoonotic diseases in livestock; 2) providing expanded vaccine and countermeasure development capabilities; and 3) replacing and expanding research currently performed at the PIADC in Orient Point, New York while continuing the partnership between the DHS and the USDA-ARS and USDA-APHIS.<br />NBAF will serve as a U.S. government facility capable of rapidly producing experimental biological, diagnostic, and vaccine related products for potential use by USDA in an outbreak of an emerging or foreign animal disease. Initially, the following diseases would be studied at NBAF and would also require BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory capabilities: Nipah Virus, Hendra Virus, African Swine Fever, Rift Valley Fever, Japanese Encephalitis Virus, Foot and Mouth Disease, Classical Swine Fever, and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia. The pathogens studied at the NBAF may change based upon continued evaluation of risks to U.S. agricultural system.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation; Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators; Instrumentation Management Office in partnership with the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program has a requirement to provide a Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC).  JUTC will include a set of urban test capabilities comprised of a representative Live Urban Area, Augmented Urban Environment (UE) Effects (AUEE), Virtual and Constructive UE (VCUE), Data Collection, Reduction, and Analysis (DCRA), Test Planning and Control, Test Architecture and Net-Centric Interoperability, Weapon System Urban Test Capability, Communications Jamming Urban Test Capability, and Infrared Counter Measure System Urban Test Capability.  This project will provide Developmental Test and Operational Test capabilities through modularity and layering to create varied representative urban morphologies and test support capabilities.  The first increment to be developed will include a portion of the Live Urban Area, the AUEE, VCUE, DCRA, Test Planning and Control, Test Architecture and Net-Centric Interoperability, and will be located at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  Other JUTC requirements, such as live environments at China Lake and remaining virtual and constructive environments for WSMR, Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, and Naval Air Station Patuxent River, will be addressed in later increments.  <br>    <br>  This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is being issued to determine industry capabilities and identify potential sources for the procurement of JUTC Increment 1.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) and draft Performance Specification are provided for your review and to assist you in determining your interest in participating.  The Government requests that you provide your expression of interest by submitting a capability statement regarding the requirements included in the draft SOW/Performance Specification as follows:  <br>    <br>  Cover Page:  Include a cover sheet with the company name, address, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact with name, title, phone number, and email address.  Also indicate the SSN title and number.  <br>    <br>  Format:  Font shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman.  Electronic submissions shall be in MS Word format.  Only electronic submissions are acceptable. The Government is not soliciting proprietary information; however, if submitted, it should be appropriately marked.   <br>    <br>  Length:  Do not exceed five pages, exclusive of the cover page.  In addition, up to three attachments may be included that consist of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature.  <br>    <br>  Size of Business:  Provide a statement indicating if your firm is a large or small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code identified below.  Small businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-14 - Limitation of Subcontracting, regarding contract performance.  Please identify how you plan to comply if the acquisition is set aside.  If you are a small business only interested in subcontracting opportunities, please identify the areas you are interested in supporting.  If a small business, identify if you are disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Women-owned Business, or Hub-zone.    <br>    <br>  Your capability statement should demonstrate relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for JUTC Increment 1 as described in the draft Performance Specification.  The capability statement should contain sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities.  <br>    <br>  Respondents are asked to submit replies no later than 3:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 21, 2013 by email to sherry.alexander@us.army.mil with a courtesy copy to Mr. Michael Landers (michael.landers@us.army.mil). In addition to your capability statement, you are invited to submit questions/comments as a result of your review of the draft SOW and draft Performance Specification.  Please provide your questions in a separate attachment from your capability statement.  There is no specified format; however, please use 12-point Times New Roman and submit electronically in MS Word.  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates a competitive, Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this effort.  The NAICS designation for this acquisition is currently 333318 - Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  If industry has suggestions for possible NAICS codes that better fit this requirement, please identify them in your capability statement.    <br>    <br>  This action does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure the subject products, services or information.  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any supplies or services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  This information is for program planning and acquisition strategy development.  <br>    <br>  NOTE: Previous information regarding this program is posted as a Special Notice under the same Solicitation Number: W900KK13R0001 and is still available for review.   <br>   <br> The RAGE Operations Manual referenced in paragraph 2.2 of the Draft Performance Specification is being provided to assist in your analysis of the JUTC Increment 1 effort.

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 17 - 671 - South Texas Veterans Health Care System intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 17 - 671 - South Texas Veterans Health Care System is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p><span>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to issue a contract modification to extend the period of performance of contract HQ0006-07-D-0005 for a five year period, ending 6 September 2017. The contract is for Translated GPS Range System (TGRS), and the contractor is L3 Communications, Interstate Electronics Corporation (IEC), located in Anaheim California. There will be no increase or decrease of the estimated cost or fee of the contract.</span></p>
<p>The purpose of the contract is to continue to fulfill all MDA TGRS requirements. The TGRS requirements include: (1) mission support services, (2) procurement of new production TGRS equipment including Digital Global Positioning System Translators (DGTs), GPS Translator Processors (GTPs), GTP Control Units, Data Archive Units, Pre-track Signal Recorders, and GTP Upgrade kits, and (3) RDT&amp;E support to include system upgrades, spares, maintenance and repairs, and other related studies and analyses.</p>
<p>The TGRS obtains GPS Time, Space and Position Information (TSPI), and can provide independent tracking data for both interceptor and for the target vehicle. The TGRS provides this information using signals from the GPS space vehicles. The TGRS provides for real time line-of-sight (LOS) tracking and recording of high quality pre-track GPS signals for enhanced post flight trajectory reconstruction for MDA tests involving intercept and kinetic kill impact of a target vehicle. The TGRS is a mandatory instrumentation resource that must be in place, in accordance with program schedules, so that MDA tests are not delayed by reason of its absence. Given TGRS is a mandatory range safety asset for MDA flight tests with tight schedules, MDA must ensure that range assets necessary for program testing are sustained and in place in accordance with program requirements and schedules. The MDA estimates that it would take at least 36 months for another team to provide equivalently successful capabilities to meet all of MDA TGRS requirements. At this time, there are only 4 remaining flight tests on the manifest scheduled to use this capability through 2017. After a transition to the winning offeror on a competition, there would only be one remaining flight test. There would be little opportunity to recoup the development costs for a new source, therefore, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), the Government intends to extend the ordering period for the current contract through 6 September 2017. The anticipated award date for this contract modification is 31 December 2012.</p>

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($3K to $150K)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20; 1495 Wilmington Dr., Suite 360, DuPont, WA. 98327.

2.	Nature of the Action Being Processed: This action is a Justification and Approval for restricting competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement will be awarded as a new purchase order on a firm-fixed price basis.  In accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: This procurement under PR # 648-13-2-6999-0005 is for assisted parking services at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (PVAMC).  It has a requirement to park an additional 100 employee vehicles at the Portland campus.  This is due to the closure of surface parking Lot # 13 (77 parking spaces), which is undergoing construction to become a parking structure.  In addition to the existing striped parking stalls at the campus, the contractor shall direct employees to park an additional 100 vehicles at the PVAMC main campus.  Assisted parking is intended for VA employees only.  The contractor shall not park patient, visitor, and volunteers.

The total estimated value of this acquisition is $48,000.00.  This is for a four month Purchase Order.

The period of performance is 1 March 2013 - 30 June 2013.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition: The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is urgency.  The requirement was not synopsized IAW FAR 5.101 due to urgency.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): The contractor (Star Park, LLC) is currently performing the work.  The contractor has no exclusions and is currently active in SAM.  The contractor's D&B score is 4, which is low risk.  The contractor has been performing satisfactory or better, in regards to the Statement of Work.  There have been no reported incidents with the contractor.  Due to the costs of resoliciting the requirements and the time frame needed for this temporary service; it is more advantageous to the government to award to the contractor, Star Park, LLC.


6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104: The requirement was not synopsized IAW 5.101 due to urgency.  Though formal competition was not sought by means of FedBizOpps, the service line and contract specialist conducted brief market research in an effort to obtain quotes.  Market research showed two other potential vendors, in addition to the known vendor, that may be capable of providing the required services.  One of the vendors was not found in SAM, and therefore, was not pursued for a quote.
 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW FAR 13.106-3: The anticipated total dollar amount of the proposed acquisition is estimated for a total of $48,000.00.  The contractor's price quote was 1% lower than the IGCE, which was $48,510.00.  The monthly rate is comparable to the previously awarded contract # VA260-12-P-0135.  The Purchase Order # VA648-Z25000 was in the amount of $108,000.00.  Based on this data, the price is found to be fair and reasonable.
 
8.
