<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Aviation Weather Associates, Inc (AWA) to provide support services for the Weather Integrated Product Team of the Joint Planning and Development Office. This contract will bridge a shortfall in contract support to the Weather IPT to continue to provide technical support services.  A single source contract for a 9 month period of performance in the amount of $176,000 is planned. AWA is small company which has been providing scientific and technical consulting services in support of the Integrated Product Teams (IPT) Leadership Team and Executive Committee.  The company employee serving as Chief Scientist is a nationally recognized expert in the field of aviation meteorology and possesses a unique combination of skills needed to satisfy the IPT's requirement to develop plans for the transformation of aviation meteorological services in a timely manner with no learning curve.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the FAA to acquire these services on a single source basis to AWA for the following reasons:  AWA has been instrumental in the development of the Weather IPT vision, strategy and plans for demonstration test cases that will be utilized to conduct ongoing evaluations and has extensive knowledge regarding national airspace service functionality.  This expertise has proven to be extremely valuable in the development of the demonstration project scenarios. AWA also has unique knowledge regarding the existing and proposed meteorological approaches used by several agencies of the JPDO.  This familiarity with the current state of aviation weather research and its applicability to the weather IPT integrated capability work plans is essential to achieving several near term JPDO deadlines.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Sue Handy, Contracting Officer by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Time, August 22, 2006.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, LANDFIRE and GAP projects require vegetation data for mapping. The map units must be delineated accurately on a map using remote sensing techniques combined with biophysical modeling. The map units must fit into the framework of landscape simulation models critical to modeling potential fire behavior and fire effects as well as historical fire regimes and their effects on landscape vegetation characteristics. Map units also must be flexible with regard to floristic scale, arranged into multiple hierarchical levels, and allow for linkage to local classifications which will enable managers to step down their maps to finer scales using the methods, tools and reference data provided by LANDFIRE. The map classes must be readily identified in the field and from compiled field data or from existing databases and must be identified by standardized terminology used in ecological classification and description. The proposed contract would be for remaining areas that border the western United States, the remaining coterminous (central and eastern) United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Z-Construction Manager as constructor (CMc), GT “Mickey” Leland Federal Building, Houston, TX POC Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer; telephone #817/978-6163; fax # 817/978-7194; e-mail address: carrie.haman@gsa.gov DESC: NAICS CODE 236220 - Solicitation No. GS-07P-06-URC-0064, Project No. ITX00214.  CMc shall provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases. The team includes GSA as owner/developer, and GSA's selected A-E firm (Rey de la Reza, Houston, TX). THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and optional Construction Phase Services.  The base contract shall consist of the pre-construction phase services.  The CMc's price for construction phase services shall be priced as an option exercisable by the Government when the design is complete and funding is available.  Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but will not be limited to, review and evaluation of the design development and construction document submissions for constructability, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, cost estimates and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.  Optional Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, construction of the building renovations, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintenance of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, weekly report for special issues, monitoring of construction costs, commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff and other required supplemental services, if so requested by the Government.  Project Scope: Replace and upgrade window systems, significant improvements and upgrades to the outdoor plaza, installation of a new breezeway and garage improvements, interior upgrades inclusive of finish throughout public spaces and ADA upgrades to all floors without compliant restrooms, significant improvements to the HVAC system, and elevator modernization.  Summary of the Acquisition Strategy: The contract will be Firm Fixed-Price and Source Selection procedures under FAR Part 15 will be employed as the method of selection of the successful Offeror.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Stage process.  Technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price.  Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past performance and personnel. The technical proposals will be evaluated based on pre-established evaluation factors and short listing will be established.  Those offerors who are short listed will be provided with the Stage II RFP, which will include a detailed scope of services, the preliminary housing plan and other information needed to submit an offer. Firms that respond to the RFP will be required in Stage II to submit pricing in accordance with FAR 15.403 and the RFP.  Short listed firms will be required to provide oral presentations in Ft. Worth, TX using proposed team members.  The contract may be awarded on the basis of the Stage II submissions or the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) may request Final Revised Proposals.  If discussions are conducted, offerors will be advised in accordance with FAR 15.306(d)(3) of technical deficiencies and significant weaknesses noted by the technical advisors and the SSEB.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on Stage II proposals without holding discussions or conducting negotiations.  The method for the proposal evaluation will be the "best value" method, with the technical proposal (including all factors) more important than price.  After technical and price evaluations, discussions and/or negotiations and Final Revised Proposals (FRP), if required, the SSEB will make recommendation to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) of the Offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government.  Source Selection Evaluation Criteria: The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA's SSEB In evaluating offerors’ potential as viable competitors.  The evaluation factors for Stage I are as follows: (1) Past Performance in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects; (2) Experience in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects and (3) Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.  The evaluation factors for Stage II are as follows: (1) Project Management Plan:  The Project Management Plan will include such information as project staffing, communication, safety plan, coordination, quality control plan, scheduling, monitoring/controlling costs, problem resolution and utilization of "sustainable" methods and materials in construction, etc. (2) Subcontracting Plan: provide a subcontracting plan indicating subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, woman-owned small business, veteran and disabled veteran-owned business, 8(a) small business and HUB Zone small business to participate in this contract.  A subcontracting plan must be provided with the proposal.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  Price Range: The estimated range of construction cost is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Congress is expected to furnish construction funds for this project by FY 2008.  A Pre-proposal conference to discuss the scope requirements will be held in Houston at a location and a time determined later.  The date and location will be advertised in a forthcoming FedBizOps announcement.  Anticipated Award: The Government anticipates award of this contract by December 15, 2006.  Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin approximately 18 months after award.  The Government does not guarantee award within this period nor shall the Government be liable for any costs should award occur before or after this period.  Completion Date: The entire facility must be substantially complete within 730 calendar days from the notice to proceed date of the Construction Phase Option.  The Contractor shall identify a guaranteed delivery date within this time frame.  The guaranteed delivery date must include a 30-day period for complete inspection and testing of all systems and improvements which are to be paid for and conducted by the CMc, including the correction of documented punch list items and schedule contingencies.  Offerors expressing interest will be requested to respond to the RFP with submission of information outlined in the Stage I RFP.  Those firms short listed by GSA shall be requested to provide additional information in response to the Stage II RFP.  Firms that do not submit written responses to this notice for Stage II will not be eligible to compete in subsequent stages of this procurement.  Access to documents: Interested parties shall contact the Contracting Officer to obtain a copy of the Document Security Notice.

As part of this effort, there is a current need for a contractor to provide  subject matter experts to conduct a 4-month study base lining and evaluating existing procedures, organization, equipment, personnel, applicable directives, and training associated with the records management at DARPA.  After the contractor has evaluated the existing records management system, it will make recommendations on new, or changes to, procedures, equipment, personnel, organization, and training to effect a more responsive records management system with growth potential.  This announcement is a follow-on to RFI SN 05-17 (Task 3) posted to FedBizOpps (FBO) on 20 DEC 2004.  Evaluation of responses to that RFI has resulted in a determination to make this RFQ a 100% set-aside for service-disabled veteran-owned (SDVO) small business concerns.  NAICS code 541611/SBA size standard of $6 million applies.  DARPA anticipates the award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order.  Current Secret Clearance is desired but not required.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting proposals using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). 

The purpose of this procurement is to train State and local MCH officials in the use of multi-level modeling in the statistical analysis of preterm birth or low birth weight data available in the public domain. The emphasis of the project is on the training of state/local public health partners in the benefits, use, interpretation, and implementation of the multilevel modeling analysis technique in the investigation of preterm birth or infant low birth weight and fetal growth in their respective public health departments using the respective state or local data.  Partnering with a state/local public health agency, the training will consist of the benefits and methods of analyzing multidimensional and contextual factors related to racial disparity in preterm birth or low birth weight using multi-level statistical models applied to state and local public health data.  It is anticipated that a better understanding concerning the environmental context of disparities in health outcomes obtained with this type of analysis will lead to more effective public health interventions and the identification of appropriate collaborations between public health and other sectors of the community.  The project will plan, collect, and analyze appropriate state and local data, and summarize the implications and recommendations for future state/local MCH policy and program development.  There will also be collaboration with other researchers who are performing similar analyses of health disparities in preterm birth.  This collaboration will yield pooled data that represents a wide range of community level factors to be used in the contextual analysis.

The contractor shall: 1) Finalize the research design; 2) Analyze data; 3) Prepare and conduct the training; 4) Manage logistics requirements; and 5) Prepare various reports.

THE SOLICITATION is attached to this web posting.
	
ALL QUESTIONS about this requirement must be submitted by email to abroider@hrsa.gov no later than 10:00 AM local prevailing time on August 22, 2006.  Responses to questions will be posted at this site.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Part 12. and FAR Parts 13.5 and 19 as this procurement is a total small business set-aside.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCG23-06-R-PRZ013, which is a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The NAICS code is 541512.  The proposed contract is 100% Set-Aside for Small Business concerns.  Small Business Average Annual Receipts is $23.0.  The Period of Performance for this requirement will be for one year with four one-year option periods.  A Firm-Fixed-Price contract is anticipated.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has a need for secure, real-time, web-based electronic testing services for “End-of-Course” testing of the USCG Workforce.  Testing services include development and implementation of proctored, self-service, electronic testing that provides immediate results to the member and other USCG systems.  The services are to be hosted internally in a Government-managed server environment.  The USCG Institute (CGI) has been designed by the Personnel Manual, COMDTINST M1000.6(series) to oversee the distribution of course material and exams, including end of course tests, and to oversee the grading of these exams.  Under this authority, the CGI published CGI Publication 1550.1 in June 2003 for all policies and procedures for correspondence end of course testing.  The “End of Course Tests” (EOCT) is knowledge-based examinations designed to discriminate the level of comprehension a member has acquired of course material for a specific job.  Members are required to take and pass specific tests prior to becoming eligible for promotion to the next grade.  In addition, some tests are required before members can receive certain qualifications.  These tests mark the termination of a “study at your own pace” course.  They are administered by the Education Service Officer (ESO) according to CG Personnel Manual COMDTINST M1000.6A: Article 5.C.8.  Members must pass specific course tests in order to advance, (i.e., placed on supplemental or Service Wide qualification list) or qualify for certain positions.  These tests show the member has mastered the skills required for the new position.  Test results are then fed into the Direct Access (Oracle/Peoplesoft Human Resource Software Application) and other systems for use by decision makers (Coast Guard Personnel Service) (PSC) -advancements, USCG Personnel Command (CGPC)-Assignment Officers.  Under the current manual system, the process is to test the member, select a qualified candidate and then fill a billet, takes more than 21 days on average.  The USCG currently uses Progress, an antiquated paper-based testing system.  Progress is labor intensive since every aspect of testing is done manually. The USCG seeks a technologically advanced method of testing in order to maximize very limited resources and improve efficiency.  The USCG currently uses GEMINI as a test item database.  This product delivers only a paper test to be utilized with the Progress database.  

The Contractor shall provide pricing for the software package, all licenses and support in accordance with the requirements provided in the solicitation.

CSD extends the FORCEnet construct to stealthy undersea Navy platforms with the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of these platforms in achieving the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) SEAPOWER 21 vision.  Currently, the Navy is interested in the development and/or production of a Family of Systems including Buoyant Cable Antenna with High Frequency Internet Protocol (BCA w/HF IP), Untethered Expendable Communications Buoy (UECB), Tethered Expendable Communications Buoy (TECB), Tactical Paging Buoy (TPB), and Buoy Interface Unit (BIU).   It is requested that industry review the attached draft specifications (posted at SPAWAR E-Commerce website) for each type of buoy and provide questions/comments as to the Government's requirements including, but not limited to: completeness, technical feasibility and any data right issues.  Questions/comments may be submitted via email to Karen Rainville at karen.rainville@navy.mil or may be submitted via the SPAWAR e- commerce site.

Since the late l950's the contracted Dwights and PI well service companies to provide such information on well completions as well as production data on individual wells or wells committed to unitization or communitization agreements.  About 19 years ago, IHS Energy Group bought Dwight's/PI and BLM has established yearly contracts with IHS to provide such data on CD ROMS, with monthly updates. IHS is the only known service company that provides such data.  IHS system provides input of data on well completions and production history into their system almost instantaneously. Continuing our contact with IHS without interruption is critical to the operation and management of BLM's fluid minerals program.  Specifically, their Historical and Production Data CD's are much needed to: 1.	Determine whether and to what extent oil and gas resources are valuable in developing land use plans, 2.	Determine if any Federal or Indian oil and gas leases are subject to drainage by well producing on nearby lands. 3.	Ensure that public and Indian mineral interest owners receive their proper share of  oil and gas resources in unitiziation, communitization, and other agreements. 4.	Conduct fair market fair assessment of Indian oil and gas lease sale parcel. 5.	Determine if Indian oil and gas leases are being diligently developed. 6.	And to do paying well determinations for oil and gas drainage cases, Indian diligence, and agreements using available automated software. 7.	To do sample estimates the amount of helium resources that are contained in oil and gas wells on a nationwide basis. Continuing to purchase well data CD's through a Total U.S. coverage arrangement is the most cost effective means of ensuring that oil and gas well data is provided to BLM Field Offices in a timely, accurate, and efficient manner.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. It is not a solicitation or a request for offers. No solicitation package is available

<SUBJECT>A -- Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT), Regional Clinical Centers
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-HR-06-07
<RESPDATE>013106
<CONTACT>Joanne Deshler, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-0340, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email jd52g@nih.gov - Pamela Lew, Chief, HLV Section, Phone (301) 435-0340, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email pl116x@nih.gov
<DESC>The Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) contractors will design and conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of around-the-clock, supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and moderately severe hypoxemia. This trial is needed to provide a scientific basis for decisions regarding the clinical use of long-term oxygen treatment. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve clinical management of COPD, with increased length and quality of life for patients with COPD.  
The LOTT will consist of one DCC and approximately 20 regional clinical centers (RCCs). The RCCs will be awarded under RFP NHLBI-HR-06-07 and the DCC will be awarded under RFP NHLBI-HR-06-08. The LOTT will test the efficacy of supplemental oxygen treatment in subjects with COPD, moderately severe hypoxemia, and other risk factors for premature death such as severe dyspnea, exercise limitation, low body mass, or frequent exacerbations. The trial will be designed to detect a difference in mortality between two groups randomized to receive long-term oxygen treatment or usual care with periodic monitoring of hypoxemic status. The trial will also test for possible differences in quality of life.  Contractors will design and carry out the clinical trial, monitor and report adverse events, analyze the study data, submit results of the study and substudies for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and engage in other dissemination activities. Each RCC will organize and manage a network of cooperating sites (such as hospitals, clinics, pulmonary rehabilitation centers, and physician offices) to assist in subject enrollment, characterization, and follow up. It is expected that a total of approximately 5000 subjects will be enrolled over a 3 - 3½ year period and that subjects will be followed for an additional year after the end of the enrollment period.   The trial will be conducted in three phases.  During Phase I (6 months) investigators will meet to develop the Protocol(s), model informed consent document(s), Manual of Operations, and study forms. The Steering Committee will develop procedures and tools for training of staff, randomization of subjects, data management, and quality assurance/quality control of study activities and data. Staff will assist the DCC in the development of study forms. During Phase II (4 years 6 months) staff will be trained, subjects screening and recruited, interventions, and follow-up will be performed at the RCCs and data collection and monitoring will occur at the DCC.  During Phase III investigators will engage in dissemination activities which include data analysis and reporting.  This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFPs will be available on or about November 8, 2005 at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-06-10627 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-12.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 339111?Laboratory Apparatus and Furniture Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500.  A firm fixed contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  The competition method used for this procurement is full and open.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requests quotes on continuous monitors for the measurement of PM 2.5 and PM 10-2.5.  The offeror may quote on one or more monitor models based on different monitoring technologies.  The offeror shall provide separate quotes on each of the different PM continuous monitoring technology proposed.  Each quote shall include the cost of shipping, a one-day on-site visit with training, and turn key operation of each unit.  Each monitor shall be delivered with an electronic copy of the user manual.  The quote shall include the cost of a shelter if the monitor is required to be operated in a stand  alone shelter.  Units that can be operated in standard ambient air monitoring stations need not include the cost of a separate shelter. EPA intends, pending availability and cost, to select two or four different monitoring technologies.  This could result in awards to multiple vendors with a total purchase of 6-12 monitors. Mandatory performance specifications are as follows: 1) The PM continuous monitor model shall be commercially available or a next generation version of a model that has been sold commercially or has otherwise been subject to field testing under conditions similar to those at State/local air monitoring stations.  2)  The PM continuous monitor shall be  capable of operation in a standard ambient monitoring sampling trailer or stand alone shelter.  3)  The PM continuous monitoring shall provide for hourly time resolution or better.  4)  The continuous monitor shall provide for PM size separation resulting in measurement of at least PM10-2.5.  Measurement of PM2.5 is desirable, but not required. 5)  The PM continuous monitor shall be capable of electronic data capture and reporting via RS 232 or Ethernet.  6)  The PM continuous monitor shall be capable of automated operation for up to 2 weeks without on-site technician support needed.  7)	The PM continuous monitor shall have the capability of conditioning the sample stream so that the effect of moisture on the collected sample is minimized.  This can be either operator selectable or dependent on the conditions of the sample stream.  8)	The continuous monitor shall be capable of reporting concentrations based on actual temperature and barometric pressure.  Please submit two copies of your proposal.  The Government will make an award to the responsible offer whose proposal offers the "Best Value" to the Government price and other factors considered.  All offerors are to include with their offers a completed copy of provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items.  The completed Representations and Certifications should be included with the proposal.  The evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: (i) Technical Capability  The vendor shall demonstrate proven reliability of their technology.  This ranking factor will be evaluated based on the available peer reviewed literature, and references from  State, local or other monitoring agencies on use of existing generation technologies. Vendors are encouraged to supply a list of references.  (ii) Past Performance:  The offeror quote shall include field data or indicate data available from an EPA study, State and local agency, scientific paper, or other entity.  The data will be used to consider the performance of the technology.  Evaluation of the vendor?s field data will be based on comparison to low-volume filter based FRM?s or other sampling methodologies such as the samplers used in chemical speciation monitoring sites that are part of the IMPROVE or speciation networks.  Data algorithms can be sued in the monitors to demonstrate performance so long as they were consistently applied for all test sites, even if these algorithms are for post processing of data and were not part of the firmware of the instrument.  Performance of the monitoring technology will be based on meeting proposed PM 10-2.5 and PM 2.5 class II equivalent method criteria for precision, correlation, additive bias, and multiplicative bias.  These proposed criteria are available on the web at:  http://www.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/files/ambient/m25/frnoticejan2006.  See table C-4 to subpart C of Part 58.  Not meeting one or more performance criteria would not immediately disqualify a technology so long as the vendor can identify how it has  improved the performance of the instrument through engineering of software modifications.  Instruments meeting the desired performance criteria ? with or without statistical corrections ? will be rated higher than those that do not.  ((iii) Price.   The following FAR referenced clauses apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items.  The following additional FAR clauses which are cited in clauses 52.212-5 are applicable to this acquisition: 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; 52.222-36, Affirmative  Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era.  Please submit two copies of the proposal to Natalia Fisher-Jackson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (D143-01), 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a non-competitive, sole source basis purchase to Varian, Inc. 2700 Mitchell Drive, Walnut Creek, CA  94598.  FDA intends to purchase part number 0392760392, MS/MS upgrade, 1500 Dalton, Field Kit, for 1200L  single to triple quad.  Varian shall install the instrument.  Varian, Inc is the sole manufacturer of the MS/MS upgrade kit for the Varian 1200 L GC-MS system currently owned by the Agency.  No other known company makes an upgrade to allow a single quadropole instrument to be converted to a triple quadropole GC-MS instrument.  This upgrade will provide FDA scientists an additional tool for identification and confirmation of unknown analytes related to both food defense and food safety.  The addition of the GC/MS/MS upgrade to current FDA instrumentation would increase the laboratory capabilities available for this and other projects at a much lower cost than purchasing a new GC/MS/MS system.  This upgrade will not only provide GC/MS/MS analysis but would afford a future upgrade to a LC/MS/MS system with minimal additional funding.  FDA intends to make an award fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the Government.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.  An award will be made immediately after the response date of this notice.  The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable item is Stockert S3 Heart Lung Perfusion System. NAICS Code 339112, size standard for Small Business reporting purposes is 500 employees.

Sorin Group Company is the sole US manufacturer of the Stockert S3 Heart Lung Perfusion System. The make and model of this device is the specific device that is technically acceptable in providing life-saving cardiopulmonary measures during critical open-heart surgery.  It is a requirement of Naval Medical Center San Diego’s perfusion contract that all perfusionists (operator of heart lung machine) have documentation of 200 cases performed with this particular model.  This machine is the surgical patient’s life support and is the documented standard of care model.  NMCSD owns one Stockert S3 model (bought in 2003) and one Stockert CAPS model and is replacing the CAPS model as it has passed its life-expectancy and must be replaced by Dec 2006.  The result will be two S3 machines in the same operatory. The S-3 model familiarity allows for smooth operation of two surgical cases simultaneously in the same operatory.

The Stockert S3 Heart Lung Perfusion System must be a complete system, including SIII Consoles (Includes UPS), SIII Pump Modules, Vairolock Tubing Gate and Accessories, SIII Control Desk (includes Mounting Arm), SIII Control Devices and Monitors, SIII Accessories - Masts and Crosstrays, SIII Miscellaneous products (3:1 Reduction for SIII pump, LED Lamp 24 V, & SIII connection module 24V/CAN-EXT2.), Service Manual, Tubing Inserts for Bubble Sensor, and SCP Stockert Centrifugal Pump.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a  Small Business Size Standard of 100 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability, to include proof of distributorship of specified brand name only item(s) in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 7 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Richard Taylor at rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Capability statements are due by 1600 (4:00 PM) Eastern Time 21 AUG 2006.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice for the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) Individual High Explosive Air Bursting (HEAB) Weapon System Technology Development Project Solicitation No. W15QKN-06-R-1410 The U.S. Army ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the  Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM-SW),  intends to award a sole source  contract to Alliant Techsystems Integrated (ATK) for the OICW PDRR program,  Individual HEAB Weapon System Technology Development (TD) Project.   The TD Project will design and develop an airbursting individual weapon system to meet user identified capability gaps for revolutionary lethality, while  extending stand-off range; defeating defilade targets, providing day, night  and all weather capability; and incorporating a multifunctional fire control  sub-system. The four overall objectives of the TD phase will be  first, to continue design  of the Target Acquisition/Fire Control system; second, continue design of the  25mm airburst delivery platform; third, design the family of ammunition (Air  burst, Anti Personnel, Armor Piercing); and fourth, continue integration of   the subsystems.  To achieve these objectives it may be necessary to build,  integrate and test full-up systems. The contractor must also provide system  engineering, design engineering, materials, services, testing, technical  management, quality assurance, equipment, facilities, prototyping, and  administration, as applicable.  These efforts will continue the development an  individual HEAB weapon system that meets the system performance requirements. The Government will employ Acquisition Reform principles, including Integrated  Product Teams (IPT's), Simulation and Modeling, Cost as an Independent  Variable (CAIV), Integrated Data Environment (IDE), Clear Accountability in  Design, Earned Value Management (EVM)(modified reporting requirements contractor format acceptable), and Open Systems to balance cost, schedule, and  performance risks for the TD Phase.  The contractor will be responsible to  organize, coordinate, and control program activities to comply with contract  requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services.  The contractor shall also monitor the progress of work performed and costs  incurred under the contract.  The contractor shall prepare progress, status,  and management reports.  The contractor will develop and maintain an  Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) with no restrictions. At the conclusion of the TD effort, the contractor shall document and deliver  an updated system performance specification of the Individual HEAB Weapon  System, reflecting the performance levels validated through use of contractor  tests and Government technical tests (when applicable).   The contractor shall  also document and deliver draft performance specifications of the subsystem  level requirements. The contract effort will consist of a base effort plus eight discretionary  phases of development; Insensitive Munitions (IM) Baseline Test, Family of  Ammunition Concepts, Hardware for Government Testing, Hardware for User  Evaluation, Contractor Support to Government Tests and Demonstrations, Target  Acquisition/Fire Control for the FFW, Long Lead Items and Technical Data  Package.  The Government will reserve the unilateral right to fund or forego  these phases based on technical requirements and/or availability of funds.   A  Sole Source Request for Proposal (RFP) to be posted on the TACOM-ARDEC  Acquisition Center website located at: http://procnet.pica.army.mil  is  planned for release on or about 31 August 2006.  The point of contact for this  requirement is David DeCandia, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-AQ-APD, BLDG 10,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: decandia@pica.army.mil, telephone  number: 973-724-4674.

<RESPDATE>092806
<ARCHDATE>11272006
<CONTACT>Beth Chapman, 757-878-0009
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, AP-BLU/Clean Light-weight Area Weapon (CLAW).  The Armys overarching requirement is to conduct a concept demonstration/evaluation of wide area Anti-Personnel/Anti-Material air-to-ground Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) munitions capability on a Hunter UAV.  The acquisition builds upon previously completed contracted research and development as well as independent research and development conducted b y Textron Systems.  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to Textron Systems, who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement.  The maximum v alue of the contract will be $9.9 million.  The contract minimum value of $2.4 million will be met with award of the first cost-plus-fixed-fee task order.  The funding for this requirement results from a Congressional earmark for weapons capability modific ations UAV Alternate Payload Munition (AP-BLU) associated, based on market research, with Textron Systems. This requirement is for the testing of UAV dispensed, gravity dropped area weapon that leaves no unexploded ordinance on the battlefield.  Accordingl y, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified Textron as the o nly source developing UAV dispensed, gravity dropped area weapons technology which 1) Is light enough for incorporation on both the Hunter and Extended Range, Multipurpose (ERMP) UAVs; 2) Is ready for incorporation onto the designated UAVs without two to t hree years of further development as well as expense beyond the quantity and scope identified in the current Congressional marks; 3) Is sufficiently developed to conduct meaningful concept evaluation at this point; 4) Is sufficiently developed in order to leverage the joint testing opportunities;  5) Provides battlefield operations feature with multiple redundant safety features, preventing contamination of target or other areas with unexploded munitions; 6)  Is sufficiently lethal to destroy a large number  and variety of unprotected and lightly protected targets within a substantial radius with blast, shrapnel and incendiary effects; 7) Is compatible with the Universal Aerial Delivery Dispenser (U-ADD) for precision delivery within the target area to minimi ze the potential for fratricide and/or collateral damage; and 8) Is, to the maximum practical extent, based upon non-developmental, fielded or inventoried hardware to minimize production, fielding and support costs.  The Government deems that substantial d uplication of cost incurred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source has the equivalent technical maturity to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe for which Congressionally earma rked funds were provided.  Many of the concepts to be further explored under the planned efforts are either patented or proprietary to Textron Systems.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Textron Syste ms.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and Textron Systems, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).   The overall period of performance fo r the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 and the size standard is 1,000.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a prop osal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Ceseley Dunbar), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Dunbars phone number is 757-878-2771.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address (Datafax 757-878-0008) or email address cdunbar@aatd.eustis.army.mil.

<DESC>The US Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to acquire services to collect data on the occurrence of right whales in nearshore continental shelf waters of the United States Mid-Atlantic coast.  The primary goal of this work is to identify migratory habitats and potential wintering ground for the right whale.  Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  The Agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  In the Mid-Atlantic States between North Carolina and New Jersey, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) share responsibility for overseeing and partially funding research on marine mammals, notably those populations listed as Strategic Stocks.  The population of right whales in the Western North Atlantic is highly endangered.

The Contractor shall provide all items necessary to perform the services described herein, which shall include but are not limited to: office facilities, supplies, equipment, hardware, software, and professional expertise, travel expenses, etc.

<DESC>--This notice has been modified due to a date change.--

The Government Printing Office (GPO) intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB).  The GPO is seeking a contractor to assist FRTIB staff in conducting (development, delivery, and analysis of) a survey of Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) participants.  The GPO is requesting a bid for services on a single survey only; however, this initial survey will serve as the basis for a longitudinal survey process, with additional surveys to be conducted at regular intervals in the future.  In consultation with the FRTIB, the contractor must be able to perform the following tasks: determine appropriate survey methodology, identify appropriate sample populations, develop survey questions, pretest and conduct the survey, tabulate the survey results, analyze the statistical data, produce a written report of survey results and provide raw data to the Agency in an electronic format.  The contractor should have extensive experience conducting surveys of participants in employee benefit plans.

It is contemplated that a fixed-price contract will be awarded for this effort.  Estimated release date for the solicitation is on or about June 13, 2006.  GPO seeks to have the survey process completed and final report delivered no later October 31, 2006.  

Electronic copies of the RFP and any other documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.

<DESC>This modification is issued to add previously omitted Evaluation Factor #4. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number DG133C-06-RQ-0827 is issued as a request for quotation. This announcement is a re-issuance of a previous solicitation, Solicitation Number NCNR0000-6-00021. The primary North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) has a requirement for Environmental Consulting Services in support of a coral reef restoration project in Vieques, Puerto Rico.  The goals of this requirement are to test various materials and artificial reef structural designs to determine whether certain materials and forms are preferable to others in terms of the success of coral settlement and growth and the survival of corals transplanted to these structures, and to determine which structural forms are preferable in terms of habitat for other benthic and mobile reef organisms.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) compare different materials such as cement, ceramic, and coral rock to examine differences between coral settlement and growth and coral transplant survival; 2) compare different artificial reef structures with varying shapes and forms to determine the  influence of structure on coral reef settlement, growth, and transplant success, settlement and growth of other sessile marine organisms, and use by mobile reef organisms; and 3) produce a report containing findings and recommendations regarding the use of artificial structures to rebuild damaged coral reefs in terms of both materials and forms.  NOAA requires information regarding settlement and transplant success of the staghorn (Acropora cervicornis) and elkhorn (A. palmata) coral species on artificial  structures in order to determine whether potential impacts from cleanup activities can be mitigated for these two threatened species using artificial reef structures in areas where spawning populations and sources of transplants of these species are present. NOAA shall use artificial reef structures in coral restoration off Vieques Island and requires the testing of various materials and artificial reef structural designs to determine which structural forms are preferable in terms of habitat. A combination of structural forms and materials shall be proposed to create a minimum of three different artificial reef structures.  Each of the three structures shall be used to test coral settlement and settlement of other sessile benthic organisms to artificial reef structures with and without coral transplants. A minimum of two replicates of each structure is requested, which will result in a minimum of twelve total structures. The project shall take place off Blue Beach in Vieques, Puerto Rico. The period of performance shall be from the date of award through twenty-four (24) months. The Government estimates that approximately $75,000.00 will be required for this  work. The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm fixed price. The award shall be made on a best value basis. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Approach – The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance – The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price – The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price; 4) Small Business Status - Based on the applicable NAICS Code(541620), small businesses will be rated Good; other businesses will be rated Adequate. The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Outstanding (O) – Conspicuously striking in eminence; Good (G) – Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Adequate (A) – Reasonably sufficient and suitable; Marginal (M) – Minimally suitable at the lower limit. The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-09. The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.arnet.gov.far. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items.

<DESC>The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB, FL BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR TACTICAL CAPABILITIES FOR BATTLEFIELD AIRMAN AND SECURITY FORCE, MNK-BAA-06-0003 is hereby amended.  The following information is provided to expand the research area of Tactical Electrical Energy to include Personnel Protection Gear of the Occupants: 

Tactical Electrical Energy

The goal of this work is to perform component and vehicle research in the areas of:  advanced battery development, power management, and integrated vehicle design and body armor.  The objective is to develop highly mobile, quiet, lightweight, electrical vehicles for SOF, Security Forces, and Battlefield Airman personnel.  This work also includes the analysis, design, and assessment of electrical power systems for their use at deployed or remote locations.  The capability of deploying and moving electrical power on the battlefield is mission essential.  This research on mobile, electrical power should also be considered for use with other government agencies and organizations.  The efforts described may require individual component level development as well as fabrication to develop a mobile power capability.

“Personnel Protection Gear”

In support of the original goal of MNK-BAA-06-0003, it is also intended research should include the armor worn by the vehicle occupants.  Weight is a key factor in delivering capabilities to the battlefield, which includes the combined weight of the vehicle, supplies, and troops.  The design should take into account the ability to interchange vehicle body armor for personnel armor and visa verse.  The solution should be an integrated design.  Therefore, the objective is to include not only vehicle armor, but the armor carried by the troops and the design and fabric of the protective clothing that could incorporate the interchangeable armor.  There is also an objective to incorporate low power electrical sensors, devices, etc. into the fabric and armor plating to provide commander’s with tactical C4ISR information about power management and system health status.  Care and design considerations should be taken with respect to tactical vehicles used by SOF troops.  New or modified equipment (material) should not inadvertently ground the vehicle or generate electrical interferences.

<SUBJECT>A -- Semantic Interoperability
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-06-08-IFKA

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to update the funding opportunity description, including revisions to: (a) technical focus area for the submission of white papers in FY07, and (b) white paper submission instructions.  This modification also adds Ombusman information.  All other information remains the same.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOCUS AREA DESCRIPTION: 

Semantic interoperability is becoming an increasingly important problem as user communities seek to interoperate within and between information spaces such as those that ride on the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Semantic interoperability can be defined as the ability of two (or more) systems (services) to exchange data on the basis of an agreed vocabulary (ontology) that guarantees the same interpretation (semantics or meaning) of notions (concepts and their interrelationships) for the users of the interoperating systems.  An ontology can be defined as a specific vocabulary and relationships between terms (words) used to describe certain aspects of reality, and a set of explicit assumptions regarding the intended meaning of the terms and relationships of the vocabulary.  Ontologies are often viewed as allowing more complete and precise domain models, and the support and use of multiple, independently-developed ontologies is important to support multiple Communities of Interest (COIs), information producers, and information consumers.  Information transformation can be defined as a facet of information management that involves the processing of elementary forms of information into rich interoperable decision making knowledge structures for human, enterprise, and machine learning and growth.  Semantic interoperability is considered an important foundation for increasingly effective information management and transformation capabilities that accommodate cross-domain information sharing and understanding.  Semantically-aware information management services are needed to support information sharing between producers and consumers of information who belong to different COIs which prescribe to different ontologies.

FY07:  Ontological Interoperability.  Important to information transformation is gaining an understanding of the context of an information request (e.g., so that an information system can distinguish between whether the term "Predator" refers to an unmanned aerial vehicle, an animal, or a movie).  A context contains metadata relating to its meaning, properties (such as its source, quality, and precision), and organization.  Modeling and representing context can lead to several benefits in dealing with information overload by transforming information from its source context into the context of another user or system domain.  This in turn promotes interoperability at the semantic level.  Several approaches for representing context can be found in the literature.  One suggests bringing together metadata, user profiles, information modeling abstractions, and ontologies to construct a model of the application domain and user needs.(1)  Another proposes emergent semantics where the meaning of information is extracted from the manner in which they are used.(2)  Many suggest using agent technology to gather context information and negotiate contexts(3), as well as rule-based(4), classification-based(5), pattern-based(6) and heuristics-based(7) methods to perform context characterization that would enable mediation between contexts.  The primary goal is not to develop new reasoning methods and techniques, but rather to apply known approaches from the fields of knowledge representation and reasoning to provide context modeling and transformation solutions.  In FY07, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for achieving ontological mediation between different domains, vocabularies, information sources, and services.  Capabilities of particular interest include ontological interoperability technologies which contribute to our ability to: (a) provide a coordinated view across multiple data sources and knowledge representations, (b) mediate over mappings between multiple data sources and formats into a format conducive to knowledge-based analytical tools and intelligence analysts, (c) consolidate, disambiguate and normalize multi-source data into concrete knowledge representations, and (d) exchange and reuse inference-capable knowledge representations across differing contexts.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Do not submit a formal proposal at this time. Offerors are required to submit a white paper no longer than seven (7) pages in length. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white paper/proposal, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an email address with their submission. 

All responses to this announcement should be electronically mailed to James.Milligan@rl.af.mil and reference BAA-06-08-IFKA in the subject line. To be considered for potential awards in FY07, white papers must be received before the end of 15 Sep 2006. 

Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA.  The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:

	Amy Smith
	AFRL/PK

	1864 Fourth Street
	Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7132

Introduction: The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced technology development in Digital Data Embedding Technologies (DDET): information hiding, steganography, watermarking, steganalysis, embedded data extraction, digital data forensics, etc. Information hiding and data embedding refer to secure addition of information content to digital data products using mathematical techniques which work at the constructive level of the product. Steganography refers to the use of data embedding for covert communication. Watermarking refers to embedding additional information about the cover data. Steganalysis detects the presence of steganographic communications. Embedded data extraction refers to the extrication of hidden information. Digital data forensics refers to analysis that gathers evidence of data composition, origin, pedigree, etc. Techniques applicable to all types of digital data are of interest. This program will develop, employ and exploit digital data embedding technologies to provide early demonstrations for potential applications to operational DoD systems. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a vehicle for continued development over its duration. Objective: DDET technologies have shown great potential to contribute to the defense information architecture in the areas of information assurance, authentication, augmentation, and protection. This procurement will assist the government in the technical development of DDET technologies, for evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies, and in prototype demonstrations of these technologies into appropriate systems. Technical Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Multi-Sensor Exploitation Branch has fostered DDET research & development for the past several years. For the most part, this has been done with small university grants, small business and dual use contracts, etc. The results have been widely briefed, well-received, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information technologies. Selected advances have begun transition to prototypes, to the extent made possible by funding. It is believed that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated future research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid DDET technology insertion.  Innovative DDET Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative DDET research and development.  

Awards: Multiple awards for the DDET White Paper initiative are anticipated. The principal funding and the anticipated awards as a result of this PRDA will start in 4Q FY02, and will be in the form of contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed. Contractor teaming is encouraged. Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $25,000 to $1,000,000 for basic research and prototype development, and $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts. AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA. Deliverables will be technical reports, prototype applications, software and integrated system enhancements and upgrades.  

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness. In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort. Experience with, and access to, DDET migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work. Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary; however, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the DDET PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Chad Heitzenrater, Ref. PRDA 02-08-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 02-08-IFKA.  

It is recommended that white papers be received by the following date to maximize the possibility of award:  FY07 - 28 Feb 2007.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each fiscal year after the dates cited.   The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award. White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

The total value for all awards under this PRDA shall not exceed $24,000,000. 

Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level is excluded.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  

This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2007.  A copy of the AFRL/IFK publication, "BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry", Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. 

In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA.  The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:

<DESC>PURPOSE:  THIS MODIFICATION IS BEING ISSUED TO CLARIFY THE SOLICITATION NUMBER.  THE PROPER NUMBER IS WC133F06RP0187JAA.

The US Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to acquire services to collect data on the occurrence of right whales in nearshore continental shelf waters of the United States Mid-Atlantic coast.  The primary goal of this work is to identify migratory habitats and potential wintering ground for the right whale.  Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  The Agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  In the Mid-Atlantic States between North Carolina and New Jersey, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) share responsibility for overseeing and partially funding research on marine mammals, notably those populations listed as Strategic Stocks.  The population of right whales in the Western North Atlantic is highly endangered.  

The services under this contract are to be provided for the SEFSC in Miami, Florida.  The services include, but are not limited to:  1) Collection of data, utilizing aerial survey methods, of Northern right whales between North Carolina and Maryland. (As is possible, collect photographs for use in photo-identification of observed whales.); 2) Report positions of observed right whales to appropriate agencies (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, NEFSC Sightings Advisory System) to allow the broad cast of positions to mariners and thereby mitigate vessel strikes; and 3) Recommend to the Government, actions and activities to improve information on right whale habitat use in these areas and further mitigate collisions with vessels.

The Contractor shall provide all items necessary to perform the services described herein, which shall include but are not limited to: office facilities, supplies, equipment, hardware, software, and professional expertise, travel expenses, etc.

The period of performance will be October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government.  This acquisition is not set-aside for small business.  The NAICS code is 541990.   All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  For instructions on how to register in CCR and ORCA please access the following web site: http://www.bpn.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.  A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at 800-333-0505. 

Firms interested in receiving notification when the Request For Proposal is available must submit a request in writing to the attention of Jane A. Allen via e-mail at jane.a.allen@noaa.gov or facsimile at 816-274-6936.   Reference must be made to the RFP number WC133F06RP0187JAA.   Requests must include company name; address; CAGE number, DUNS number, phone number; fax number, and e-mail address.   NO PHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. All sources submitting a written request for the solicitation will be notified via e-mail when the solicitation documents are available along with instructions on how to obtain them.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the agency.

Description

The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is seeking information from sources that can provide a small, portable Electrical Power Source for the Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) mission to eliminate dependence on avionic frequency converters and aircraft power systems.  The preferred sources include rechargeable batteries, fuel cells or any other sources that do not emit dangerous exhaust products.

The electrical power source should have as a minimum the following capabilities:

1. 	The volume of the electrical power source must enable the device to fit on the Air Force’s Patient Support Pallet with the patients.  Free space is at a premium.    

2.	The product’s overall weight should be minimized.  Responders should specify whether their device provides power to each individual patient or can serve multiple patients simultaneously. 

3.	   Power (per patient):  300 W continuous, 400W peak (several seconds).  Electrical power should be renewable either by the addition of new fuel or by recharging.

4.	Energy (per patient):  3600 W·hr total capacity (for a 12-hour mission).  This may be distributed over multiple fuel cartridges/battery packs/other energy sources.

5.	Energy density: Greater than 150 W·hr/kg for entire system (i.e. unit plus fuel/batteries) for a 12-hour (3600 W·hr) mission

6.	Provide both 12 VDC and 120 VAC @ 60 Hz via high-efficiency DC-AC converter (> 85%).  Provide output connectors that support a current load of up to 7.5 A.  Provide a design for single or multiple patients with connections to power up to 6 devices per patient.

7.	The electrical power source will operate in an atmosphere where there may be jet fuel vapor present.  The product must not spark for any reason and must not use high volumes of potentially explosive fuel.

8.	If power system emits exhaust products other than water, must demonstrate its safety for use in aircraft cargo bays.

9.	It is desired that the technology be ready for production within one year.

10.  	The electrical power source will operate in aircraft at altitude. During an in-flight rapid decompression the expansion in air volume will not diminish the electrical generation capacity of the product. The product should be able to work in a high altitude chamber to 15,000 feet above sea level. The product should be able to undergo a rapid decompression to 45,000 feet above sea level.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_500.4 ).

11.   	The product will withstand exposure to humidity levels from 5% to 95%.

12.  	The product shall be able to recover after being subjected to high temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 501.4.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_501.4 ).

13. 	The product shall be able to recover after being subjected to low temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 502.4.  (See URL: http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_502.4 ).

14.	The product shall meet all applicable OSHA standards for safety and EPA standards for disposal.

<DESC>Description:  The U.S. Army Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office is seeking sources with innovative approaches, designs, or products for a Modernized Dayside Sensor Assembly (MDSA) on the AH-64A and AH-64D Apache helicopter.  The AH-64 is the U.S.  Army's primary attack helicopter and is designed to fight during the day, night, and in adverse weather.  The AH-64 can be armed with 16 HELLFIRE missiles, a 30mm M230 chain gun, and/or 76 2.75 inch folding fin rockets.  The U.S. Army has recently complet ed development of the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight (MTADS) and the Modernized Pilot Night Vision System (MPNVS).  The MDSA will complement and extend the capabilities of the MTADS/MPNVS as well as reduce the logistical burden, operations  and sustainment costs, eliminate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability over the current dayside sensor. REQUIREMENTS:  The modernized dayside sensor must have an open-systems architecture, fit within the volume of the currently existing dayside (approximately 19 inches in diameter and 11.5 inches in height), and be compatible/interoperable with the MTADS/MPN VS/AH-64(A&D).   Capabilities desired include multimode laser rangefinder/designators, mid-wave infrared sensors, color television sensors, image intensification sensors, laser pointers, other sensor technologies, and inertial measurement units.  Already p roven packages are preferred that will support a two level maintenance concept.  The design must not interfere with the aircraft safety or adversely affect aircraft weight and balance limitations.   The U.S. Army seeks qualified vendors to provide conceptual papers, design information, technology availability, maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions, support requirements, reliability data including Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) data  addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  Innovative ideas and solutions are strongly encouraged especially regarding testing and use of modeling and simulation during system development.    All interested qualified sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest and qualifications to the Contracting Officer, Cheryl Moore-Davis, (256) 313-4133, e-mail address is Cheryl.Davis@us.army.mil.  The submission of this informat ion is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>71 -- Furniture Lease
<DESC>This is a special notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order for a lease of computer workstations with Elite Installation Services  under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the reasons stated in the following justification.


5.	  DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AUTHORITY:
Reprocuring furniture to replace the existing furniture with a contractor other than Elite Services, Inc. will 
Have a disruptive impact to USSOCOM’s mission because:

1.	Over 200 occupants will need to be displaced to remove the communication lines, power lines and workstations owned by Elite Services Inc.  Furthermore, the occupants will remain displaced until the new workstations are installed and wired for communication and power.
2.	USSOCOM does not have any space to house 200 displaced personnel or any fraction thereof for any duration.
3.	USSOCOM does not have funding to hire a contractor to remove and reinstall the communication and power lines.  
4.	USSOCOM has already spent $37,000 on communications infrastructure and the instillation of the furniture.  These costs would be duplicated should a source other than Elite Services be utilized for this requirement.


Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Performance shall be here at  Macdill AFB, FL. NAICS Code is 532420 and small business size standard is $23 million. The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11, applicable FAR and DFARS clauses are 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52-232-33, 252,212-7000, and 252.212-7001, 5352.9103 and provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423430 with a small business size standar d of 500 employees.  DELL Brand Name items are required by 1st IO CMD for lifecycle replacement of desktop workstations.  The 1st IO CMD established a baseline initiative using DELL products on its Command and Control networks.  The management of such base line ensures the security of the network through patch management and IAVA implementation.  Because administration is conducted using the SMS management tool, multiple baselines can not efficiently be managed while maintaining the required security measure s necessary to protect Command and Control information.

NOTE: IF THIS RFQ IS BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (SEE Bidding Instructions): Offerors quoting the brand name product that are not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor of the brand name product MUST submit a signed letter from the manufacturer of the brand name product stating the following:   "Manufacturer, has agreed to supply brand name product to Your company for the purpose of providing the supplies to the DoS." FOB DESTINAION CONUS Offerors quoting the brand name product that are not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor of the brand name product MUST submit a signed letter from the manufacturer of the brand name product stating the following: "Manufacturer, has agreed to supply brand name product to Your company for the purpose of providing the supplies to the DoS "Manufacturer, has agreed to supply brand name product to Your company for the purpose of providing the supplies to the DoS." It is required that the Sig Sauer P229 Pistol be purchased to issue to the agents who will be assigned to overseas Posts.  The above weapons will be used to replace the Department of State weapons destroyed in accordance with the Federal Property Management regulation.  This will enable the agents to provide continued protection and security for personnel. Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while traveling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability. Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is the issued pistol that all agents are trained on.  Overall length: 7.1 inches, Overall height: 5.4 inches, Overall width: 1.5 inches, Barrel length: 3.9 inches, Weight w/o mag: 28.1 oz, Mag weight: 3.0 oz, Sight radius: 5.7 inches.  State Department requires the Law Enforcement magazine which holds 13 rounds as opposed to 10 rounds and DS also requires the Trijicon night sights.   Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include the protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the weapons requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.  The Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is a unique system that our armorers have been certified to repair, and that the agents have been trained to use.  All agents must be able to pick up a weapon and use it, not just the one they were trained on, and this becomes a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons. The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  Sig Sauer is the manufacturer of the P229 Pistol. The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board (FPRB) has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS Agents.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Architect-Engineering Services (A&E Services) are required for pre-planning services and the resultant design of facility improvements and enhancements at Plum Island, NY, Animal Disease Center (PIADC).  It is the intention of the Government to award the pre-planning and the design services to the same A&E firm.  The contract will contain options for additional services to include Construction Administration and Commissioning Services.  It is anticipated that a construction contract will be awarded soon after design begins.

Plum Island is a federally owned 840-acre island off the northeastern tip of Long Island, New York.  The island is approximately 1.5 miles from Orient Point, New York, and approximately 12 miles from New London, Connecticut, accessible only by limited ferry service for research facility employees and approved visitors.  PIADC is a unique critical national asset for Agro-defense and the only facility in the United States permitted to handle Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) live virus.  The facility is approximately 50 years old and is clearly beyond its design life.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate, Office of National Laboratories (ONL) was charged with assessing the facility and the identification of necessary facility upgrades to extend its lifetime over the next ten years to support the foreseeable combined DHS/USDA mission.

The proposed improvements and enhancements at PIADC facility will address necessary corrective actions to the facility, assure the continuation of existing research, and satisfy increased mission responsibilities for Agro-defense of DHS and USDA. 

The overall A&E services required shall include a combination of new construction, renovation of existing facilities, and the design, staging, commissioning and overall integration of all facilities within the unique constraints of performing work at PIADC.  As an island and a secure DHS property, it is critical that the selected A&E Services firm be able to adequately address the development of design documents and estimates that are cognizant of challenging logistics and coordination with ongoing operations.  Each of the improvements and enhancements identified below will require various levels of integration with actively utilized existing animal holding facilities and research laboratories, as well as with current facility operation control systems.  The A&E Services firm will be required to design these facilities and renovations in conformance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, guidelines and codes and obtain all necessary permits or revisions to existing permits upon commissioning of all facilities.  In addition, the latest available best practices and design standards for USDA (USDA ARS Facilities Design Standards 242.1M-ARS available on the USDA web site) and AALAC shall be utilized.  The specific improvements and enhancements to be incorporated in the design may include:

•	Construct New Animal Wing, consisting of 8,000 net square feet of new BSL-3Ag animal holding capacity with various room sizes and configurations meeting AALAC standards.  A batch wastewater sterilization treatment system to handle bio-containment liquid effluent isolated to the new wing would also be required.
•	Upgrade Chiller Plant – Provide additional chiller with sufficient capacity to service all new construction and interior facility upgrades; replace and upgrade the chilled water transmission line leading to Building 101.
•	Expand and Upgrade the East and Orient Wing Necropsy Rooms– Construct new necropsy capability dedicated to research functions servicing the new animal holding wing.  The existing necropsy will be improved and expanded to handle state-of-the-art distance learning equipment, hands-on facilities for veterinary training and sufficient decontamination facilities to support training classes.  Retrofit incinerator intake areas will also be required to accommodate necropsy expansion.  Project staging and coordination will be required to maintain necropsy and crematory capabilities through all aspects of construction.
•	Convert the East Service Wing Storage Area to BSL-3+ Laboratory Space – Convert 2500 sq. ft. of existing storage space within BSL containment area to laboratory space for DHS research programs.  Project staging and coordination will be required to maintain building services access and to facilitate portions of this design area to be temporarily taken out of containment for construction activities.
•	Power Distribution/UPS—For the main laboratory (Bldg 101), develop a critical and non-critical electrical load distribution plan and implement by redistributing power and replacing old and/or obsolete equipment; provide reliable power to the critical loads via a battery back up Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) System using 480 volt static switching technology.  Aspects of this project will be performed within BSL-3+ containment facilities and other aspects will include the new construction laboratory projects as defined herein.
•	Bldg. 102 Waste Water Decontamination Upgrades—Provide necessary process upgrades (isolated tank, pump, piping replacements) to the laboratory wastewater decontamination system.  Provide a new wastewater transmission line from Building 101 to Building 102.  Perform necessary structural repairs, roofing and finishes to ensure the facility meets necessary bio-containment standards.
•	Upgrade Water Supply System—Provide evaluation of known issues, replacement of antiquated distribution system piping and upgrade of treatment systems related to the domestic water supply system, water purification system and fire suppression system.
•	Perform an Environmental Assessment – A new Environmental Assessment will be developed prior to the construction and improvements at PIADC to comply with NEPA requirements and DHS policy.  The Environmental Assessment shall incorporate potential impacts from all projects listed herein.
•	Firehouse/Motor Pool – Construct new firehouse/motor pool building to replace the antiquated and inadequate structures and to consolidate within the active area of the island the Firehouse, Motor Pool, and Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  

This acquisition is a total Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 54310, with a Size Standard of $4.5 million.  This is a Request for Qualifications of Small Business A&E firms interested in contracting for this work.  A&E firm, as used in this synopsis, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project pre-design services and design documents.  The scope of the A&E services required under this proposed contract includes, but is not limited to, the following:  Perform pre-design services, including the preparation of a planning document/feasibility study to include the basic requirements and information needed to procure, plan, design and perform the construction required for the Integrated Facility Improvements at PIADC; Prepare design documents for the facility through concepts, design development and construction documentation.  The Estimated Cost of Construction (ECC) will be between $22 and $30 million.

The purpose of this procurement is to select a highly qualified A&E Services firm with demonstrated expertise in the design of Bio-Safety Level 3, 3 Enhanced, and 3 Ag laboratories, large ungulate animal vivariums, necropsies, or similar facilities.   This contract will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.  The A&E Services firm will be selected in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this synopsis, the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, through review of Standard Form (SF) 330’s and subsequent interviews.  The top ranked A&E Services firm will be sent a Request for Proposal based on demonstrated competence and the unique qualifications for the required work.  After receipt of the firm’s proposal, negotiations will proceed.  A single firm-fixed price contract will be negotiated with separate line items for the Pre-design and Design Services.  The Government intends to utilize a Construction Manager at Risk or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract procedure for this requirement.   Two contracts will ultimately be awarded: one to the A&E Services firm selected as a result of this notice; the other to a construction firm.  Under this concept, the CMc functions as a collaborative member of the project team.  The CMc will be responsible for all construction under a single contract and also provides expertise during the design process for the Government by checking estimates and performing constructability reviews.  It is anticipated that award of the CMc contract will follow closely behind the award of the A&E Services design contract so that the CMc can provide preconstruction services during the design phase.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase (likely at 70% design), the CMc offers a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and construction of the project will begin, before design completion.  Complete design of this project is expected to take approximately 8 months; however, construction on the Motor Pool/Firehouse, which has already been designed, could begin much earlier.  During construction, the A&E Services firm will perform construction administration services and work closely with the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc). Actual construction is estimated to commence 4-6 months after design begins and be completed within approximately 2 years. 

SELECTION CRITERIA:  In addition to the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, the following criteria will be used in the selection of the A-E firm:  

1.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their relevant experience, including relevant experience of staff members and teaming partners, specifically for pre-design services, outlining the basic requirements and information needed to procure, plan, design and construct the Integrated Facility Improvements at the PIADC.

<DESC>The United States Government intends to procure technical expertise for the development of propensity score models.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Propensity Score Method for Nonignorable Nonresponse Adjustment for health survey data.   
            
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
NCHS confronts an increasing problem of non-response, partial or unit, especially for National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Consequently missing information for survey data causes problems in contingency table or other data analysis. 
When the non-responses are estimated by modeling and incomplete counts are distributed to proper cells, the analysis with distributed data will be much more improved than the analysis only with observed data. 
It is important to develop proper models for non-response estimation and there are needs for more research on how to distribute the counts of unknown cells properly. Past research in this area addressed the Hierarchical Bayesian model for the non-ignorable non-responses in the small area problems. However it is complex and difficult to use. 
We now propose propensity score method for non-ignorable nonresponses and it differs from the usual Hierarchical Bayesian method. New method is used to allocate respondents and nonrespondents to adjustment cells using covariates related to nonrespondents; uncertainty of these adjustment cells are also taken into consideration. The analysis of the response variables is distribution-free (i.e., does not depend on model). 
This method will be applied to NCHS data systems to minimize nonresponse bias.   
 
 OBJECTIVE: 

 The objective is to provide the technical expertise for developing propensity score models to suggest ways to solve non-response in small area problems for NCHS data.  Development of computing procedures for the use of the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and analysis applications at NCHS are required.      

 SCOPE OF WORK: 

The vendor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the task outlined below. The vendor may require travel or communications with CDC to obtain data needed to illustrate the methodology.  

TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:

The vendor shall perform the following tasks in order to achieve the objective; the following activities will be carried out under the contract.

1.	Provide technical expertise in covariates selection for the non-response or small area estimation and appropriate propensity models should be most efficient.    
2.	Model selection procedure will be carried out to select the better fitting covariates among a set of competing ones. This will involve simulation and variance measures. 
3.	On the selected covariates, residual analysis will be done to assess the goodness of fit using cross validation. This is both a mathematical and computation task for the model investigation since the components (i.e., conditional means and variances) do not exist in a closed form. 
4.	Investigate robustness to the assumptions associated with the propensity score models.
5.	Perform simulation studies to assess the accuracy of the selected propensity model using quantities like mean squared error. 
6.	Use an appropriate variable (e.g., body mass index, bone mineral density, activity limitation status) from the NCHS survey data to demonstrate the procedures. 
7.	Outline a set of criteria for the comparison of alternative methods
8.	Make recommendations for further research regarding analysis of NCHS data with non-ignorable non-responses. 

GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS:

N/A

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 

The period of performance shall commence upon award of purchase order and shall continue through the next 6 months and completed no later than March 31, 2007. 

DELIVERABLES

The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the Project Officer as a result of this contract: 

1.	The preliminary plan of general propensity model for analyzing data with non-ignorable non-response data (Task items 1-6) by 3 months after the award of purchase order, but no later than November 30, 2006

2.	The final report that includes a detailed outline of criteria for comparing and evaluating alternative methods. Recommendation of further research on these topics. Complete a report or draft of a paper with the result of this research by the 6 month after the contract awarded (Task items 7-8), but no later than March 20, 2007.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors providing the requested service.  Therefore, the initial offer should  contain the offeror’s best terms.  The quotation shall include the price, prompt payment terms, the F.O.B. Point(Destination or Origin), Taxpayer Identification Number(TIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number(DUNS),and descriptive literature of the service quoted.  The quotation must reference Solicitation number 00HCPC13-2006-35340.  Quotations will be due fifteen(15) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.  Quotations may be faxed to (770)488-2670/2671, Attn.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This is a solicitation of Purchase Request F1W3L76194A100 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-12.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 336999 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is set aside for small businesses.

This solicitation is for Brand Name Only.

All responsible Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Quantity Eight (8) set SIB Broom Core P/N SIB MB 2X92805 

Line Item 0002:  Freight to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska

Justification:  The SIB cores are manufactured by Svenska Industri Borstar.  Currently there are 12 brooms in the fleet which all require the SIB cores.  Using other than the SIB cores would create excessive wear and tear and could cause significant damage to the roads. The requirement of replacement cores would be kept to a minimum since SIB warranties cores for 5 years.   SIB cores have a solid core construction.  The solid core construction prevents sand and dirt from accumulating on the inside of the broom core.   Dirt and debris in cores could cause the brooms to become off balance making the entire truck shake and harder to control.  The use of SIB cores ensures fleet integrity and will not require additional training, tools or materials.

Delivery shall be completed not later than 4 months after receipt of an order and shall be FOB Destination.

BACKGROUND:   VA's OIT is undergoing a major transformation to move toward a federated IT model that consolidates the Department's IT resources under the Chief Information Officer. As a result of the consolidation, critical skill gaps have been identified at every level of the organization, from entry level through executive leadership.  As such, the need for assistance from private contractors to reach potential candidates in the private sector and to recruit hard to fill, critical IT positions, especially at the senior management and executive levels has been identified.  Leveraging the comprehensive organizational capabilities of a robust IT personnel and technology provider will significantly enhance the Department's capability to attract and hire the specialized skills and expertise required to manage major IT programs and processes. VA recognizes the need to seek such support from an organization that is knowledgeable of the Department and holds extensive experience in recruiting executive positions that require specialized IT management and leadership skills.     The Department is also in the process of creating a new organization that consolidates the construction and facilities management functions.  In this regard, the Department will require a senior executive to lead and manage construction and facilities management operations VA-wide.  The Chief Executive Officer for Construction and Facilities Management (CEO) will be responsible for overseeing and managing the planning, design, construction, and facilities operations (including infrastructure) of the Department's major and minor construction projects.  The CEO shall administer a program for the centralized management and administration of assigned VA-owned and VA-occupied facilities, to include oversight of operations, maintenance, repairs and alterations, customer service, recycling program, and roads and grounds maintenance for all VA facilities (including Veterans Health (VHA), Veterans Benefits (VBA), and National Cemetery (NCA) Administrations) both central office and field locations.   OBJECTIVE: The first priority of the Department is to fill executive-level Senior Executive Service (SES) and GS-15 IT positions in the surrounding Washington D.C. metropolitan area. &#160; Three positions have been identified for immediate recruitment action: The Deputy CIO position of the Office of Information and Technology; the Director for Construction and Facilities Management (a senior executive service level position); and a GS 15 Systems Engineer position in the Office of Information and Technology (senior level manager position).

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. NOTE: IF THIS RFQ IS BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (SEE Bidding Instructions): Offerors quoting the brand name product that are not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor of the brand name product MUST submit a signed letter from the manufacturer of the brand name product stating the following:   "Manufacturer, has agreed to supply brand name product to Your company for the purpose of providing the supplies to the DoS." FOB DESTINAION CONUS Offerors quoting the brand name product that are not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor of the brand name product MUST submit a signed letter from the manufacturer of the brand name product stating the following: "Manufacturer, has agreed to supply brand name product to Your company for the purpose of providing the supplies to the DoS "Manufacturer, has agreed to supply brand name product to Your company for the purpose of providing the supplies to the DoS." It is required that the Sig Sauer P229 Pistol be purchased to issue to the agents who will be assigned to overseas Posts.  The above weapons will be used to replace the Department of State weapons destroyed in accordance with the Federal Property Management regulation.  This will enable the agents to provide continued protection and security for personnel. Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while traveling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability. Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is the issued pistol that all agents are trained on.  Overall length: 7.1 inches, Overall height: 5.4 inches, Overall width: 1.5 inches, Barrel length: 3.9 inches, Weight w/o mag: 28.1 oz, Mag weight: 3.0 oz, Sight radius: 5.7 inches.  State Department requires the Law Enforcement magazine which holds 13 rounds as opposed to 10 rounds and DS also requires the Trijicon night sights.   Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include the protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the weapons requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.  The Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is a unique system that our armorers have been certified to repair, and that the agents have been trained to use.  All agents must be able to pick up a weapon and use it, not just the one they were trained on, and this becomes a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons. The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  Sig Sauer is the manufacturer of the P229 Pistol. The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board (FPRB) has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS Agents.

<DESC>Amendment to RFQE48261XMMJ 0001, see questions below:  
 
Contract
 
1.  Is this a new initiative? 
	a. If no, is there an incumbent and if so, who is the incumbent?  Yes, this is a new initiative.
 2.  Is there a preferred number of pages (no more than) for the RFQ Response?   No, we are interested in reviewing whatever information you provide.  3.  What is the anticipated contract award date?   No Later than 09/30/2006.  4.  What is the anticipated 14 month period of performance? The period of performance would begin at the contract award date.  5.  Do you desire an all inclusive firm and fixed price quote (one ultimate dollar amount)?  Yes, we desire one ultimate dollar amount – a firm fixed price quote.  6.  Is there a specific price quote format you desire? No.  7.  Will you review web links if we were to include them in our RFQ Response? Certainly. Because many of the services to be provided under this RFQ are Web-based, we would anticipate that offerors would provide appropriate Web links for review.   8.  Do you anticipate a benefit to either party if the contractor is geographically proximal to your Arlington, VA offices?  No. 
	a. If yes, is there an on-site presence requirement? No. 
9.  Is monthly invoicing acceptable?  Yes.

10.   Will you accept an electronic RFQ submission on August 18, 2006?  NO.
   SOW  11.  Is there a Section 508 requirement for the site? No. The site is not intended for use by the public. Broadcasters will add their own captioning.  	a. If yes, what is the conformance level? N/A  12.  Are there multiple language requirements for the site? No.  	a. If yes, what are the language requirements? N/A  13.   Is there a “restricted access’” requirement? The site should be restricted to members of the media.

	a. If yes, does the site include the ability for new Users to sign up? The site should absolutely include the ability for new users to sign up.  	b. If yes, how will Users be authorized?
		1. Automatically, based on certain criteria? We are expecting offerors to have a mechanism already in place that evaluates and approves user applications, such that only appropriate users are authorized. We anticipate that the Web site would be one that is already up and running as a media destination – one that broadcasters and journalists already know as a credible source to obtain news footage and information. 		2. An Administrator approves and would this same Administrator also              need to manually add, modify and delete Users online? We expect the offeror to have an ongoing policy and mechanism with regard to adding, modifying and deleting users online.
 
14.  Is there a requirement to store any personally identifiable information, e.g. Social Security Numbers (SSN) or Employer Identification Numbers (EIN)? No.  15.  Is there a requirement for SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, HTTPS) Security? No.

16.  Who enters and maintains the metadata fields?  The contractor enters and maintains all metadata fields. 
 
17.  Do you require contextual searching e.g. search “swim” and get “swim”, “swam”, “swum”, etc.?  This would be beneficial, but is not a requirement.  18.  How many annual Users and/or requests in total do you anticipate?  We anticipate several thousand users annually, and at least several hundred requests, perhaps many more.

19.  How many Administrators do you anticipate? The contractor will be the administrator. NSF will send all material to the contractor and the contractor will take all necessary actions after its receipt.

20.  What are the different levels of access e.g. Admin User, View/Add/Modify User, Guest User, etc.? We expect the contractor will already have a system in place for access and we will work within that system. Recall that the Statement of Work includes a requirement that each offeror must indicate in their proposal the number of journalists who have opted to receive science and technology content alerts from the offeror. NSF's requirement is therefore that the offeror have an existing, already functioning Web site that broadcasters know and currently use as a destination to view/receive news content. 
21.  What format do you require the preview videos to be e.g. Quicktime, Real, and/or Windows Media (WMV)? Whatever format the offeror's site currently uses to provide previews to broadcasters and journalists is acceptable to us.  22.  What are the audio file formats?  Whatever format the offeror's site currently uses to provide downloadable audio files to broadcasters and journalists is acceptable to us.  23.  What are the image file formats? Whatever format the offeror's site currently uses to provide images to broadcasters and journalists is acceptable to us.  24.  Regarding Media Alerts, is this a simple text email or something more marketing oriented like a HTML and/or newsletter formatted email?  We expect the email alerts would be more than a simple text email and would be more marketing oriented. The alerts should be in the same format that broadcasters and journalists already identify as coming from the particular offeror -- the format the broadcasters/journalists always receive when the particular offeror notifies them about the availability of new material on subjects about which they have previously opted to receive notification. (As indicated in the Statement of Work, the alerts will be “sent to journalists who have previously indicated a specific desire to receive notification when new science and technology content is posted. Offerors’ proposals should indicate the number of such journalists who have opted to receive science and technology content alerts from the offeror.”)  
25.  Will the Media Alerts also appear on the website? We will follow the offeror's standard procedures on this. Recall, however, that the Statement of Work calls for the contractor to publish multimedia press packs on its Web site, summarizing NSF stories and linking to the relevant NSF multimedia content on the offeror's site.

26.  Is there an estimate to the number of tapes and shipments regarding the “Unlimited video delivery to broadcasters ...” requirement? We would hope that video deliveries would number in the many hundreds, although it conceivably could number in the thousands. Whether the bulk of these deliveries is via tape or via FTP download is a matter of broadcaster preference (and the offeror's decision on whether or not to offer FTP download). 
27.  What are the locations of these shipments?  (USA only or International?) We anticipate that tape shipments will be almost exclusively within the USA. Internet downloads, of course, can be national or international with no effect on cost to the offeror. 

28.  Is there a requirement to track online each videotape order’s delivery? No.  29.  When fulfilling videotape requests, if a single User’s request is for multiple programs, is it acceptable to combine onto a single tape or is each program to be copied onto a different tape? Combining onto a single tape is perfectly acceptable.  30.  What is the acceptable Technical Support response period e.g. immediate, within 24 hours, etc.? We would hope that someone would be available to provide support via telephone during normal business hours within about a half-hour of our placing a call for support.  31.  Does Technical Support imply a manned telephone number and or immediate (within five minutes) email response? See response to question 30 above.  32.  Are there specific disaster recovery or data redundancy requirements? No. 
33.   Has this work been done before? No.  34.   What was the contractor’s name? N/A  35.   What the total cost of the contract? N/A  36.   Because we are required to fill unlimited video requests, should we give price for filling each video request?  If not, should we provide a price based on an estimated number of requests? If so, please give us something to base the estimate on. We require a fixed price that includes filling unlimited video requests as well as all the other services called for in this RFQ. Because we have not previously worked within this distribution model (we have heretofore relied on satellite feeds), it is difficult to provide a realistic estimate. Use 750 video requests as a working number, but recognize that the actual number may be significantly higher or lower than this.  37.   Under “Other Services,” the RFQ say that we should provide unlimited technical support.  Could you please define “unlimited technical support”? See the response to question 30.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers; Past Performance and Price; Past performance will be considered approximately equal to Price. The contractor shall have 45 days after notice of award in order to complete this project. This procurement is 100% set-aside for HUBZone Small Business Concerns. This announcement, F1B3H16207A100, constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-10 and 11.

Information about CCR and ORCA are identified below along with the websites in order to register if you haven't already. STATEMENT OF WORK 1. SCOPE: The contractor shall provide all travel, plant, supervision, materials, design, and labor necessary to demolish 40 two-family housing units, located in the Bicentennial Military Family Housing area at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. 2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES: The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items. This does not mean that the work consists only of these items. But, that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer. This incidental work is to be included in the Contractor’s estimate at the time of submittal to the Contracting Officer. a. Provide to the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work, any specific plans for actions not called for in this Statement of Work, specific differing procedures for actions called for already, and plans for removal of asbestos known to exist in the buildings to be demolished. Surveys for asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are attached for the contractor’s use along with the Altus AFB standards for removal as part of a demolition project. Questions concerning Lead Based Paint or Asbestos in the units should be addressed to the 97th CES Environmental Flight. b. Assure that all utilities attached to the units are shut off prior to the start of the demolition work. Utility shutoff shall be coordinated between the contractor and the 97th Civil Engineering Squadron at Altus AFB. c. Demolish 40 duplex housing units located in Bicentennial Housing at Altus AFB, OK, some of which are two-story units. Demolition shall be accomplished using mechanical contrivances such as track-hoe, front end loader, bulldozer, or other similar equipment. Other acceptable practices are manual demolition by workmen, or mechanically assisted manual demolition. Under no circumstances may explosives be used for any part of the work. d. After demolition of the structure above the concrete slab foundations, the concrete slabs shall be demolished and hauled away. e. Contractor shall demolish and haul away all driveways leading to the units, as far as the sidewalks. If sidewalk is damaged in this process, it shall be replaced by the contractor as part of the work required by this project. e. The contractor shall have the option of salvaging any usable items from the structure prior to demolition. Examples of salvageable items may be light fixtures, water closets, lavatory sinks, cabinets, doors, etc. All salvaged items will become the property of the contractor. f. Prior to the general demolition, any required hazardous material remediation shall be accomplished. Any identified asbestos, lead-based paint, etc. shall be removed and properly disposed of before the bulk of demolition can proceed. g. Before demolition of air-conditioning units, or their removal, all refrigerants shall be removed from the units and captured in approved containers which meet all local, state, and federal rules, regulations, laws, etc., regarding capture and disposal of refrigerants. Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any such refrigerants removed as part of this project. h. Debris generated by the demolition shall be removed from the worksite by the contractor and disposed of off base in an environmentally sound manner. All debris shall be cleaned up and hauled away from the site to a state-approved landfill or recycling center. i. Haul route(s) shall be as shown on the drawings. Other haul routes may be considered, but must be approved by the government before use by the contractor. If a temporary haul road is approved, it shall be built and maintained by the contractor during the performance period of the contract, and demolished by the contractor when no longer needed, and shall be built, operated, and demolished at no additional cost to the government. After the road would be demolished, the area where it is located shall be returned to its original state. j. Capping of Utilities: · Utilities shall be capped as follows: Sewer lines shall be capped at the wyes using plugs in the wyes, or the wyes removed and capped with a pipe cap. Water lines shall be capped with repair clamps at the mains. Gas shall be capped using sweated caps on copper lines, and PVC or matching caps on plastic lines. Electrical shall be removed up to the distribution transformer and disconnected at that point, and the conductor and conduit to the house removed. · After underground utility lines are removed, the contractor shall backfill the trenches/holes made by this removal and compact the soil removed and replaced by use of walk-behind or other mechanical vibratory compactor. It is the intent of the government to have the sites cleared of all utilities to a depth of three feet up to the point of termination of utilities to remain. · After backfill and compaction, the entire work area shall be leveled by use of a small grader or other such contrivance, to leave the area graded to match up with surrounding elevations and shall include any fine grading required to leave the finished area acceptable for the installation of sod while providing positive drainage to existing ditches, drains, etc. If imported fill dirt is required to maintain existing grade lines, the fill shall be provided by the contractor as part of the project and shall be free of foreign-debris and suitable for topsoil usage. k. After grading, the contractor shall establish new sod over all areas disturbed by the demolition. The contractor shall install sod over the entire cleared and graded area. Sodding shall be accomplished in accordance with the guidelines established in the publication, “Guideline Specifications to Turfgrass Sodding”, published by Turfgrass Producers International, 1855-A Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL. Of special interest to the government is that when the turf is established after all demolition is completed, the final profile of the work area shall be level without significant bumps, ridges, knolls, or other general surface irregularities. Sod shall not be left with projecting corners or edges lapped over adjoining strips of sod. Sod shall be placed level and rolled or otherwise worked to provide a relatively even surface after it is fully established and growing. For growth establishment, the contractor will be allowed use of government provided water from existing water lines and/or fire hydrants in the area to irrigate the new turf until it is fully established. The contractor shall be responsible for providing adapters, connectors, piping, hoses, and sprinklers necessary to irrigate the grass. l. The existing rented chain-link fencing around Bicentennial Housing shall remain in place for the duration of the demolition contract. The contractor may mount signs or other materials on the fence temporarily, but must remove any such items from the fence upon completion of his work. The fence gates used for access into and out of the demolition area shall be secured at the end of each workday to assure that children or other potential trespassers will not have access to the area. The demolition contractor is hereby notified that the government does not own this fence, and any damage to the fence caused by demolition activities will be the responsibility of the contractor to repair or pay the owner of the fence for repair or replacement. At his own option and expense, the demolition contractor may erect additional fencing for whatever reason he may deem necessary or may ask that the temporary fencing be removed so that he may provide his own construction fence. Any fencing, gates, or accessories installed as part of this contract shall be removed upon acceptable completion of the work and all holes/disturbed areas returned to their previous conditions. m. The contractor shall refer to UFGS 01572 Construction and Demolition Waste Management as the guide for requirements concerning recycling, reuse, and disposal of demolished or dismantled materials and equipment, and reporting on disposition of these items. Adherence to the requirements of UFGS 01572 in all its sections and subsections shall be considered as part of this project. The contractor may refer any and all questions pertaining to this specification to the Environmental Flight of 97th CES. 3. SPECIAL SCHEDULING: The demolition shall be so scheduled as to assure that the area encompassing Liberty Circle will be worked first. Demolition in this area must be completed first in order to allow for planned construction by the new Military Family Housing privatization contractor. It is highly recommended that sod operations begin as soon as an area is completed to allow for new sod to become established. A site visit is scheduled on 7 August 2006 at 10:00 A.M. CST. Only one site visit will be available for this project. Contact MSgt Anthony Overbay or MSgt Carl See by 4:00 P.M. by not later than 6 August 2006 4:00 p.m. CST if you plan on attending the site visit.

Brand Name or Equal :

1.  The 412 MXS/MXMAPI request the Brand Name or Equal Purchase of a Kentucky Trailer/Kentucky Trailer Industries 53 foot drop frame trailer to support crash recovery operations at Edwards Air Force Base.

2.  The trailer will be equipped with 100% of crash recovery equipment used to support 26 different weapon systems with full crash recovery capability.  This trailer must be designed and constructed to be towed across unapproved roadways; the trailer will be required to travel on and off road in conditions that normal vehicles would find difficult to navigate. They developed the "drop frame" trailer systems, which have become a staple in the moving industry Kentucky trailers “drop frame” systems represent significant advances in performance over comparable straight trailers. The salient functional characteristics of Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers are essential to the 412 MXS/MXMAPI Crash Recovery operations as follows:

•	Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers are built to our specifications.

•	Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers drop frame trailers typically hold 5 - 25 percent more volume than comparable straight trailers which allow us to consolidate 26 different aircraft’s related equipment into one location for better equipment accountability.
 
•	The trailer requested will free up essential personnel and equipment needed to perform other functions during aircraft recovery operations.
   
3.  Kentucky Trailer/Kentucky Trailer Industries is the only known corporation that can build a crash recovery trailer to meet our rigid specifications.  Other trailer builders are more suited towards building vehicle trailers that are designed for on-road applications.  Our unique requirement to recover aircraft in locations where rough terrain is the norm rather than the exception require us the have the best possible design and construction possible. 

4.  As an Aircraft Repair Flight practice, we try to avoid Brand Name or Equal situations as much as possible.  There are times however, when due to mission requirements and the lack of companies that provide unique aerospace support, we are sometimes forced to use the Brand Name or Equal process.  We will continue to do our best to try and avoid these situations in the future.

Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the one (1) Crash Recovery Scene Trailer with custom options described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete quote including delivery FOB destination Edwards AFB CA 93524.  Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.

<DESC>Synopsis/Solicitation F1T0EB6207A300, Thermal Imaging and Measurement System, is amended as follows:

1.	“MCT” is deleted from the frame rate specification.
2.	“NUS 3 Tables” is corrected to read “3 NUC Tables.”
3.	The response date is changed to 2:00 pm Central Time on 17 August 2006.
4.	The following questions and answers are provided:

a.	Question: Can you define performance requirements behind the filter wheel requirement? Can the filters be manually changed between testing and the collection of camera data? 
Answer: During a test, data will be collected with four different filters.  The camera is in a flight motion table and it is not safe for personnel to get close to the camera while the table is in operation.  The remote control allows the operator to change the filter without having to de-energize the table.  The filter wheel does not have to move very fast.  Data is collected, the filter position is changed, and then more data is collected.  The time for the filter to change position is measured in 10’s of seconds.

b.	Question: A MWIR InSb camera is specified, but the frame rate spec references MCT. Please clarify this discrepancy.  
Answer: The detector is an InSb array. The frame rate spec is for the detector.  MCT should be deleted from the frame rate specification.  

c.	Question: What is meant by “NUS 3 Tables”? 
Answer: “NUS 3 tables” should be corrected to read “3 NUC tables”.

d.	Question: What is CIRRUS Control Software? 
Answer: Cirrus control software controls the camera.  It adjusts integration time and frame rate, it performs 1 and 2 point nonuniformity corrections,  It allows the NUC tables to be downloaded and uploaded from a computer. 

e.	Question: What lenses, if any, are required? 
Answer: The camera must be compatible with our existing JADE lenses.

5.	All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
