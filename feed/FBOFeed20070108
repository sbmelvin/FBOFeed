<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue an Order under NAVAIR Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-05-G-0026 to procure services and materials to accomplish the design and flight worthiness testing (FWT) of a form/fit/function, retrofittable digital heads-up display (DHUD) flight demonstration unit on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet (USN/FMS).  Additionally, the procurement may include options for further qualifications testing.  The current Heads Up Display (HUD) in the F/A-18 is a critical flight instrument.  When the HUD is inoperative, the aircraft is non-mission capable until the HUD is repaired.  The DHUD will replace the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) with a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) projection engine backlit by a solid-state high-intensity lamp system.

<DESC>The full text of this announcement along with additional technical requirements are provided as attachment M6785407I3021.zip to this notice. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Combat Equipment and Support Systems (CESS) will host a Physical Training Uniform Industry Conference during the Outdoor Retailer (OR) Show in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Specifically, the conference will be held from 0800 to 1700 on 29 January 2007, at the Grand America Hotel located at 555 South Main St, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, phone number 801-258-6000.  The Industry Conference on 29 January will consist of a briefing, followed by an open question and answer session, and close with individual sessions no longer than 30 minutes in length.  If your company is exhibiting at the OR Show, please schedule an appointment to meet at your booth on either 27 or 28 January in lieu of scheduling an appointment for 29 January.  If companies are not able to attend the conference in Salt Lake City, an alternative date for meetings is set for individuals at Quantico on an appointment only basis.  Details for scheduling all meetings will be prov!  ided at the end of this announcement.  Participation in this Industry Conference, the OR Show or at MARCORSYSCOM, is totally voluntary and in no way obligates the government to award any contracts or pay any cost associated with such participation.  This conference is part of MARCORSYSCOM’s effort to identify potential sources and best practice information regarding the availability, design and development of a Physical Training (PT) jacket and pant set that will provide protection from physical elements such as rain.  At the conference, MARCORSYSCOM will provide an overview of current issues, uses, desired delivery schedule, capability needs and constraints, and provide other information and answers to written questions or concerns received before the conference date.  A determination has not yet been made as to whether or not to set the requirement aside for small businesses.  Therefore, the conference will also serve MARCORSYSCOM as a tool for surveying the marketplace t!  o determine the availability of qualified small businesses to fulfill  the requirement.  The Marine Corps would like to explore design capabilities and technologies available (to include commercial and modified commercial solutions) in a physical training running suit that will allow Marines to train and be comfortable in all types of weather.  This suit must also be suitable for Marines to wear on liberty. Also important is the requirement that any design submitted be branded with the Marine Corps logo and name to facilitate the use of the uniform as a recruiting tool throughout the Marine Corps.  Use of the Marine Corps logo shall be patent protected.  The suit should also be compatible with the existing PT clothing system which includes the following:  a synthetic olive drab t-shirt, olive drab physical training shorts, olive drab cotton sweatshirt and sweatpants. At a minimum, the contractor shall show improvements from the current sweat suit combination in improved fit, comfort, and reduced weight.  The first layer of clothing the Marine w!  ears is the base layer to include a t-shirt and PT shorts, both of which have moisture wicking, quick drying and antimicrobial characteristics.  Fabrics that possess a micro fiber hand are highly desirable so long as they meet durability requirements.  For liners, moisture management, weight, antimicrobial characteristics and elasticity are all critical considerations. Additionally, the jacket and pant set must be breathable, quick drying, machine washable, possess anti-microbial properties, and be reflective, water resistant and durable.  Appropriate industry standard testing during the source selection process will determine the quality of any offeror’s submittal with respect to the above listed properties.  However, potential offerors should plan to present and submit results of any independent testing available that will provide proof that the submitted design conforms to the above properties.  Berry Amendment restrictions will apply to any future procurement; therefore!   offerors will be required to certify proposed articles are Berry Amen dment compliant and may also be required to provide additional information confirming compliance. NOTE, THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS NOTICE AND AT THE INDUSTRY CONFERENCE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME.  Detailed requirements and instructions will be provided through a formal solicitation.  A formal solicitation has not yet been developed, however a solicitation is planned for release during fiscal year 2007. During the source selection process offerors may be limited to one prototype design per proposal.  It is anticipated that the designs will go through an initial down select using stated requirements provided in the solicitation and the testing requirements provided below as the basis for selection of the top four designs. Designs proposed will be evaluated by actual Marine users in conjunction with government personnel and a determination will be made on desired design features. Fifty samples of the four semi-final designs selecte!  d will be purchased to enable Marines to proceed with the next phase of evaluation, for a combined total of 200 samples to be purchased.  An in-depth web survey and field user evaluation of the four semi-final designs selected will then determine the final design slated for production.  Production quantities for the final design are anticipated to be at least 40,000 sets with the intent to sustain equivalent quantities through Defense Supply Center Philadelphia .  However, this is only a preliminary estimate and is subject to change at any time.

IT IS A SET-ASIDE FOR HUB-ZONE AND/OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES. No single option period will exceed 12 months or one year.  The value of this contract is approximately $3,900,000. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, management, tools, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation, incidental engineering and other items required to provide services for both refuse collection and recycling as described in the Performance of Work Statement (PWS) at Naval Station, Great Lakes, IL.  The services to be performed shall include, but not limited to, collection and disposal of solid waste, resulting from residential, industrial, commercial and community activities; removal, collection, processing and marketing of recyclable material, as well as report tonnage (1300 tons of paper and cardboard per year, 180-200 tons of metal, 300 pounds of cans, 1 ton of plastic and 25-30 tons of pallets) spent for recycling; and collection and composting of landscape waste.  White Goods (such as refrigerators, freezers, ranges, washers and dryers, etc.) are included in this specification.  The collection, processing and disposal will be ordered under Indefinite Quantity Spec. Item 4 (EMALL). These operations shall be performed in accordance with Section H or on a task order in furnish all labor, supervision, tools, material, transportation and equipment and materials (including a ladder for access to trailers) required to perform refuse collection, disposal and recycling; to manage and dispose of Medical Waste; and to secure a site for the disposal of Landfill Waste (25 mile radius of installation) such as grease waste, asbestos waste, white goods, Great Lakes, by Government Vehicles.  The Offeror who is awarded the contract shall have access to landfills and/or transfer stations that are not legally prohibited from accepting the refuse requirements of this contract, which are gathered from the state of Illinois.  The State of Wisconsin has imposed legal restrictions on the disposal of Illinois solid waste.  Therefore, disposal sites located in Wisconsin cannot be utilized for disposal of Illinois Solid Waste during the base period and all option periods.  Although some aspects of these restrictions were invalidated by the seventh circuit court of appeals in 1995, the court suggested a means by which restrictions could be imposed so that it is not clear whether Illinois Waste can be accepted for disposal in Wisconsin.  The Small Business Size Standard is $11,500,000.00.  Best Value Source selection procedures will be price and technical proposals once the solicitation is issued. However, performance is deemed greater than price.  Anticipate the Solicitation will be released on or about 20 February 2007.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation notice - NAIC code 562910 for procurement of environmental remediation services for multiple properties in Omaha, NE with Elevated Blood Levels (EBL) whose non-foundation soil is greater than or equal to 800 mg/kg lead.  Remediation will include:  1) pre-removal actions; 2) removal; and, 3) post-removal actions.  EPA's objective is to achieve "property closeout", which requires removing lead-contaminated soil from select properties until an average concentration of 400 ppm is reached in near-surface soils and restoring the affected property to pre-removal conditions. In addition, this contract shall also be the vehicle through which anomolous properties are remediated.  Anomolous properties are those residental properties that, for one reason or another, do not conform to the norm and require more extensive services than usual to achieve property closeout. The contractor shall be required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  Remediation shall be conducted pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and National Contingency Plan (NCP) requirements. These services shall be performed at multiple properties in Omaha, NE.  EPA anticipates issuing a fixed rate ID/IQ contract with performance incentive for these services.  Estimated dollar ceiling for this procurement is $2,400,000.00 if all options are exercised.  The IFB is anticipated to be issued on or about January 23, 2007.  The IFB will be posted at:  www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm .

A contract shall be issued for a BioRobot M48, the M48 Infectious Disease CD application package and installation.  Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that Qiagen is the only company which has a 48 sample capacity instrument that uses non-proprietary consumerables; offering substantial savings.  Additionally, the standard chemistry being used is that of Qiagen and we do not have to re-validate results on a new instrument with limited capacity, further hampering throughput.   Note 22 applies herein.  The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1):  FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Warrior Wellness Pilot Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.

This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available.     Requests for the same will be disregarded.     THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. 

GENERAL INFORMATION:  A solicitation permitting for full and open competition is being considered by the Government.  However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.

The anticipated period of performance of the pilot program would begin on 01 April 2007 and run for a twelve month period.  It is envisioned that a requirements contract would be established at time of initial award allowing for four (4) additional ordering periods in the contract.  Each additional ordering period would run for twelve (12) months.  The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all ordering periods would be 01 April 2007 to 31 March 2012.
  
Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Pilot Program addressing the following:

Mentorship Program:  Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.  

Wellness:  Increase the wounded warriors, families, and hospital staffs awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.  

Community Outreach:  Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition to on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors

	Resource Networks:  Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs.  The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warriors recovery outcome.

The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:  

	a.  Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery way-ahead and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.

	b.  Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.

	c.  A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.

	The anticipated period of performance for the Warrior Wellness Pilot Program is 12 months.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION SERVICES DOLPH COLLIERY MINE FIRE OLYPHANT, LACKAWANNA CO., PA WB-06-035 Inspection Demand                         Pre-Bid is January 16, 2007                    1:00 PM The project will begin with installation of the E & S Controls and Clearing and Grubbing. Very quickly, the waterline installation, sewer line re-route, drilling, and excavation in unconsolidated material will commence. Eventually, we hope to have 2 draglines working 20 hrs./day - 7 days/week for ~125 days. The project will involve ~750,000cy of excavation and conclude with site restoration.  These activities will necessitate a significant amount of inspection.  During the busiest times (when 2 drag lines are working), 2 inspectors/shift will be needed with another overlapping and/or working in the trailer compiling maps/cross sections/summarizing quantities and organizing reports for a total of 350 inspection hrs./week. The firm should stagger the schedules to allow at least a 1 hour overlap between shifts so that site conditions and situations can be discussed by inspectors. At slower times, possibly during startup and during grading & demobilization, we may only need 1 inspector/shift with another overlapping for a total of 210 hours/week. During the first week until equipment is brought onsite and lights can be installed, the inspection need may be as little as 140 hours per week.  The Inspectors will be working in difficult conditions, including hazardous terrain, blasting, artificial lighting, winter weather, overhead equipment, and the normal threats posed by an underground mine fire. These threats include dangerous gases (CO) and hot air borne materials. Access to the work site will likely require a 4-wheel drive vehicle with clearance. The Construction Contractor will provide a heated trailer that contains tables, chairs, electricity, and water. A portable toilet will also be provided for the workforce. While one inspector may be situated in the trailer for most of a shift, it is anticipated that the other inspectors will be primarily working outside during the shift. The inspectors should be capable of being outside in the elements for extended periods of time, and be able to get around in the varied terrain of the worksite to perform gas and temperature monitoring, as well as volume and area calculations. The successful bidder for inspection must provide gas measurement equipment and shielded thermocouples and meters that are accurate in moist environments to depths of 150 feet. The Inspection firm will be required to present weekly reports on all operations to OSM no later than Monday of the following week. The inspection firm will also be responsible for indicating the location of boreholes on the project plans, preparing cross sections as requested and performing other duties as assigned. The inspection firm must be capable of providing all video and still photography in digital format. The important high quality photos selected by the COR must be provided in a captioned bound format, approved by the COR. The remaining photos must be provided in a COR approved digital format.  Also, the video must be provided in a DVD format. The inspection firm will be allocated up to 24 hours to prepare a detailed final report. OSM plans to issue a single contract with one firm, to provide all the inspectors needed. All Inspectors onsite will have to be certified by OSM for this type of work. The certification process begins by submitting a resume to OSM and, if approved, the candidate must attend an unpaid orientation that involves viewing 8 hours of video  Prospective firms must submit a technical proposal that describes in a detailed Management Plan  how the firm will provide and schedule all of the Inspectors necessary. It must include the names of the OSM Mine Fire Certified Inspectors as well as the names of the other OSM Certified Inspectors who will work along with the Mine Fire Inspector. At least one OSM Certified Mine Fire Inspector must be onsite at all times during each work shift, while additional inspectors on the shift must be OSM Certified in Drilling and/or Excavation & Backfilling. The technical proposal shall provide a contingency plan in the event that a key inspector is sick, injured, or otherwise unable to perform his/her duties. The firm will be required to develop and maintain all reports and records regarding contract bid items and quantities. This includes, but is not limited to, drilling records, excavation, blasting, water usage, sewer line work, as well as photographic and video records. It will involve performing field measurements for pay items that require area measurements for payment. Volumetric measurements for payment regarding the two excavation items will be compiled by others, however daily volumetric estimates of excavation must be calculated by the Inspector. The Inspector will also be required to perform other related duties as requested by the COR. Each Inspector must provide and carry a cell phone at all times while at work.     TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA The Technical Proposal separately addressing  the respective geographical areas,                            " Instructions to Offerors" relative to Statement of Work requirements, will be evaluated and point scored by a committee of technically qualified OSM employees assisted by OSM Contracting personnel in accordance with factors listed below: 1.	Implement and supervise Required Work (reflected in Management Plan) - 30% a.	Availability and allocation of staff resources and equipment to meet requirements  -  15% b.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, Copenhagen Hospital Corporation, Copenhagen, Denmark, for a multi-year contract as defined by FAR Part 17 Multi-Year Contracts (specifically, FAR Part 17.104, Part 17.105, & Part 17.106) .  The contractor will provide NLM with at least twice-yearly updates to the English and Spanish versions of SNOMED CT, originally developed by the College of American Pathologists, and a license to incorporate SNOMED-CT updates into the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (National Library of Medicine registered trademarks); to use SNOMED-CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLM's production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute SNOMED-CT, within the UMLS Metathesaurus or otherwise, free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical purposes.  SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive, multi-axial, controlled terminology intended for use in patient, public health, and research data.  SNOMED CT has been recommended as U.S. standard by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, has been adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, and is part of several U.S. Interoperability Specifications recently released by the Health Information Technology Standards Panel under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services.  In June 2003, NLM entered into a 5-year contract with the College of American Pathologists to obtain updates to SNOMED CT under similar license terms.  The College of American Pathologists has announced its intention to transfer their intellectual property in SNOMED-CT to the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization in early 2007 (reference FAR 52.217-2 Cancellation with respect to contract cancellation).

Since SNOMED-CT will then become a proprietary product of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, NLM has determined that the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization is the only source capable of providing the software and the ongoing software updates. Responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  Please refer to Numbered Note 22.
		
If you have any questions, please contact Maxwell Kimpson at (301) 496-6546 or by email at kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 Servers, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers, and related infrastructure equipment described in paragraph (2) have been identified as key components of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.After extensive testing, the HP servers were the only servers found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>HP CTO FACTORY BUILT CONFIGURATIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE<BR><BR>ALL SERVER CONFIGURATIONS MUST BE FULLY INTEGRATED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT<BR><BR>REPOSTED TO INCLUDE TERMS: 1) CTO ACCEPBABLE 2) ALL SERVER COMPONENTS MUST BE INTEGRATED COMPLETELY PRIOR TO SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY.<BR><BR>

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is upgrading the NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) for improved operations.  The existing wind profilers are vertical looking radars, the deployment of which commenced in approximately 1990.  The existing wind profilers operate continuously and provide upper air wind data which the NWS uses in a variety of ways.  In upgrading the NPN, the NWS expects to improve the resolution of wind phenomena in time and space (horizontal and vertical) and accuracy; enhance end-to-end observing system availability, access, archive, quality assurance, and timeliness monitoring; and to make use of the real-time wind profiles as an integrating sensor for a seamless system of systems.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 will be issued on or about November 3, 2006 and will close on or about February 2, 2007.  This solicitation will encompass a development phase culminating in the delivery, installation, and testing of a first article wind profiler, followed by a production phase involving delivery and installation of up to 54 wind profilers.  [It is expected that all installations will take place within the United States.]  Additionally, the production phase will provide for initial sparing and initial maintenance of the wind profilers (until the wind profilers are transitioned to Government maintenance).  Both the development and production phases will include provisions for associated services, such as training, and associated supplies, including documentation.  The solicitation will allow for either the upgrade of the existing wind profilers or the replacement of the existing wind profilers.  The solicitation will be structured to allow for up to two awards for the development phase, with a down-select to one contractor for the production phase; however, the Government will not be obliged to make two awards for the development phase.  The Government expects that completion of the work called for by the solicitation will take place within five years after award.  All responsible sources may respond to Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 by submitting a proposal which shall be considered by NOAA.  See Notes 12 and 26.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This is not a request for offers or proposals.  This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. Information received will be used to determine the availability of technically capable and otherwise responsible small business firms that would be interested in submitting offers for this anticipated solicitation. This includes firms that are certified as HUBZone small business concerns and/or small disadvantaged business concerns under the 8(a) program in addition to service disabled veteran owned small business.  Additional information related to small business programs can be found at the http://www.sba.gov//index.html. 

The General Services Administration (GSA) Northeast and Caribbean Region (R2) is conducting a market survey for Construction Manager as agent (CMa) services.  The CMa services are related to the fa?ade repair and slate roof replacement project for the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  Base contract Design Phase CMa services may include but are not limited to the following:  monitoring A-E progress, performing design and constructability reviews, preparing and reviewing cost estimates, budget control, scheduling, record keeping, reporting on progress, resolving problems, Value Engineering, Total Building Commissioning, scheduling meetings and performing administrative services.  Optional Construction Phase CMa services may include but are not limited to the following:   inspection, schedule control, record keeping, reporting progress, safety monitoring, conducting meetings, submittal processing, testing, Total Building Commissioning, processing progress payments, assisting the A-E in responding to requests for information (RFIs), preparing Contract Modification(s), processing claims and claims prevention, monitoring labor provisions, and photo documentation.  The Estimated Construction Cost for this anticipated requirement ranges from $45,000,000 to $55,000,000. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 236220 and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $31.0 million dollars in annual receipts averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years.  

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.  The 575,000 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior?s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Historic Building Preservation Plan (HBPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further fa?ade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior. The delivery method for this project will be Construction Manager as constructor (CMc). The Government anticipates selecting up to three (3) CMcs to provide Design Phase consultations and recommendations on scheduling, cost impacts, alternative design implications, building systems, construction materials and constructability. During the Design Phase of this project, the selected CMa firm will provide base contract services, and will work with GSA, the A-E and the CMcs.  At the conclusion of the Design Phase, one (1) of the CMcs will be selected to serve as the General Contractor providing the required construction services and serving as the single point of responsibility during construction.  At that time, the GSA may request that the selected CMa firm provide optional Construction Phase services.

This contract will be procured under the Brooks Act and FAR Part 36. Award of the contract is contingent upon funding approval.  

Companies who have the necessary construction management experience, as well as an interest in this project, should submit a statement of capabilities, which is not a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the firm?s expertise and experience on projects similar in scope to the one described in this notice.  Firms should indicate eligibility for SBA programs and whether they are a Small Business, SBA-certified HUBZone, SBA-certified 8(a) or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). Additional information related to SBA programs can be found at www.sba.gov. 

Interested firms should submit a Written Letter of Interest to Miriam Lopez, Contracting Officer.  Please FAX your response to 212/264-0588, Attn: Miriam Lopez or submit through email to miriam.lopez@gsa.gov or mail your response to the General Services Administration, PBS Project Management Division, 2PCB, Attn:  Ms. Miriam Lopez, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1639,  New York, NY 10278 by January 23, 2007.  For additional information regarding this potential opportunity, please contact Ms. Lopez at 212/264-9491.

1.0	PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The Global IT Modernization Program under the purview of the Director of IRM/OPS/PMA is responsible for refreshing 25% of overseas workstations, and a percentage of OpenNet printers for overseas sites on an annual basis.   Due to the continuous pressure to reduce IT life cycle costs, PMA is exercising due diligence in exploring potential alternative methodologies to meet current operational requirements.  Vendors will be responsible for storing OpenNet workstations and printers at their facility, installing a GITM provided image on DoS OpenNet workstations, power on and print test OpenNet printers, provide GITM with location specific serial numbers for CPU?s, monitors and printers, and notification when subject equipment is inducted into shipping consistent with Diplomatic Pouch Guidelines and Restrictions to DoS Embassies and Consulates overseas.   

2.0	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

GITM will provide the vendor with site specific quantities in addition to providing updated copies and or access to the Unclassified Diplomatic Pouch Guidelines and Restrictions for packing / shipping instructions.  No partial shipments of workstations, monitors and printers are authorized.  All shipments must be 100 percent complete.  The Department of State will reimburse for shipping expenses upon receipt of GBL?s / invoices. 

For the purposes of this RFI, vendors can assume a total of 262 overseas sites in addition to the following quantities in determining their cost estimates:

Annual Quantity of Overseas OpenNet Workstations:  6,067
Annual Quantity of Overseas OpenNet Monitors: 6,067
Annual Quantity of Overseas OpenNet Printers:  970

Workstation Imaging

GITM would provide a bootable ISO image (DVD - over 2 GB) that would need to be applied to every workstation prior to shipment.  This image would be made available on a DoS FTP site, or uploaded to a vendor FTP site.  Reasonable advance notice (at least several days) would be given of the release of a new version.  See Attachment (A).  

Note:  The GITM image is structured to permit the addition of new drivers, hot fixes, or new software to the workstation during the loading of the image on the workstations.  Additional software such as the types mentioned above could be released by GITM at any time for incorporation into the new workstations and GITM would provide advance notice.  The vendor must provide prompt notification to GITM of any problems with an image.

GITM will provide a power cord to be included with each workstation to be included with the shipment.  
All equipment must be labeled with an approved U.S. Government Unclassified property label (DoS provided).  

GITM Quality Assurance personnel will perform periodic random sampling to verify / validate compliance of the workstation imaging process at the vendor facility.  

The vendor will provide a weekly status report documenting the following areas:

?	Total number of workstations imaged
?	Total number of printers tested
?	Total number of locations awaiting shipment (staged for shipping)
?	Total number of shipments by location 
?X	Serial Numbers
?X	Part Number
?X	Manufacturer
?X	Date shipped
?	Total number of DOA equipment

The vendor must provide GITM with a shipping manifest prior to actual shipping.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case that FBO is not available. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division. Forward deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) have documented requirements for a GMVAS which provides SOF operators the ability to navigate vehicles, conduct surveillance, detect, identify and track threats in all light and weather conditions. Although a single sensor system is desired to meet the SOF requirements for ground mobility applications, currently no single system can provide all the capabilities required to satisfy performance and capability requirements. Therefore, a suite of vehicle mounted multi-sensor systems is envisioned which will provide a driver visual enhancement system (referred to as Driver GMVAS), a short-range (<2KM) situational awareness module (referred to as Short Range ¨C GMVAS) and man-sized target detection / identification / tracking module (referred to as Long Range ¨C GMVAS).  Each multi-sensor module will be interchangeable among SOF vehicles and interoperable with a central control station utilizing open architecture, interfaces and data outputs, thereby making each vehicle mission configurable. This collective suite of sensor modules will be identified as the GMVAS. This sources sought is for the Short Range ¨C GMVAS (SR-GMVAS) module. This sensor module will provide short-range surveillance, identification, detection and limited tracking capabilities in all light and weather conditions.  To provide this ability it is anticipated this system will include available technologies like low light level, I2 or CCD cameras and thermal imagers.  The enhanced visual images will be transmitted to the navigator via a night vision compatible display or possibly a HUD, which will be capable of fusing the images to provide optimal viewing.  The navigator will be able to control the FOV with a control mechanism, which will pan/tilt or slew the sensor module. Tracking capability will be provided via the pan/tilt/slew ability and enhanced by a visible or infrared (IR) pointer integral to the sensor module.  It is anticipated that the SR-GMVAS sensor module will be deployed as standard equipment on High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV). The SR-GMVAS module will be mounted to the exterior of the crew area and potentially on a telescoping mast. Mounting location will provide maximum FOV and range for all sensors. Mounting location shall not obstruct the view of the vehicle crew and shall not interfere with the fire zone of vehicle weapons when nested. The max weight shall be less than 30 lbs. The sensor module shall be constructed of, or coated with, neutral colored non-reflective materials to reduce probability of adversary detection. The multi-sensor module shall have a pan/tilt, non-stabilized capability at a minimum. Ideally, the multi-sensor module should stabilize all the internal sensors line of sight at all pointing angles and not be degraded by the ground vehicle vibration, shock, or movement in either off-road or on-road conditions. Sensor shall be responsive enough and have sufficient FOV to detect, at a minimum, tanks (at 9km); trucks (at 5.6km); man (at 3.7km) and helos (at 9km). Sensors shall re!  cognize tanks (at 5.6km); trucks (at 3.7km); man (at 3km) and helos (at 5.6km). Sensor modules shall be capable of producing visual images in low light / no light, in the presence of obstructions and in all weather conditions. With respect to the I2 technology, the system will mitigate the effect of halo/blooming. The system shall transition between extreme lighting conditions within 30 seconds without loss of operationally effective vision. The sensor display shall be visible to SOF operators with naked eye and when aided with visual augmentation systems. The display shall have a selectable visible mode and non-visible mode. The display emissions in the non-visible mode shall be multi-spectral and visible between 730nm and 1000nm. The visual image will be sent to a Night Vision / Day Light compatible display, which can be mounted to provide easy viewing by the navigator. The display will have the capability to switch between sensors (e.g. thermal image and LLL/ I2/CCD imag!  e) to provide optimal view. Ideally, display should blend (fusion) the se images in color to allow optimal viewing. The SR-GMVAS module shall be capable of illumination in the non-visible spectrum.  The sensor module shall also be capable of pointing in the non-visible spectrum and ultimately should be capable of determining target range. Device shall operate in the same electromagnetic spectrum as aiming / pointing / designating lasers, and IR traced ammo used by U.S. forces. Sensors and sensor modules shall be hardened to reduce the probability of electro-magnetic interference with or from platform weapons, communications and power train. Sensors shall be filtered to reduce susceptibility to electro-magnetic environmental effects and optical augmentation without degrading sensor performance. System must support capture of still / live imagery and be capable of feeding data in analog and digital format to external display or recording devices. Sensors shall not emit detectable light or noise from a distance of 2 meters. They shall reduce retro!  -reflection to the maximum extent possible without degrading sensor performance. System must be powered by the vehicle12-24 VDC, ¡Ü10 amps. Device must be compatible with Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) gear and useable by individuals wearing cold weather protective clothing. The system mounts shall have the capability to be quickly installed / retrofitted on all designated SOF training and tactical ground vehicles. The SR-GMVAS module control mechanism shall enable the navigator to remotely turn the sensors and display off and on, and switch or fuse display images. The control mechanism shall enable the navigator to select and fire desired sensors, magnify images, track targets and pan, tilt or slew sensors to attain optimal FOV. System shall function in temperatures ranging from -40¡ã C to +50¡ã C (-40¡ã F to +122¡ã F) and in environments where relative humidity ranges from 0-100%. Sensors shall be able to withstand ground vehicle shock. System shall be sealed !  to ensure it functions reliably in all environments where water (to in clude creek fording), fine dust, sand and other particulate matter both in air, and in solution, are prevalent.  This sources sought is being issued to identify potential sources to manufacture the Short Range - GMVAS. The Government is interested in utilizing the best available existing technologies or a combination thereof (i.e. non-developmental items, commercial-off-the shelf or modified commercial-off-the-shelf).

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Institute of National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business organizations interested in this requirement.  This acquisition may be solicited as full and open or as small business set-aside including 8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veterans as defined by the Small Business Act.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Small Business sources are sought that possess the capability to provide support services described below for the NCRR.  The new contract is anticipated to be awarded on September 30, 2007 for a period of five years. 

As part of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research process to Reengineer the Clinical Research Enterprise, NIH issued an RFA for institutional Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA).  The purpose of the CTSA initiative, which is a joint NCRR and NIH Roadmap activity, is to assist institutions to forge a uniquely transformative, novel, and integrative academic home for Clinical and Translational Science.  These new Clinical and Translational Science entities are expected to serve as a magnet that concentrates basic, translational, and clinical investigators, community clinicians, clinical practices, networks, professional societies, and industry to facilitate the development of new professional interactions, programs, and research projects. It is anticipated that these new institutional arrangements, coupled with innovative advanced degree programs, will foster the development of a new discipline of Clinical and Translational Science that will be both broader and more pervasive than the classical and separate domains of translational research and clinical investigation.  When fully implemented in 2012, about 60 CTSA programs will be supported.

As part of this cooperative initiative, CTSA awardees will participate in trans-CTSA Steering Committees in areas of broad interest to discuss and address national issues through sharing and cooperation.  Although NIH anticipates that awardees will differ in their internal structures and emphasis, informatics, human protection, training, and clinical service are envisioned to be areas of shared interest with national level Steering Committees for each area.  Project management and technical support of these Steering Committees in their cooperative activities will be necessary for accomplishment of shared projects.
The purpose of this acquisition is to seek small business organizations capable of providing project management and technical support for the institutional CTSA program.  The Contractor shall provide technical support to the NCRR Division of Clinical Research for CTSA activities where the current staffing and research management resources are limited.  Contractor activities shall include: 1) project management/executive secretary staffing for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working groups; 2) establish, maintain, and manage a web based password protected collaborative workspace for above groups; 3) establish, maintain, and manage a public CTSA web site for dissemination of activities and products; 4) logistics and meeting support services for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Group meetings; 5) provision of qualified subcontracted or consultant technical expertise in a timely fashion; 6) administrative management and oversight for the review process of informatics pilot projects; and 7) provision of contract closeout and orderly transition.

(d)	the ability of the organization to provide high level project management staffing  for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Groups; the personnel must provide careful attention to detail, organizational skill, excellent oral and written skills, ability to work independently, and working knowledge of a variety of technical areas related to clinical and translational research

(e)	the ability of the organization to provide appropriate project management and planning processes, including staffing, scheduling, reporting, and cost control; ability and experience of the organization to effectively transition at the start and end of similar contracts and to adapt quickly to different workload levels over time

(f)	experience and competence in managing the independent review and evaluation of scientific and technical proposals in a timely fashion, including the provision of evaluation reports

(g)	the ability of the organization to develop and revise technical documents, in the most efficient and cost-effective manner

(h)	the ability of the organization to provide IT support services, including programming, website development and hosting and database development; the ability to provide password protected web based collaborative work space for collaborative groups with appropriate attention to IT security issues.

(i)	the ability of the organization to arrange and support professional meetings in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including consideration of travel and other meeting-related tasks and expenses; ability to provide access to and management of various mechanisms for virtual meetings, including but not limited to, telephone and video conferencing

(j)	the ability of the organization to meet with NCRR staff at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland with as little as two hours advance notice


This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and none is available.  An original and two copies of the capability statement should be submitted to:

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY, A SOLICITATION WILL NOT FOLLOW THIS REQUEST

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the following districts:  Atlanta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida.  The DHS-FLETC is in process of determining the viability of issuance of Basic Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's) encompassing each district. The estimated time of performance will be a base year period of three (3) years, with two (2) one-year option periods.  BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the DHS-FLETC and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the DHS-FLETC and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the DHS-FLETC has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis.

The Contracting Officer, will reserve the right to award subsequent task orders using one of the following methods:  Tradeoff (aka Best Value); Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA); or Price only.  When awarding using Tradeoff or LPTA, Contracting Officer may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to proceed with task order procurement on a sole source basis, or to compete an action among select BOA holders, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond and Performance and Payment Bond for each Task Order over $100,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by DHS-FLETC to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that DHS-FLETC solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.   DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work will involve a variety of trades, including, but not limited to, carpentry, road repair, roofing, excavation, interior and exterior electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, concrete masonry, welding and HVAC.   EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Emergency repairs include, but are not limited to, broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others.

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick (Glynco), Georgia.   The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.  Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Government approval as well as a price proposal.   SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.

The list below represents the required  munitions capability that is of interest to the US Government.  This does not  conclude the list, as new munitions may be required in the future, but it is by  no means an all encompassing list and it should be noted that as new munitions  enter the global scene it could be required to procure them.

<SUBJECT>A -- DARPA Microsystems Technology Symposium
<DESC>In support of the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's (DARPA's) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) is sponsoring the Microsystems Technology Symposium. Microsystems technology, as embodied in electronics, photonics, and MEMS components, has been the engine for innovation over the past 50 years. By driving down the size, weight, and power of ever higher performance components, Microsystems technology has enabled a revolution in macro-system capability by delivering new capabilities in sensing, communication, energy management, actuation, and processing. 
The Microsystems Technology Office has the mission to develop beyond leading edge Microsystems technology to deliver new capability for Defense platforms. In the past, MTO has sponsored research that enabled such critical technologies as: complex integrated circuit design tools, microwave frequency monolithic integrated circuits, semiconductor ultra violet sources and detectors, high throughput optical fiber networks, uncooled infrared imaging focal plane arrays, micro-accelerometers and gyroscopes, and chip scale atomic clocks.
MTO is sponsoring this Symposium in San Jose, CA on March 5-7, 2007 to expand the dialogue on directions for future Microsystems technology that will enable new platform capability. These platforms will extend from nanotechnology enabled chemical and biological detectors to handheld wireless assistants to intelligent imaging systems to adaptable sensors to unmanned vehicles. The platform advances will arise from component improvements in sensing, communication, energy management, actuation, and processing. As component scaling continues and complexity grows, new challenges and opportunities for Microsystems research are emerging. Examples include the development of a new class of adaptable components, exploitation of unique quantum phenomena, exploitation of new sensing modalities, and the heterogeneous integration of multiple technologies at the chip-scale. The goal of the symposium is to convene experts from across all aspects of Microsystems technology to enhance the dialog on future research directions.
Please note that this workshop is not a formal solicitation.  The Symposium will consist of a series of keynote and invited talks, panel sessions, and posters session. Attendance is targeted at those actively involved in Microsystems research and development with demonstrated knowledge of emerging Microsystems directions. Attendees will have the opportunity to hear from MTO program managers who are directing novel Microsystems research, listen to leading researchers who are opening new Microsystems frontiers, and contribute to poster presentations or panel discussions, to assist in defining the next generation of Microsystems opportunities and challenges.
MTO hopes you can join us in San Jose March 5-7, 2007 to help chart the course for the future of Microsystems technology.

The remaining portion of the units shall be inspected by efficient means effective to determine serviceability through repairs or replacement.

After repairs, the units should have a lifecycle of at least 5 years of trouble free operations.  The life limited parts such as high pressure air tanks must be checked for expiration and replaced if the expiration date is within the 5 years of expected lifecycle.  All the wiring and associated circuitry must be inspected, repaired, or replaced as necessary.  The air storage and distribution system must be inspected and repaired or replaced as necessary.  Any defects found in the chassis or support system must be repaired.  The tanks and associated pressurized portions will be tested after final repair by hydrostatic testing to ensure safe operation of the system.

By this, do you mean that the person performing the work must possess a U.S. Government security clearance (i.e., either Confidential, Secret or Top Secret) OR do you mean that the person must simply possess a demonstrated ability to see, handle, process and protect confidential and proprietary business information, but not possess a formal government security clearance?
 
Response:  the individual performing the work must have a current and valid clearance from a Federal Government agency.


(2)  Do you require the CONTRACTOR (i.e., the firm to which you make the award) to also have whatever the above qualification is, or is your requirement sufficiently satisfied if the person actually doing the work has it?     
 
Response:  Only the individual performing the work is required to have the specified qualifications and  clearance.

(3)  The solicitation states that the incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12, dated Aug. 4, 2006.

Department of Healt and Human Services
Subpart 353.2 ? Provisions and Clauses

Sec.
   352.202-1 	Definitions. ( Jan 2006)
   352.215-1 	Instructions to offerors--Competitive acquisition.
   352.215-70 	Late proposals and revisions. (Jan 2006)

(4) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.216-22, but it doesn't state an estimated level of effort for this indefinite quantity contract (so that adequate planning for dedicated staff can be made) or any minimum and maximum quantities.
 
Thus, what is the estimated number of labor hours contemplated by your requirement for a particular period (i.e., for the base year of seven months and for each of the two one-year options of twelve months each)?
 
Is there a minimum and maximum?

Response:   

The workload here is variable so setting the min/max would be difficult.  The contractor would have the ability to say he/she/they are too busy to take on a particular review assignment.  There may be other times when there is no work for a short period.  It depends on what documents are submitted to the Agency for review.  What we'd like to know from respondents is what they would propose as the hourly rate, which would be doing the work and what they would see as the level of effort along with any restrictions.  In the previous contracts,  16 hours per week was used as the proposed aggregate level of effort. 


Consequently, there is no definitive estimate available for the quantity of services to be performed under this contract.  Delivery and performance will be done at the direction of the Project Officer.  There is no minimum or maximum.  Once a contractor is selected, a purchase order specifying a not to exceed amount will be issued to the contractor.
 
(5) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.217-9.  There are several places in that clause for entries by the government.  
 
Can you advise as to what these entries should be in the clause's paras. (a) and (c)?
 
Response: (a)  30 days;  30 days:  (c) 2 years 7 months ( Base period of 7 months and 2 option years).

<DESC>Description
Amendment #02:
The purpose of this Amendment #02, is to answer contractor questions and extend the Quotation Due Date.  Solicitation Reminder: A contractor will have to provide awarded backpacks within 4 calendar days of being notified of Government need for each class.
The following questions and answers are hereby incorporated into the solicitation (and subsequent purchase order).

1.  Question:  When you refer to "bottom" is it the: 17.5" x 7",  13.5" x 7" or 17.5" x 13.5" side.  I visualize this bag as a small suit case,  with the bottom being 17.5" x 13.5"  and the cover or top  (17.5" x 7") with a zipper that goes up 13.5" over 17.5" and down  13.5".   The front face of the lid or cover would then have a zippered  pocket or pockets. (zipper would go approximately 17" across the top) with  dividers.  Your proposed design doesn't work well for a side  pocket

The bottom is 13 1/2" x 7" and the material is a large quilted design made of the same fabric as the backpack, unless using leather as the bottom, then contractor can offer a leather bottom and another durable material for the rest of the backpack.  Example of a one front pocket backpack would have a 10" zipper on the front with 7" depth pocket.

2. Question:  Does Class Number have to be embroidered on the backpack or can it be put on a patch which is embroidered on the backpack.
Answer:  No patch.  Class number has to be embroidered on backpack.

3.  Question: Can the back pack for this bid only have one front pocket?
Answer:  The backpack can have one or two front pockets.  The customer has no preference.

4.  Question:  Padded shoulder strap, should this be adjustable? In addition, how about a molded handle located close to the bag for easy lifting?
Answer:  The shoulder straps are padded and adjustable.  There should be a padded (molded) handle for lifting.

5.  Considering that this is a custom designed bag your delivery requirements of 4 days from receipt of order would be impossible to complete.  It would be possible to have a minimum amount in our inventory, and then have them embroidered with the logo and class number.  However, it would be difficult to embroider a thousand pieces and ship in 4 days. Can the delivery schedule be adjusted?
Answer:  No.  Note:  Solicitation does not require a shipment of 1,000 backpacks at one time.

6.  Question:  Once you lock in on the design, how much time can you give for the first delivery? We are a small company, less than 500 employees, and from the award, it would take a minimum of 5 ? 6 weeks to have completed product. Can this be accomplished?
Answer:  Although the closing Due Date has changed with this Amendment 02, start times for the first delivery is still February 1, 2007.  Again, please review the estimated amount of backpacks being sought per order/request per class.
7.  Question:  When offering a quote, is it necessary to ship a sample?  The solicitation infers this.  If a sample is required, can it ship without embroidered logo?
Answer:  Yes, a sample backpack is required with quote.  Sample backpack must have all requirements stated in solicitation.

8. Question:  Based upon what you consider the bottom, where will the embroidered logo go?
Answer:  Top of backpack, centered in the middle.  Suggestion: Seek out the middle of your backpack.  From the middle to the top of the backpack you would place the seal and class number.  

The quote/sample Due Date is changed to January 15, 2007, 2:30 p.m. local time.

<SUBJECT>58 -- UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas
<SOLNBR>H92222-07-R-0055
<RESPDATE>011207
<ARCHDATE>01272007
<CONTACT>Kathleen Henderson, Contract Specialist, Phone 813-281-0560 X304, Fax 813-281-2658, Email henderk@socom.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H92222-07-R-0055 is to post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows: 1.  The EDO DMC125 product is usually sold as a system, P/N SE78- 2-2.  The system consists of:  C125-2 antenna, tripod, case, and a 12 foot cable.  Does USSOCOM need the complete system?  Does USSOCOM require the 3 foot and 8 foot cable also or is this just for the Trivec-Avant (or Equal) items?
Response:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial off the shelf (COTS) items for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) High Gain Satellite Antennas.  For Contract Line Items (CLINs)  1001-5001, 1002-5002, 1003-5003, 1004-5004, 1005-5005, and 1006-5006, the Offerors shall propose their complete COTS system(s).  The purpose of the RF Coaxial Cable CLINs is for the Government to purchase different lengths of RF Coaxial cables as needed.  The Offerors are highly encouraged to propose RF Coaxial Cables (CLINs 1009-5009, 1010-5010, 1011-5011, 1012-5012, and 1013-5013) applicable to any proposed antenna(s).  The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the Offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.  2.  Please confirm the SATCOM radio interface connector is a type N female so that our BNC male to type N male cable will satisfy your requirement.  Response:  The SATCOM radio interface connector on the AN/PSC-5D radio is a BNC Female.    3.  The Statement of Work, Requirements, paragraph 2.5 refers to high and low angle modes for the AV 2091-2 (or equal).  The AV 2091-2 (or equal) is a single port antenna with right hand circular polarization minimum gain of +6 dBi at the zenith and incidental vertical/linear gain at other angles with no explicitly separate modes.  What is the intent of high and low angle modes for this antenna?  Response:  The intent of the high and low angle (elevation) modes for SATCOM on the Move (SOTM) is to identify the gain measurements for the antenna(s) in both angles given the proximity of the satellite to the radio.  When the satellite is close to or near to the horizon, the antenna performance will be less than if the satellite is at zenith.  The ability to operate a radio in different modes when the satellite is near the horizon may depend in part on several variables to include the gain to the antenna.

Will you please let me know what type of testing is required?
 
Meeting/Exceeding MIL-S-901 Testing, the vendor shall provide a certificate from an approved independent test activity verifying that the proposed lights, with installation kit, meet category Grade A, Class II, Type A
 
ANSWER: MIL-S-901D Grade A, Class II, Type A testing is required. The input from NMLC's technical expert is that if the candidate light weighs more than 550 pounds then they are required to do Medium Weight testing.  If their candidate light weighs less than 550 pounds then they are required to do Light Weight testing. Class II means that the U.S. Navy wants the light tested as it is mounted. Type A means that the light is the principal unit.  It is not a subassembly.  The Navy wants it to be considered mounted directly.  Not as a piece of something else attached to the overhead. The vendor is required to adhere to the MIL-S-901, as the MIL-S-901 has precedence over this amendment, this answer is the technical reviewer's interpretation of the specification. Vendor is advised to review the specification with regards to the 550 pound criteria.

Answer: The application is an all-fiber velocimeter (velocity measurement system) for impact and other dynamic tests.
2.  Question: Is a 5mm collimated ouput rather than the FC/APC termination acceptable? 
Answer: No, the laser must be coupled into a single mode fiber with appropriate termination (i.e., FC/APC or FC/PC) to fit the application.
3.  Question: What control commands are required through GPIB and RS232?
Answer:  Minimal commands are required: "on/off", "shutter on/off", and an intensity control should be sufficient.  An ability to modulate the input and detect/report the frequency is desirable but not required.
