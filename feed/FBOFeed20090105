Current qualified source is: Pratt &amp; Whitney (52661) IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.<br />It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other<br />restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Request for Written Quotation will be issued. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Perkin Elmer, of Shelton, Connecticut for the purchase of a Universal Reflectance Accessory as an upgrade for NIST’s existing Lambda 950 UV-Visible-NIR Spectrophotometer under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 b(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The NIST Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory requires a Universal Reflectance Accessory as an upgrade for its existing Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Visible-NIR Spectrophotometer.  

To cover the entire excitation range (185 nm to 3300 nm) of the existing Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Visible-NIR Spectrophotometer, NIST requires a Universal Reflectance Accessory which is a direct upgrade for the existing spectrophotometer.  This coverage of the entire excitation range will allow for overlap in data acquisition with previously acquired FTIR spectrometers as well as ellipsometers.  

The Universal Reflectance Accessory is designed to interchange directly with the other detector modules previously purchased for the Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Visible-NIR Spectrophotometer, and is automatically detected and controllable by the current software system.  The current software system will also perform automatic calibration and detector changes for the URA.

Perkin Elmer has developed this upgrade technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.    The existing equipment and technology are also proprietary to Perkin Elmer.  Perkin Elmer has no authorized distributors for this equipment.  Perkin Elmer is thus the sole provider of this upgrade.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on January 20, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Molecular Imaging Program, plans to procure on a sole source basis with MIMVista Corporation, 25200 Chagrin Blvd.; Suite 200, Cleveland, OH 44122 for a MIMVista Imaging Analysis and MIMContouring System.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511210 and the business size standard is $23M. The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1).  

The Molecular Imaging Program is dedicated to improving cancer therapy using novel imaging methods, and conducting extensive pre clinical and clinical trials in Building 10 on the Bethesda campus of NIH.  This involves the protocol-approved scanning of NCI patients in the Imaging Clinic located in B3B.  All such data is considered research and must be stored in a manner compatible with the research needs and statutory requirements of human research. An FDA approved device that stores the images and permits analysis of the images for research purposes, yet is fully compatible with the current imaging systems and other image processing workstations at NCI and NIH is a requirement. The MIMContouring system will include the software license and the required workstation, as well as software and support for a one year period. 
  

The system is composed of proprietary software and workstation. The MIMContouring system is the only software known that includes the ability to contour patient and animal data in 3 dimensions and save the contours as DICOM RT structure sets, ability to create contouring templates, ability to create user defined threshold-based volumes of interest, ability to contour PET volumes based on the count rate drop off at the edges and ability to export contour information to spreadsheet. The MIMVista system also performs mutilmodality registration as well as import and process data from the small animal imaging equipment. The computer system that is acquired with MIM Vista is customized to optimize the functionality of the program and is thus, vital to this acquisition. NCI has extensive experience with MIM Vista and are fully trained on this system based on its installation at NCI-Frederick, the Nuclear Medicine Department, NIH and the Cancer Imaging Program NCI.  Thus, the MIM Vista product will best meet the needs of this procurement.

Period of Performance:  Twelve (12) months upon date of award for upgrades and support.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST January 21, 2009.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist, at virtsa@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  

In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-90036-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure, via Government supplied drawing package, aircraft engine test systems for the purpose of intermediate level testing of turbo-shaft and turbo-prop aircraft engines in either indoor or outdoor environments. These systems will provide US Navy & Marine Corps intermediate maintenance level engine test capability for the H-60, AH-1, H-53, H-3, P3, C130, C2, and E2 aircraft families, and for the US Army: the CH-47, UH-60, and AH-64 aircraft. The engine test systems perform diagnostic troubleshooting along with the functional capability to analyze signals from the engine and fault isolate to the component level. The Navy owns the drawings and test software and will manage configuration.
The Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation system (SETI) and Turboprop Engine Test Instrumentation system (TPTI) interfaces with two major functional elements; the engine under test and the test system or facility. The SETI and TPTI will be operated worldwide at U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Air Stations. The basic system consists of the necessary hardware and software to acquire raw analog and digital engine data, perform signal conditioning and time averaging, perform specific engine performance calculations, and output the data results to a video display, printer and magnetic media. SETI / TPTI also controls the engine operation and ancillary test facility systems such as fuel, dynamometer, and engine lube cooling. Operator Control for this system is via a touch-screen personal computer based upon a Windows 2000 architecture. The single station control system serves more than one engine test program set (TPS). Only the TPS portion of the system will be unique for each engine test.

The major components of the SETI / TPTI  system will be manufactured / procured and installed by the prospective contractor into either a government supplied transportable instrumentation and control cab (ISO type) enclosure, or into a fixed test facility at a Navy aircraft maintenance facility. The major components of SETI / TPTI consist of a data acquisition cabinet, a terminal strip cabinet, the facility and test program set consoles for the operators (which contain the computers, monitors, and engine throttle controls), the electrical/mechanical junction boxes (external to the ISO cab) and the engine adapter assembly, which consists of the cabling and sensors for control and feedback from the engine.

The contractor will provide necessary systems engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the Statement of Work (SOW). 

The required basic quantity is estimated at two (2) Pilot Production Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T700 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T64 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Turbo Prop Engine Test Instrumentation (TETI) Unit, one (1) Pilot Production Model T-33 Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units for the US Army, and up to 48 Production Units. This procurement also includes technical data requirements.

After solicitation release, the government will provide an opportunity for interested offerors to visit a full-scale, mobile SETI engine test system at Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent River, MD. The dates for visits will be provided at solicitation release, and are being conducted in order to help offerors gain an understanding of the component interrelationships, and of the size and scope of this project. Visits will be by appointment only, and will be limited to one hour maximum. There is a limit of 4 persons maximum for each visit group. During the visit, equipment will be described and shown to all prospective companies individually, using the same generalized script. Any questions will be recorded and the answers provided to all offerors using the World Wide Web. All travel, labor, and other expenses incurred in the visit are the responsibility of the offeror. Offerors are not required to attend. 

The Government is anticipating an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Fixed Price type contract.  This procurement will be Full and Open.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select DOING BUSINESS and then OPEN SOLICITATIONS.  Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 1 February 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The tank presently is located in an area that is congested with other utilities and it is adjacent to a reinforced heated concrete entrance drive that is used by a portable MRI that is trucked to the Medical Unit weekly.  The edge of the heated pad may be affected by this project. The portable MRI arrives weekly on Wednesday night and leaves after work hours on Thursday. Construction can not interfere with medical center operations and access must be maintained at all times to the heated pad and roads. The present tank does meet DEQ requirements for containment and monitoring requirements of DEQ.  The new design and installation shall meet all EPA and DEQ laws.

<DESC>The CECOM Contracting Center-Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, intends to procure on a Sole Source basis spare parts for the First variant of the legacy Warfighter Information Network- Tactical (WIN-T) Increment (Inc) 1 Systems (Lots 1-9) from General Dynamics, C4 Systems, Taunton, Massachusetts. The proposed acquisition is for spare parts necessary to provide full and correct complement of initial spare parts to field WIN-T Inc 1 Systems and to sustain already fielded WIN-T 1 Systems down to the BCT level.  This requirement is only the first variant of the WIN-T Inc 1 System (Lots 1-9).  The WIN-T Inc 1 System is an automated communications networking system that provides Warfighters with voice, data, and video communications.  It consists of satellite-based Beyond-Line-Of-Sight communications equipment and network based equipment.  The WIN-T Inc 1 System provides tactical users with an interface to strategic data networks and commercial, Joint, Combined, and Coalition communications systems across multiple security levels, and Networking-at-the Halt.  The WIN-T Inc 1 System was formerly called the Joint Network Node-Network (JNN-N).  There are two variants of the WIN-T Inc 1 System.  The first variant is the legacy version. The second variant is the WIN-T Inc 1 System and is known as lot 10 and beyond. The total estimated price of the proposed action is $10.5M.    Below  is a listing of all the required spare parts.<BR><BR>NSN	                PART NUMBER	   DESCRIPTION	                      QTY<BR>5995-01-520-2170	09-2786649-1	   C/A,EL-POWER W504	              32 <BR>6150-01-534-4857	A3179773-1	   C/A,EL-POWER W500	              32 <BR>6150-01-552-4515	A3179608-1	   C/A,EL-POWER W752	              46 <BR>TBD	                A3179859-1	   TFOCA to TFOCA II adapter          32 <BR>7025-01-496-8996/ 	03-2730212-1 	   18IN FLAT PANEL DISPLAY            32 <BR>7025-01-515-5480<BR>TBD	                LT_TBALL_PS2	   KEYBOARD	                      32 <BR>5975-01-550-9590	MRV-LX4016S-101AC  TERMINAL SERVER	              32 <BR>5985-01-530-1202	A3179381-1	   ANTENNA ASSEMBLY-GPS	              32 <BR>5985-01-529-9929	03-2730173-15	   Antenna and 50 Ft Cable 	      32 <BR>5975-01-462-4980	36025900	   CHASSIS, 19IN RACK MOUNT-KIV-19    32 <BR>5895-01-516-9471	CARS-51-3	   ADC CAMPUS-RS PAIR GAIN MODEM      32 <BR>TBD	                A3179373-6	   PATCH PANEL,DATA	              33 <BR>TBD	                A3179373-7	   PATCH PANEL,DATA                   33 <BR>5998-01-520-2267	CARS-530	   RS-530 INTERFACE MODULE	      32 <BR>5985-01-530-4143	A3179386-1	   MAST ASSEMBLY-GPS	              32 <BR>5985-01-530-4184	A3179543-1	   Mast, Antenna 	              32 <BR>5895-01-554-1275	A3179866-1	   Configuration Panel Assembly, IA   32 <BR>TBD	                A3303447-02 	   Dynamic Line Shelf with AC power   32  <BR>                                           (includes A3303447-3,4, 5 and 13)	 <BR>5998-01-508-5763	A3303447-06 	   Dynamic Line Board (DLC) (Circuit  32<BR>                                           Card Assembly)	 <BR>TBD	                A3303447-07 	   DS1 boardset 	              33 <BR>5998-01-508-6216	A3303447-08 	   Universal Clock Synchronizer Board 33<BR>                                          (UCLK) (Circuit Card Assembly)	 <BR>5998-01-518-7869	A3303447-09 	   MF Sender Receiver (8MF)           33<BR>                                           (Circuit Card Assembly) <BR>TBD	                A3303447-10 	   Expanded Announcer Board (XDA)     33 <BR>TBD	                A3303447-11 	   PCMCIA Card for Data backup 	      32 <BR>5998-01-508-5777/ 	A3303447-12 	   Loop/Ground Start Ringdown         33<BR>5998-01-553-8441                           Trunk Board LSRD (Circuit Card Assy)<BR>TBD	                A3303517-03	   PLM Processor Front Card,          33<BR>                                           P400 R3.X1 (ref p/o -2)	    <BR>TBD                     A3303517-04	   PLMI Processor I/F, P400           33<BR>                                          (ref p/o -2)	                       <BR>5998-01-498-2516	A3303517-08	  Module, Primary Rate, NRDNT,        33<BR>                                          Screw	 <BR>TBD                     A3303517-11	  PV Secure, VDB, G.729, 12 CH	      33 <BR>TBD                     A3303517-12	  Module HSD-2B Dual EIA530 DCE,      33<BR>                                          Screw	 <BR>5998-01-498-1066        A3303517-15	  Module HSD-2B, CDP I/F, Screw	      32 <BR>5998-01-498-1019        A3303517-17	  Module, SA-EIA530/CD, NRDNT, SHLD   32 <BR>TBD                     A3303448-20	  Spare Power Supply, AC, 250W, P400  33 <BR>TBD                     A3303517-21	  Prime Voice Echo Canceller,         33<BR>                                          32 Channels	 <BR>5925-01-471-1495        29-2733502-2	  CIRCUIT BREAKER 	              32 <BR>5925-01-529-9825        29-2733524-3	  CIRCUIT BREAKER 	              34 <BR>5925-01-530-1230        IELHK11-33195-1	  CIRCUIT BREAKER 20A, 250 VAC 2P     33 <BR>TBD                     IELK1-33195-7	  CIRCUIT BREAKER 50A, 80 VAC 1P      32 <BR>TBD                     LELK1-33195-9	  CIRCUIT BREAKER 25A, 250 VAC 1P     32 <BR>TBD                     LELHK11-33195-2	  CIRCUIT BREAKER,100A 80VDC 2P       32 <BR>5995-01-499-4986        09-2730029-2	  CABLE ASSEMBLY                      32 <BR>5925-01-530-3418        IELK1-33195-5	  CIRCUIT BREAKER 10 AMP,80VDC 1P     32 <BR>4140-01-257-1863        57-2733512-1	  FAN                                 32 <BR>6150-01-554-0780        A3179779-1        C/A,EL-POWER                        32 <BR>5925-01-530-0754        29-2733550-4      CIRCUIT BREAKER	              32 <BR>5805-01-515-8480        CP-7940G          IP Phone                            58 <BR><BR><BR>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1-Only One Responsible Source, this acquisition will be conducted as a sole source.

<SUBJECT>D--Converting Teradata data warehouse to Oracle database, Request For Information
<SOLNBR>N0010409QQ295
<RESPDATE>020609
<ARCHDATE>03062009
<CONTACT>Apryl Gilbertapryl.gilbert@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIR 6.8.4), is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to identify potential vendors and to acquire enhanced knowledge and understanding of industry's capabilities and approach to migrating a Teradata Data Warehouse to an Oracle Database or an equal solution.   NAVAIR currently utilizes Teradata for the DECKPLATE Data Warehouse and Reporting System which contains  historical maintenance, flight, engine, and cost data for Naval Aviation.Teradata also serves as the Aviation Data Warehouse solution which is referenced in the COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2A, 15 Feb 2008.  When the decision to use Teradata was originally decided, it was based on several factors:  1)  DECKPLATE would need to be a Very Large Data Warehouse (VLDB) and the system would need to store 22tb of data.  That was over-estimated as we currently have a total of 3tb of data divided among three environments (development, test and production).  We have approximately 2000 tables. It is possible that we may double or triple our capacity in the next couple of years. 2)  The solution would need to provide near-real-time data and allow 100 plus concurrent queries.  Currently we have two Oracle interface systems that are updated several times a day.  3)  DECKPLATE would be a transactional system.  Currently DECKPLATE utilizes Oracle to provide a web front end for our transactional users.  This data is then transferred into the data warehouse for storage, retrieval and reporting.  4)  DECKPLATE would provide reporting capabilities in one place for our users.  DECKPLATE currently utilizes the COGNOS Business Intelligence (version 8.3) as our business intelligence tool.       NAVAIR envisions a solution that will convert Teradata V2R6.2 to Oracle Database 11G or like.  It would migrate and interface the COGNOS Business Intelligence tools and capabilities that we currently use with Teradata.  We would like to utilize our current IBM P590 Server or possibly upgrade to the IBM P595.  We would like to use a Windows Front End Server for our user interfaces.       Please respond with a formulated plan in Word or utilizing Microsoft Office.  Submission should be made to Apryl Gilbert at apryl.gilbert@navy.mil. No telephonic responses will be considered; if clarification of this Request For Information (RFI) is needed please email the address above.  Submitted information will not be returned.  This is not a request for proposal or quotation.  No solicitation document exists.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure these items, nor does the Navy  intend to award on the basis of the sources sought/market research or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI.

<DESC>Market Research for the Dry Support Bridge System (DSB)<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this market research.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the research questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3.  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Governments rights in the data.<BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<BR><BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market research and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market research will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>     The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Dry Support Bridge (DSB).  Appendix 1 shows the current DSB system specifications and Appendix 2 illustrates pictures of a DSB bridge and a DSB Launcher Vehicle.<BR><BR>     The current DSB provides the United States Army with an enhanced tactical bridging capability that replaces existing bridges currently in service with U.S. ground forces including the Medium Girder Bridge (MGB).  The system is a highly mobile, Palletized Load System truck-mounted (Government provided), rapidly emplaced, MLC 80 track / 100 Wheel capable, modular bridging system capable of spanning gaps up to 40 meters (40 meters is the minimum threshold requirement, 48 meters is objective).  The Trilateral Design and Test code for Military Bridging and Gap-crossing Equipment dated January 2005 defines what MLC requirements are and what testing is required to meet those requirements.  See the website for copies of this document.  The Government is presently in the process of proving the gap spanning capability of the present system to 46 meters.  The DSB currently consists of a bridge and a launcher.  The bridge is capable of spanning a 40-meter or less gap without the use of intermediate supports, piers, span junctions or reinforcement sets.  The launcher is capable of launching a bridge at sites where the near and far banks are of differing heights and slopes.  The launcher can retrieve the bridge from either end.<BR><BR>     The DSB is organic to corps-level Multi-Role Bridge Companies (MRBCs).  These units are typically placed in direct support of division operations or retained in general support of the corps/theater operations.  MRBCs normally operate under the command and control of the corps engineer.  Each MRBC will have sufficient equipment and personnel assets to emplace four bridges simultaneously.  The threat environment that the DSB operates in will vary dependent upon its location in area of operations.  The primary threat will be from indirect fire systems including conventional munitions, scatter able mines, Improved Conventional Munitions (ICM), Terminally Guided Munitions (TGM), and surface-to-surface missiles.  The DSB will also be a potential target for direct fire from fixed and rotary wing aircraft that have been sent to destroy friendly Lines of Communication (LOCs), or are transiting the area and attack the DSB as a target of opportunity.  Secondary threats will include direct fire from threat forces operating in and around our rear area and equipped with demolitions, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and a variety of small arms to include man-portable Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs).  The DSB is also a potential target for chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.<BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<BR><BR><BR>1.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE - ASHTABULA HARBOR SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have proposed a plan for harbor maintenance dredging in the lower Ashtabula River &amp; Outer Harbor in Ashtabula, Ohio. The project scope covers dredging of contaminated sediments, treatment, then transportation and Land Management at an approved location. The project may also include dredging of clean sediments with Open Lake Placement.<br /><br />The Ashtabula River is located in northeast Ohio on the southeast shores of Lake Erie. In 1985, the area was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission (IJC), characterizing it as an area with impaired beneficial uses. The impaired beneficial uses were derived in part from the presence of contaminated river sediment. A three year environmental clean-up project, ending in 2007, removed contaminated sediment from the river south of Sta. 120+00.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers now desires to perform maintenance dredging of the river mouth north of station 120+00 and in the outer harbor but certain parts of these areas maybe sufficiently contaminated so as to required environmental controls during dredging. Primary contaminants of concern in the lower Ashtabula River included low levels of numerous chlorinated organic compounds, in particular polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); and heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, lead, and zinc. The levels of these contaminants are all below Federal &amp; Ohio EPA regulatory levels but in certain areas may be above the levels that would permit Open Lake Placement.</p>
<p>A RECOMMENDED REMEDIAL PLAN INVOLVES: <br />1.) Mechanical dredging of approximately 200,000 cubic yards (in situ) of possible contaminated sediments from the river &amp; outer harbor, <br />2.) Treatment of contaminated sediments as necessary to meet disposition Facility requirements, <br />3.) Transporting to and disposition of the sediments for beneficial use as material for brownfields remediation, backfill material, landfill daily cover or other specific end use, and<br />4.) All sediments designated as non-contaminated will be deposited in the designated Astabula Harbor Open Lake Placement Zone.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SOUGHT: The intent of this Sources Sought Notice is the generation of information regarding potentially qualified parties capable of providing a comprehensive approach that utilizes the most effective and efficient means to manage the Ashtabula River &amp; Outer Harbor project sediments. This includes all transportation, logistical support and coordination necessary to meet the anticipated project schedule including transportation of sediment to the disposition facility, the acceptance of sediment shipments at the proposed facility, off-loading of sediments at the facility, and final disposition of the sediments. <br />USACE is interested in submissions related to one or more of the following possible contaminated sediment management alternatives:</p>
<p>1. Transportation to, and disposition of the project sediments in, a currently existing and appropriately permitted landfill facility as Daily Cover Material; <br />2. Transportation to, and disposition as backfill in a State Agency approved location;<br />3. Transportation to, and disposition of the project sediments in, an existing alternative Beneficial Re-use Facility proposed by the responder, subject to written regulatory agency approval.</p>
<p>Sediment management information submitted should be pertinent and specific to the subject project on each of the following qualifications:</p>
<p>1. Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed;<br />2. Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal team member or project officer; and<br />3. Asset Capability: Availability and description of special facilities or assets capable of accomplishing the technical objectives under consideration; and <br />4. Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to the specific objective that would enhance our understanding of the information submitted.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Firms having the capabilities to perform this work are invited to submit two (2) copies of an overview narrative intended to demonstrate their understanding of, and unique qualifications to successfully complete the subject project. This overview narrative shall include a list of relevant projects that the firm has worked on, the unique problems addressed on each project, and the firm's approach to addressing such problems. The proposed management method and location along with necessary regulatory agency approval must also be submitted.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</p>
<p>Submittals should be mailed to:</p>

This RFI is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3.  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining market information. No solicitation document exists at this time.

In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and response to this notice cannot be accepted as an offer.
1.  General
The U. S. Marine Corps (USMC) plans to assess strategic opportunities to optimize use of energy sources and technologies at Marine Corps installations within geographic, physical, technological, security, legal and market constraints at those installations. From this assessment, we want to create a template that can be used again for planning and developing energy and water reduction projects including projects that increase the utilization of renewable energy resources. We plan to have this review initially for Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in order to obtain a regionally oriented review. By strategic assessment, we intend this effort to address long term issues of energy supply, use, and cost to meet our need for reliable, available energy resources to support our on-going Marine Corps missions at these installations. This is necessarily expected to be a broader and longer term evaluation than is typically conducted in this area
2.  Statement of Need Statement (SON)
In order to better describe our energy strategic plan and template requirement and define our acquisition strategy, we are publishing this RFI as part of market research to learn and leverage best commercial practices.
For project planning and information gathering, the attached Statement of Need (SON) provides a scope and a set of tasks describing our current understanding of the type of study we desire to have done. We seek comment on the approach and desired outcome as well as information on similar studies and results performed for others that align with the apparent goals of the SON. Comments should address the SON from a view that an eventual awardee will be expected to offer a point of view and synthesize recommendations based on knowledge of energy technologies, markets and regional variables and constraints. These recommendations can be expected to guide energy decisions by the Marine Corps in the region for years to come. 
3.  Information Needed
All industry is invited to provide comments on this RFI. Information obtained from this RFI will be used within the USMC and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.
With regards to the attached SON, please provide comments/answers to the following:
a)  Identify a point of contact of someone who can address questions regarding the information you submit (Name, telephone, email, fax).
b)	Provide suggestions, comments, ideas regarding this process and the task areas identified in the draft SON.  We are particularly interested whether the identified task areas provide sufficient detail and information for you to develop a thorough and well-informed proposal.
c)	Provide, by task area, a capability statement that clearly supports how the industry in general, or your firm specifically, is capable of meeting the requirements in each task area. Provide examples of similar past work accomplished to meet identical or similar requirements in each task area.  Please describe the estimated annual and total cost for performing identical or similar requirements.   d)	If you are not capable of performing work in all task areas, how would you obtain the expertise needed to accomplish the work?  Which task areas would require additional expertise? 
e)	Discuss what if any areas of the SON you find vague or require further clarification. f)	Provide information on whether or not commercial services or, to the extent commercial services or items suitable to meet the USMC's needs are not available, nondevelopmental services or items, are available that could meet the USMC's requirements, could be modified to meet the USMC's requirements, or could meet the USMC's requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent.  4.  How to reply
Firms interested and/or experts desiring to furnish information should do so not later than 23 January 2009.  Responses to this RFI should not exceed twenty five (25) pages.  Both email and mail submissions will be accepted.  Vendors should clearly mark any information that is proprietary.  Please send email responses to predeen.aiyelawo@usmc.mil.  If you should have any questions, please send those to this same email address.  Mailed responses should be sent to:  Ms. Predeen Aiyelawo, Contracting Officer, USMC, Regional Contracting Office, NE, 2010 Henderson Road, Quantico, VA 22134.  Fax number: (703) 784-3592.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The Purchase Order will be made on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures and 13.501 (A) – Sole source acquisitions for the following services to be performed at American Association for Laboratory Accreditation. 
Statement of Work:
Assessment 
The objective of an assessment is to establish whether or not a laboratory complies with the accrediting body’s requirements for accreditation and can competently perform the types of tests or calibrations for which accreditation is sought. Accreditation is required to demonstrate compliance with additional criteria of AOAC Guidelines for Laboratories Performing Microbiological and Chemical Analyses of Food and Pharmaceuticals.
Pre-Site Visit
Once the application information is completed and the appropriate fees are paid, one or more assessors are assigned to conduct an assessment at the laboratory’s site. Assessors are selected on the basis of their testing or calibration expertise so as to be better able to provide guidance to the laboratories. Assessments may last from one to several days depending on the extent of the desired scope and the size of laboratory. Assessors are given an assessor guide and checklists to follow in performing an assessment. These documents are intended to ensure that assessments are conducted as uniformly and completely as possible among the assessors and from laboratory to laboratory.
Before the assessment is conducted, the assessor team requests copies of quality documentation and
representative technical SOPs in order to prepare for the assessment. The quality manual and related
documentation must be reviewed by the assessor team before the assessment can begin. This review is done
ideally before the assessment is scheduled. Upon review of submitted documentation, the assessor(s) will
provide the document review results to the laboratory in writing, and may ask the laboratory to implement
corrective action to fill any documentation gaps required by ISO/IEC 17025 before scheduling the assessment.
Prior to scheduling the full assessment, the assessor reviews the draft scope(s) to determine the tests to possibly witness and checks on the availability of the technical personnel who perform the tests. An assessment agenda is provided by the assessor.
On-Site Assessment
The full assessment involves:
• An entry briefing with laboratory management;
• Interviews with technical staff;
• Demonstration of selected tests or calibrations including, as applicable, tests or calibrations at
representative field locations;
• Examination of equipment and calibration records;
• Audit of the management system to verify that it is fully operational and that it conforms to all sections
of ISO/IEC 17025 and the AOAC requirements, including documentation;
• Evaluation of your laboratory’s compliance with the accrediting body’s requirements documents;
• A written report of assessor findings; and
• An exit briefing including the specific written identification of any deficiencies.
During the assessment, assessors may observe deficiencies. A deficiency is any nonconformity to accreditation requirements including:
• a laboratory’s inability to perform a test, type of test, or calibration for which it seeks accreditation;
• a laboratory’s management system does not conform to a clause or section of ISO/IEC 17025, is not
adequately documented, or is not completely implemented in accordance with that documentation; or
• a laboratory does not conform to any additional requirements of A2LA or specific fields of testing or
programs necessary to meet particular needs.
At the conclusion of an assessment, the assessor prepares a report of findings, identifying deficiencies which, in the assessor's judgment, the laboratory must resolve in order to be accredited. The assessor holds an exit briefing with top management of the laboratory, going over the findings and presenting the list of deficiencies (deficiency report). 
Laboratory’s Response to Deficiencies
The laboratory is requested to respond, in writing, detailing either its corrective action or why it does not believe that a deficiency exists. The corrective action response must include the laboratory’s root cause analysis and a copy of any objective evidence (e.g., calibration certificates, lab procedures, paid invoices, packaging slips and/or training records) to indicate that the corrective actions have been implemented/completed. It is entirely possible that the laboratory will disagree with the findings that one or more items are deficiencies. In that case, the laboratory is requested to explain in its response why it disagrees with the assessor.
Annual Review
Accreditation is granted for two years. For subsequent annual reviews occurring after the renewal of accreditation each laboratory must pay annual fees and submit updating information on its organization, facilities, key personnel and results of any proficiency testing. Objective evidence of completion of the internal audit and management review is also required. If the renewal laboratory does not promptly provide complete annual review documentation, significant changes to the facility or organization have occurred, or proficiency testing results have been consistently poor, a one-day surveillance visit and payment of the associated assessor fees is required.
American Association for Laboratory Accreditation has worked extensively in these areas and thus possesses an understanding of the procedures, problems and timeliness aspect to these projects.  Having the same Laboratory continue to do this will ensure that critical work is not interrupted and is completed in a manner that furthers the mission of FDA.  The proposed source is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  This action is proposed on a sole source basis because it is a follow-on contract where the University has developed procedures that help expedite critical requests and there being a substantial duplication of cost to the government. Any Interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met, no later than January 12, 2009.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be sent via email to Kimberly.davis@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC><p>The Office of Research and Analysis (ORA); of Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)&nbsp;shall make a sole source award to the committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) of the&nbsp;National Academy of Sciences (NAS).&nbsp;NAS will examine the potential strengths and limitations of using data from the America Community Survey (ASC) or other data sources to establish small area estimates (school district/school) of the percentage of households with&nbsp;school-aged children below the eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price meals.</p>
<p>The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally assisted meal program operating in over 101,000 public and non-profit private schools and residential child care institutions.&nbsp;School districts that participate in NSLP receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from USDA for each meal they serve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cash subsidies are much larger for those meals served to children certified for free or reduced-price meals.</p>
<p>Any child enrolled in a participating school may purchase a meal through the NSLP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level are eligible for free meals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Children from families with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty are eligible for reduced-price meals (no more than 40 cents).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Children from families with incomes over 185 percent of poverty pay for full-price (paid) meals at rates established by local school food authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 2007, more than 30.5 million children each day received a nutritionally balanced meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More than one-half of these meals were served to low-income children certified to receive free or reduced-price meals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Most students become certified for free or reduced-price meals based on applications submitted by their household to the school district.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The district uses self-reported information from the application about the household size, household income, and participation in certain means-tested public assistance programs - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP - formerly the Food Stamps Program), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Students may also become eligible for free meals through "direct certification" which allows districts to use information from agencies administering certain means-tested programs to establish that a student is a member of a household participating in one of these programs and is thus eligible to receive free meals.</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce paperwork and other administrative burdens at the local level, three alternative Provisions to the traditional eligibility determination and meal counts by type were enacted into law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Federal regulations for Provision 1, 2, and 3 are found in 7 CFR 245, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Determining Eligibility for Free and Reduced Price Meals and Free Milk in Schools. </em></p>
<p>Most schools using one of these special assistance alternatives use Provision 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Provision 2, schools operate a "base" year in which they serve all meals at no charge but use standard program procedures to establish individual students' free or reduced-price eligibility and count meals by eligibility category.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The schools receive Federal reimbursement based on these counts in each eligibility category.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In years 2-4 in a four-year cycle, schools make no new eligibility determinations and continue to serve all children meals at no cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The school takes only counts of the total number of reimbursable meals served each day, instead of counting meals by eligibility category.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reimbursement during these years is determined by applying the percentage of free, recued-price, and paid meals served during the base year to the total meal count for the claiming period in subsequent years.</p>
<p>In the early 1990's several pilot projects were conducted to test alternatives to the annual application and daily meal counting procedures in the NSLP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The intent of these projects was to test ways to reduce the administrative burden on schools with a large percentage of students from low-income families, while maintaining program integrity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Four of the pilot project sites operated no-fee programs, offering meals in some or all of their schools at no charge to all students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These school districts developed claiming percentages based on enrollment and applied these claiming rations to total daily meal counts to develop their claims for Federal reimbursement. The School District of Philadelphia was one of these pilot sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They developed enrollment-based claiming percentages by combining information about households directly certified for free meals and information from a socio-economic survey designed to determine if a household was eligible for free or reduced-price meals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Claiming percentages were established for all schools in the district and a no-fee program was implements in all schools in the district with 70 percent or more students eligible for free meals.</p>
<p>The FNS appreciates the challenges associated with collecting and reviewing free and reduced price meal applications, particularly in large school districts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is significant interest in alternative methods of developing claiming rates for reimbursement in the NSLP and SBP that are less burdensome to school districts than the customary method of applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FNS is amenable to exploring and evaluating other potential alternatives, including using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or other data sources to establish small area estimates (school district/school) of the percentage of households with school-aged children below the eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price meals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be extremely beneficial to have an alternate, independent, systematic, and reliable data source for school-level poverty measures.</p>
<p>Ideally, FNS would like to obtain a less burdensome alternative to applications processing that uses extant data to produce reliable annual estimates of the percentage of families with school-aged children and family income at or below 130 percent of poverty, between 130 and 185 percent of poverty, and over 185 percent of poverty for every school in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FNS would like to gain a better appreciation of the technical and operational issues associated with using a combination of data from existing surveys (e.g., the American Community Survey) and/or administrative records (e.g., number of directly certified students) that can provide direct estimates of sufficient reliability, timeliness, and quality for poverty estimates in small areas such as school districts, groups of schools, or individual schools.</p>

<SUBJECT>FEA Crack Software for Micro-mechanical Constraint Model Analysis
<SOLNBR>NRC-07-09-129
<RESPDATE>012009
<CONTACT>Sheila H. Bumpass, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014923484, Email Sheila.Bumpass@NRC.GOV
<DESC>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, proposes to award a sole source purchase order to Quest Reliability, LLC under the authority of FAR 13.13106-1(b)(1), for the purchase of the FEACrack code software and license. This particular software is needed to perform independent analysis of micro-mechanical constraint models used in fracture mechanics evaluations applied to reactor pressure vessels and other pressure-retaining components.   Acquisition of FEACrack will allow NRC to complete a comprehensive study of constraint effects on transition toughness to support recommendations on the appropriate treatment of these effects in utilizing toughness measurements made from different size specimens (i.e. Charpy, 1 T Compact-tension, 1T Single-edge notch bend, etc.) in reactor pressure vessel integrity assessment. FEACrack is also needed for required ongoing and future flaw evaluations.  FEACrack™ incorporates a unique variety of independently developed computational models and numerical methods that will enable a measure of reliability in analysis results not available from any other vendor.  The FEAcrack software was enhanced through the advanced FE analyses program (MRP-216) to allow the flaw growth behavior for an arbitrarily shaped surface and through-wall crack. For flaw evaluation, this ability greatly reduces the conservatism inherent in typical ASME Section XI flaw evaluations. FEACrack has the capability to perform pre- and post-processing of finite element analyses for fracture mechanics applications and has interface capability with such finite element packages as WARP3D and ASAQUS.   For structural applications, such as defect modeling in pressure vessels, FEACrack is the only program that can perform all of these functions. In addition, FEACrack has the capability to build, visualize and post process large finite element models of pressure vessels and piping that contain defects, and is specifically tailored to fracture mechanics analysis, unlike software packages that are geared toward general structural applications without embedded flaws.  FEACrack™ includes standard pressurized component geometries that can be automatically meshed with user-defined flaws for expedited analysis. For the NRC's collective requirements of constraint loss studies, flaw evaluations, pre- and post processing of finite element analyses for fracture mechanics applications, and efficient pressure vessel and piping model development, FEACrack™ is the only software known to be readily available. The use of finite element analysis within NRC is critical; the FEACrack™ program is being sought to satisfy problem areas where FEACrack™ is the only software with the capability to perform all required functions.  FEACrack™ is licensed exclusively by Quest Reliability.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe that they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation within 15 days after publication of this synopsis by emailing their capability statement to Sheila.Bumpass@NRC.gov.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NIST is not responsible for late delivery due to the added security measures. In addition, offerors/quoters who do not provide 24-hour notification in order to coordinate entrance to the NIST campus shall assume the risk of not being able to deliver offers/quotes on time. The Government is not responsible for the amount of time required to clear unannounced visitors, visitors without proper identification and without complete information that would allow delivery (i.e. point of contact, telephone POC, bldg., room number, etc.). If 24-hour notification was not provided, it is suggested your company representative or your courier service arrive at NIST at least 90 minutes prior to the closing time in order to process entry to the campus through the visitor center and complete delivery. Notice shall include the company name, name of the individual making the delivery, and the country of citizenship of the individual. For non-US citizens, the following additional information will be required: title, employer/sponsor, and address. Please ensure that the individual making the delivery brings photo identification, or they will be denied access to the facility. E-mailed quotes ARE acceptable. Faxed quotes will NOT be accepted. ***

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region.  The FS has recently produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.  The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. 

The FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan’s development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  The FTI engages the Government of Pakistan’s FS and Political Agents as well as the FATA’s tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region’s most immediate needs.  The FS and its representative Agency structures constitute the key interlocutors within the GOP for this program.  The FTI effort requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program will undertake media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The USAID Office of Transition Initiatives Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general and of the sub-region in particular.  Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including, but not limited to, community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights.  Excellent inter-personal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary.  Experience in contract/grant oversight is required.  Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and management of program operations in a conflict environment is preferred. 

The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments.  It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff performance and morale in a difficult work environment.  Strong team-building skills are essential.

The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI’s mission and global programs to in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials. 

The Country Representative will be based in Peshawar, Pakistan, and is the senior OTI representative in the country.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI’s mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.  The Country Representative’s principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Pakistan country program in FATA.  Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.  Depending on the situation, USG-provided housing in Peshawar may be shared with one other permanent USAID/OTI field staff. 

The Country Representative will:

•	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, Government of Pakistan Officials, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;

•	Serve as OTI’s primary liaison with USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other relevant agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with these varied stakeholders in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;

•	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the USAID Mission and U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and USG personnel in Peshawar, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;

•	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, various USG entities, and other donor organizations;

•	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of field-based OTI staff;

•	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;

•	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI’s implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) to ensure that activities are contributing to OTI’s program objectives and are within the partner’s scope;

•	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner’s scope to OTI’s country objectives, partner’s budgets, and modifications thereto;

•	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS;

•	Ensure that OTI’s programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

•	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

•	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;

•	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;

•	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the UN or host government, as appropriate;

•	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the USG personnel in Pakistan, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate. 

If required, travel to other or potential OTI field locations and/or Washington, DC to provide consultations on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The Country Representative will report to OTI’s Washington-based Team Leader for Asia Middle East, or his/her designee, as well as to the USAID/Pakistan Mission Director.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

While in Peshawar, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout Pakistan, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>Original Description</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation. The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning Metamaterials technology for Radio Frequency (RF) and Electro-Optical (EO) applications. Metamaterials are artificially structured material composites that have been engineered to alter their electromagnetic characteristics, such as index of refraction, or electric and magnetic polarization. These tools, if fully realized, point toward great increases in capability for both RF and optical applications, such as smaller antennas at reduced weight with additional functional bandwidth. Presently, metamaterials and associated technologies are pursued primarily at the basic research level because of the extensive scientific understanding required to utilize their unique properties in practical applications. Possible applications include RF antennas, filters, circulators, and frequency selective surfaces, Optical / IR beam steering, compact optical systems, mirrors, optical circuitry, interconnects, filters and limiters. <br />Technical POC: Dr. Bob Simpson, phone: (937) 255-3802 ext. 3475 e-mail: afrlryDX@wpafb.af.mill, Mail address: AFRL/RYD Attn: Dr. Bob Simpson 2241 Avionics Circle, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433.</p>

<DESC>MODIFICATION: "ALL OFFERORS ATTENDING THE SITE VISIT MUST BE U.S. CITIZENS."      The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure, via Government supplied drawing package, aircraft engine test systems for the purpose of intermediate level testing of turbo-shaft and turbo-prop aircraft engines in either indoor or outdoor environments. These systems will provide US Navy & Marine Corps intermediate maintenance level engine test capability for the H-60, AH-1, H-53, P3, C130, C2, and E2 aircraft families, and for the US Army: the CH-47, UH-60, and AH-64 aircraft. The engine test systems perform diagnostic troubleshooting along with the functional capability to analyze signals from the engine and fault isolate to the component level. The Navy owns the drawings and test software and will manage configuration.
The Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation system (SETI) and Turboprop Engine Test Instrumentation system (TPTI) interfaces with two major functional elements; the engine under test and the test system or facility. The SETI and TPTI will be operated worldwide at U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Air Stations. The basic system consists of the necessary hardware and software to acquire raw analog and digital engine data, perform signal conditioning and time averaging, perform specific engine performance calculations, and output the data results to a video display, printer and magnetic media. SETI / TPTI also controls the engine operation and ancillary test facility systems such as fuel, dynamometer, and engine lube cooling. Operator Control for this system is via a touch-screen personal computer based upon a Windows 2000 architecture. The single station control system serves more than one engine test program set (TPS). Only the TPS portion of the system will be unique for each engine test.

The major components of the SETI / TPTI  system will be manufactured / procured and installed by the prospective contractor into either a government supplied transportable instrumentation and control cab (ISO type) enclosure, or into a fixed test facility at a Navy aircraft maintenance facility. The major components of SETI / TPTI consist of a data acquisition cabinet, a terminal strip cabinet, the facility and test program set consoles for the operators (which contain the computers, monitors, and engine throttle controls), the electrical/mechanical junction boxes (external to the ISO cab) and the engine adapter assembly, which consists of the cabling and sensors for control and feedback from the engine.

The contractor will provide necessary systems engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the Statement of Work (SOW). 

The required basic quantity is estimated at two (2) Pilot Production Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T700 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T64 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Turbo Prop Engine Test Instrumentation (TETI) Unit, one (1) Pilot Production Model T-33 Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units for the US Army, and up to 48 Production Units. This procurement also includes technical data requirements.

After solicitation release, the government will provide an opportunity for interested offerors to visit a full-scale, mobile SETI engine test system at Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent River, MD. The dates for visits will be provided at solicitation release, and are being conducted in order to help offerors gain an understanding of the component interrelationships, and of the size and scope of this project. Visits will be by appointment only, and will be limited to one hour maximum. There is a limit of 4 persons maximum for each visit group. During the visit, equipment will be described and shown to all prospective companies individually, using the same generalized script. Any questions will be recorded and the answers provided to all offerors using the World Wide Web. All travel, labor, and other expenses incurred in the visit are the responsibility of the offeror. Offerors are not required to attend. 

The Government is anticipating an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Fixed Price type contract.  This procurement will be Full and Open.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select DOING BUSINESS and then OPEN SOLICITATIONS.  Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 1 February 2008. The point of contact is: Ms. Veronica Anderson, phone (732) 323-2800, facsimile: (732) 323-2359 or e-mail: Veronica.Anderson@navy.mil or Mr. Francis Hufnell, phone (732) 323-2902, facsimile: (732) 323-2359, e-mail: francis.hufnell@navy.mil.

<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center - Washington announces Amendment 0003 to Broad Agency<BR>Announcement (BAA) W909MY-07-C-0016, sponsored by the U. S. Army <BR>Communications-Electronics Command Research, Development and Engineering Center <BR>(CERDEC) Army Power Division, valid for Fiscal Years 2008-2010, unless sooner <BR>terminated.   This amendment is issued to delete and replace Topic 3: Hybrid Intelligent <BR>Power (HI-POWER) Management; delete Topic 4:  1KWE, JP-8 OR DF-2 FUELED, <BR>EXTERNAL COMBUSTION POWER SOURCE DEMONSTRATOR; and include <BR>Topic 5:  Thermoelectric devices for power sources in the 50-200 Watt range.<BR><BR>The revised Topic 3, Hybrid Intelligent Power Management Topic is as follows:<BR><BR>Topic 3:  HYBRID INTELLIGENT POWER (HI-POWER) MANAGEMENT<BR><BR>CERDEC Army Power Division is responsible for the applied research and development <BR>of power generation, energy storage, power electronics and distribution technologies that, <BR>when applied as a system, will support Army quality of life, field based operations, <BR>combat vehicles, weapons systems, surveillance techniques, and communication <BR>platforms.   One current area of interest is Intelligent/Adaptive Power Management on <BR>the Tactical Battlefield.  The Armys Hybrid Intelligent Power (HI-POWER) <BR>Management program was instituted to develop a general architecture capable of <BR>managing power more efficiently and effectively on the battlefield.  To enable the HI-<BR>POWER concept of a tactically mobile intelligent, adaptable power management system, <BR>additional reliable, high density power processing and power distribution equipment is <BR>required.  This hardware must enable paralleling of multiple power sources, plug and <BR>play connection of sources and loads, and seamless integration of AC and DC systems <BR>across a variety of frequencies and voltages.  The reactive and thermal management <BR>components of these power electronics and distribution systems drive the weight/volume <BR>of this new HI-POWER equipment.  Highly power dense Power Electronic Converters <BR>have been identified as the linchpin to enabling the HI-POWER architecture with <BR>tactically mobile power management equipment.  The objective of this effort is to support <BR>the Armys HI-POWER program through a series of studies and the design, development <BR>and proof-of-principle of Advanced Intelligent/Adaptive Power Electronics.   The long <BR>range objective of these efforts is to enable the Army to prepare a future performance <BR>specification that leverages the best available, cost-effective technologies as part of the <BR>System Design and Development (SDD) acquisition process for the HI-POWER <BR>program.  The technical solutions developed under this BAA will be evaluated in the <BR>Army HI-POWER test bed and may or may not be considered very specific spin-out (or <BR>spiral) insertion opportunities into the current Army power structure if deemed <BR>appropriate.  The Government expects multiple awards spread over multiple technologies <BR>as a result of this topic.  It is expected that each award will have a value of upto $ <BR>1,000,000 and a period of performance of between twelve (12) and eighteen (18) months.  <BR>This topic is focused on advanced research and development in two areas  an analysis of <BR>the advantages and disadvantages of AC or DC-based grids and improved power <BR>electronics.  The network architecture should be capable of handling up to 500 kW, at <BR>28V and 600V DC and AC at 120/240 V single phase and 120/208 V three phase and <BR>50/60 Hz. 1) Study of AC vs DC Systems:  This is primarily an analytical effort that <BR>assesses the advantages and disadvantages of AC or DC-based network architectures, in <BR>terms of size/weight (to include power generation, energy storage, and power distribution <BR>(to include cabling), reliability, redundancy, maintainability, deployability and the impact <BR>on voltage, frequency, stability and required protective devices.  2) Development of <BR>technologies which would reduce the size, weight, footprint, and noise of power <BR>processing equipment (power electronics) essential to the HI-POWER concept  while <BR>ensuring compatibility with military ruggedization, reliability, maintainability, and <BR>environmental requirements.  Technical barriers to be addressed include but are not <BR>limited to the items listed below.  These barriers must be considered together  one <BR>cannot be resolved at the expense of another. Performance must be improved, costs <BR>decreased, and size and weight reduced simultaneously  we do not want to sub-optimize <BR>the solution in favor or any single variable. (A)  Modularity.    Approaches to achieve <BR>optimal modularity are sought. Products, systems, or approaches developed under this <BR>BAA must consider the benefits and implications of modularity  as it is seen as a key <BR>performance metric in the eventual implementation of HI-POWER.  Power / Distribution <BR>solutions will need to be modular and readily adaptable to small (battalion), medium <BR>(brigade), and large (division) applications.  Modular approaches should reduce the <BR>proliferation of unique, stand-alone applications or end-items.  (B)  Cost.  Materials, <BR>processing, and fabrication technologies for power electronics and electric machinery are <BR>currently too costly. (C)  Volume and thermal management.  Todays power <BR>electronics are bulky and not packaged for tactical applications. Current thermal <BR>management techniques are inadequate to dissipate heat in high-power density systems.  <BR>Cost effective means of thermal management and heat transfer are sought.  (D) Weight. <BR>Current power electronics controllers/converters are too heavy and require additional <BR>structural weight for support thereby reducing mobility. (E)  Reliability and ruggedness. <BR>Power electronics modules that meet the requirements for size and weight are not rugged <BR>or reliable enough to operate in harsh tactical environments (e.g., extreme temperatures, <BR>humidity, sand/dirt). Also, the operating and shelf life of energy storage (or buss) <BR>capacitors is only 5 years under moderate conditions.<BR><BR>Topic 5:  Thermoelectric devices for power sources in the 50-200 Watt range is included <BR>in the BAA as follows:<BR><BR>Topic 5: Thermoelectric devices for power sources in the 50-200 Watt range.<BR><BR>The Army seeks to develop a thermoelectric power generation technology demonstrators <BR>using novel materials for battery, battery charging, co power generation and waste heat <BR>recovery applications. The thermoelectric demonstrators should be the basic component <BR>of a larger power source in the 50-200Watt range that can produce at least 12 Volts and <BR>can run on propane, butane, JP-8 or Diesel fuel. Various designs (e.g. segmentation and <BR>multiple stages) and novel materials should be investigated to achieve the most efficient <BR>design (at least 10% at the device level) for heat energy conversion to electrical. Best <BR>design and materials should be determined, from which the device can be built. It should <BR>be shown that the technology can lead to power densities of at least 20W/kg at the system <BR>level and can easily be combined together to develop the larger power source. At a <BR>minimum electrical and life tests should be completed on the device.  All proposals <BR>should include delivery of a minmum of two technology demonstrators for Government <BR>evaluation. The Government expects multiple awards spread over multiple technologies <BR>as a result of this topic.  It is expected that each award will have a value of up to <BR>$1,000,000 and a period of performance of between twelve (12) and eighteen (18) <BR>months.  POC:  Christopher Howells, 703-704-0234, christopher.howells@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Topics 1 and 2 of the basic BAA remain unchanged as a result of this amendment.  The <BR>complete BAA is available at the C-E LCMC Interactive Business Opportunities Page <BR>(IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/.  It is necessary for all potential offerors to <BR>access the IBOP to read the complete BAA, submission procedures, evaluation criteria <BR>and to submit whitepapers and proposals.   In order to access the BAA and submit a <BR>proposal a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS <BR>number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor <BR>employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registration.  The <BR>process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged <BR>to register as soon as possible. This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph <BR>6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which <BR>provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in <BR>response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are <BR>considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-<BR>369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Prospective offerors should note that <BR>this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make <BR>an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  <BR>The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable <BR>direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an <BR>allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-<BR>18.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment <BR>for the effort being acquired.  Potential offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted <BR>contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the <BR>expenditure of Government funds.  Any resultant contract award would include all <BR>clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements.  This <BR>BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the RDEC Army <BR>Power Division.  Specific information on program goals is provided in the following <BR>section, Program Description.  In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed <BR>effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at <BR>FAR 35.001.  This BAA is being evaluated using a two step process.  Prospective <BR>offerors will first submit a white paper for evaluation.  The purpose of the white paper is <BR>to preclude unwarranted effort and expense by potential offerors in preparing a full <BR>technical and cost proposal for efforts not considered responsive or for efforts deemed to <BR>have a low overall probability of obtaining support.  Submission of White Papers is <BR>mandatory prior to submission of a full proposal.  The selection of one or more proposals <BR>for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to <BR>include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in <BR>response to this announcement.  White Papers/Proposals shall be submitted in electronic <BR>format via the IBOP.  The IBOP submittal shall include an electronic signature by an <BR>individual having authority to enter into a contract.  There will be no formal request for <BR>proposal or any further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, <BR>interested parties should be alert for any amendments that may be published.   <BR>Amendments to this BAA will be issued through the IBOP at <BR>https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  It is therefore recommended that Offerors join the <BR>specific mailing list under BAA W909MY-07-R-0016.  Once registered on the solicitation specific mailing list a vendor will receive email notification of any updates relating to the BAA.  Offerors may submit questions related to this BAA electronically using the Question format available in the Army IBOP BAA Power Technology solicitation folder. Questions of a technical nature may be address to the project lead, specified below, until such time as a white paper has been submitted.  All questions of a contractual nature and all questions after white paper submission must be directed to the Contracting Office Point of Contacts specified at the IBOP.    ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT DUE TO UNANTICIPATED BUDGET FLUCTUATIONS, FUNDING IN ANY OR ALL AREAS CAN CHANGE WITH LITTLE OR NO NOTICE.

ITEM DESCRIPTION: MICROCIRCUIT, LINEAR

SOURCE CONTROL 

Documentation of Traceability

Products offered under this acquisition shall be in complete compliance with the item description on the schedule page and shall be new and unused, unless former Government surplus is evaluated and approved. 

If the offeror is not identified as an approved/qualified source in the item description, the offeror must submit traceability documentation to the Contracting Officer on or before the date that quotes/offers are due.  The documentation can be mailed, faxed or scanned and e-mailed.  The Contracting Officer may also require additional evidence prior to award to establish the identity of the item and its manufacturing source.  Failure to provide the required documentation within the stated timeframe may result in rejection of the offer.   

Traceability documentation must include the following at a minimum:
      
 (1)  If offered item(s) are "not in stock/not currently owned by the offeror" or "not yet manufactured":

The offeror must furnish a verifiable quotation from the approved/qualified source to the offeror.  The documentation must be on the approved/qualified source’s letterhead and include the approved/qualified source’s part number (or Mil Spec Type Designation), quantity sufficient to satisfy the solicitation requirement, date of quotation, and the offeror’s name and address.  
	
(2)  If offered item(s) are "shipped" or "in stock/currently owned by the offeror," the offeror must furnish one of the following documents: 
 
	(i)    A copy of the invoice; or  

            (ii)   A copy of the packing slip which accompanied shipment from approved/qualified source to offeror.  

The document must be dated and on the approved/qualified source’s letterhead and include the following elements:  name and address of approved/qualified source; the approved/qualified part number (or Mil Spec Type Designation); quantity sufficient to satisfy the solicitation requirement; and the offeror’s name and address.
	
(3)  In lieu of (1) or (2) above, if the offeror is an authorized dealer/distributor for an approved/qualified source:

The offeror must furnish a current authorized dealer/distributorship agreement on the approved/qualified source’s letterhead.  The agreement must specifically identify the exact item or a product line which clearly includes the item being procured.  If the agreement is not specific, the offeror must comply with (1) or (2) above.

(4)  If offeror intends to furnish parts from an approved/qualified source via distributor(s), the offeror is required to submit documentation establishing the line of ownership from the approved/qualified source to the offeror's possession.  This documentation establishing the link to the approved/qualified source shall be in accordance with (1) or (2) above.  

(5)  In addition, if MIL-M-38510, MIL-PRF-38534, MIL-PRF-38535, or MIL-PRF-19500 applies, and the items have been shipped to the offeror or are in the offeror’s stock, the offeror must provide the Contracting Officer a copy of the Certificate of Conformance required by the specification with their offer/quote.  Failure to do so may result in rejection of the offer.

Notwithstanding any documentation provided prior to contract award, the Government reserves the right to require additional documentation attesting to the authenticity of the material at any time before or after contract delivery.

If the solicitation indicates Inspection and Acceptance at Destination, the Government reserves the right to change to Inspection and Acceptance at Origin at time of award, and to incorporate DLAD clause 52.246-9004, Product Verification Testing.

The information required in (5) above is in addition to the requirements in the DLAD clause 52.246-9042, Documentation of Traceability - QPL/QML Integrated Circuits, Hybrid Microcircuits, and Semiconductor Devices.

This traceability requirement does not alleviate the requirements in DLAD provision 52.217-9002 – Conditions for Evaluation and Acceptance of Offers for Part Numbered Items. 

Requested information should be provided within three, (3) business days from the date of this request. Failure to provide the required documentation within the stated timeframe may result in rejection of the offer.
