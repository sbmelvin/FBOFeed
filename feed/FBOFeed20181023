At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined. Depending on the responses received from the market survey, the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), NAS Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award contract actions to General Atomics - Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), Poway, CA (Cage Code 0YJB5) for an additional twelve (12) months of Group 5 Unmanned Air System (UAS) / MQ-9 Reaper UAS Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) support for Task Force Southwest (TFSW) operations in the U.S Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Operations (AOR) during FY19-FY20.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government has existing contractor owned /contractor operated (CO/CO) MQ-9 Reapers providing ISR support to TFSW ground forces in the CENTCOM AOR. This procurement is to provide ongoing services of the existing ISR capabilities.</p>
<p>GA-ASI shall be responsible for transportation, operations, and maintenance activities in support of an Orbit capability of 16 hours x 7 days with surge to 24 hours x 1 day under a split operations approach with GA-ASI pilots and sensor operations in CONUS and GA-ASI Launch and Recovery crew and maintainers OCONUS. GA-GSI Group 5 UAS must include high resolution radar, multi-spectral imaging sensors, Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications and able to utilize the USAF Remote Split Operations (RSO) communications architecture for CONUS and OCONUS operations. GA-ASI shall also provide operations center elements CONUS and the integration of ISR products with the CENTCOM TFSW ground forces and USMC Joint Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (JPED) organizations.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action(s) are those for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>These contract efforts are in support of the TFSW/USMC Urgent Universal Need Statement (UUNS) #1722IUB, Task Force Southwest ISR Requirement - Group 5.</p>
<p>Only a GA-ASI provided MQ-9 UAS with its ground components can integrate seamlessly at the deployed location thus ensuring the following: a) certified interoperability with existing classified communications systems (both USAF and USMC ground force communication exchanges), b) spectrum compliance with other MQ-9 ongoing operations, c) compliance with JPED toolsets already being used with MQ-9 for multi-organization analysis d) compliance with base infrastructure optimized for MQ-9 UAS operations, e) have capital assets available for immediate deployment, f) have existing DoD Flight Clearance for CONUS and OCONUS operations, and g) integrate into the existing RSO infrastructure and be fully capable of performing ISR missions by June 2019 to avoid a gap in service.</p>
<p>Delaying the procurement to develop an alternative source for this urgent ISR surge is impractical and would prevent meeting the schedule requirements of the TFSW UUNS.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by E-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Mr. Sean McManus or Mrs. Dana Veitch using the contract information provided in this synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact General Atomics at GA-ASI-Small-Business@ga-asi.com.</p>

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing/repair knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition/repair of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights,manufacturing/repair knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Statement of Work 
OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this contract is to procure services for collecting and analyzing water samples for Legionella in accordance with VHA Directive 1061,  PREVENTION OF HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED LEGIONELLA DISEASE AND SCALD INJURY FROM POTABLE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS  and for collecting and analyzing water samples to verify compliance with  Infection Control Standards for VA Dental Clinics,  21 October 2013, and EPA Safe Drinking Water Act regulations in Dental Offices within the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. A summary of expected sample collection and analysis activities is attached as Attachment A.   VHA Directive 1061 is attached as Attachment B.  Infection Control Standards for VA Dental Clinics  is attached as Attachment C. 

SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES:

Legionella Sampling Requirements: 

General Procedures for Legionella Sampling: 

The contractor shall furnish all personnel, supervision, equipment, supplies, facilities, certifications, transportation, and resources necessary to perform Legionella water testing. The contractor must furnish all sample collection equipment. Containers must be sterile, appropriate for the analysis, properly preserved, and promptly transported to the laboratory under strict chain of custody procedures. 

The contractor shall collect and analyze water samples from distal points (sinks and showers) and ice or water from ice machines, cooling towers, and outdoor SCI fountain on Minneapolis VA Health Care System campuses included in the contract.  Specific distal point locations for sampling will be determined by the COR and/or the Health Care System Point of Contact. The numbers and types of samples to be collected and analyzed are specified in Attachment D.

Testing of the building s hot and cold water distribution system(s) for L. pneumophila must be performed quarterly (once per Federal Fiscal Year quarter, plus or minus 10 calendar days from the date of the last performance of regular quarterly service). Extensions may be granted for unforeseen conditions and for other factors outside of the contractor s control. 

Water samples must be taken from outlets on the hot water distribution system and outlets on the cold water distribution system from each building for each quarterly testing cycle.  NOTE:  Outlets  are the points in the water distribution system where the end user comes in contact with the water (e.g., faucet, showers, and ice machines).  Water samples will be taken at first  draw  to catch the water that comes out immediately from the outlet and will be at least 250 ml.  

At the time each water sample is taken, test (measure) and document the following for each sample: water temperature after it reaches a stable temperature, level of residual biocide (performing the proper testing for the site based on type of biocide), and pH.  This documentation needs to be provided with the analysis results. 

Non-routine sampling (outside of the quarterly sampling) may be conducted as needed.  The Minneapolis VA Health Care System is allowed non-routine samples numbering up to 10% of the total samples taken from each health care system annually.  If sampling over this amount is needed by healthcare systems, the contractor will provide a fixed price for the sampling equipment and analysis and for the collection of samples for each healthcare system.  The cost of this sampling will be added to the overall price of the contract.   

For non-routine sampling, the contractor must be able to sample within 24 hours of being notified of the need to sample. Samples of at least 1000 ml may be required. Water samples will be taken at first  draw  to catch the water that comes out immediately from the outlet.  Swab sampling may be conducted along with the water sampling for non-routine sampling. Swab sampling will be done in accordance with VHA direction and in accordance with direction from the laboratory where the samples will be analyzed. 

The specific sampling location and type of sample (e.g. hot water or cold water) will be specified by COR and/or Health Care System Point of Contact. Specific distal points sampled will vary per quarter, so communication with the Health Care System Point of Contact will be required before the round of sampling each quarter or before non-routine sampling in order to ensure that the contractor knows the locations of sampling. The locations of buildings included in the sampling are attached at Attachment D.  This list also includes the Health Care System Points of Contact information.

Sampling of cooling towers will be conducted two times per year during the period in which they are running at each of the locations included in Attachment E. 

Sample Collection, Storage, and Transferring of Analysis: 

Samples will be collected, stored, and transferred as directed by the COR or by the laboratory. For routine sampling, water samples need to be at 250 ml.  For non-routine sampling, water samples of at least 1000 ml may be required. Water samples will be taken at first  draw  to catch the water that comes out immediately from the outlet.  Each water sample shall be collected in a sterile, unused, HDPE or HDPP plastic leak-proof container provided by the testing laboratory. The following parameters will be measured and logged with each water sample that is collected: water temperature upon reaching a stable temperature, level of residual biocide, and pH. Samples will be stored and transferred for analysis in a manner that will maintain the integrity of the samples. Samples will be secured to prevent cross-contamination. Samples need to arrive at the testing laboratory within the time frame defined by the ELITE laboratory.   


Sample Analysis and Reporting:

The testing laboratory processing the water samples for Legionella must be certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Environmental Legionella Isolation Techniques Evaluation (ELITE) program as proficient at performing the culture of Legionella from environmental samples. The limit of detection must be < = 1 CFU/ml. The full 250 ml volume of potable water must be concentrated for routine quarterly testing.  The full 1000 ml volume of potable water must be concentrated for non-routine testing.  The testing laboratory must retain samples that test positive for Legionella for 30 calendar days and must release them to the healthcare system if requested.  Information about ELITE certified laboratories can be found at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/elite/Public/MemberList.aspx. The testing laboratory must also be able to determine if the Legionella detected in environmental samples is the species Legionella pneumophila and whether it is serogroup 1.  Quantify L. pneumophila and identify the presence or absence of other Legionella species.  Upon request, the laboratory must provide a detailed Standard Operating Procedures including all aspects of testing being performed to Minneapolis VA Health Care System staff. Upon request, the laboratory must also produce laboratory logs of testing results including documentation of positive and negative controls.

Provide all sample analysis reports via e-mail to COR and Health Care System Point of Contact. Notification of any positive sampling results will be made within two working days of making this determination. Analytical reports shall include a signed copy of the chain of custody, identification of sampling locations and conditions, including the specific outlet temperature of water at the time the sample was collected, pH, biocide residual levels, method detection limits, and a description of test methodology. Sample reports need to be provided in a format that can be copied into the VHA Legionella sampling results reporting form. Sample analysis reports must be provided within 15 calendar days of the lab receiving the samples. If the 15th day falls on a weekend or federally observed holiday, the reports shall be provided no later than the next normal business day.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY!</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary, and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.</p>
<p>This requirement is for designing, building, testing and demonstrating an energy-positive wastewater treatment/utilization system for Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The current and future demands of a highly mobile, resource-limited, Forward Operating Base (FOB) camp call for new advancements in technologies for wastewater treatment and reuse. The Government must continue to improve and optimize its water management to meet mission requirements. The need for reductions in the water supply burden of FOB operations and the safe discharge of wastewater require innovative technologies with the capability to treat black water (i.e., toilet, kitchen) so that it can be discharged into the environment, thus eliminating the need for waste hauling. TARDEC currently has the need to design, build and test a containerized black water treatment system in order to provide data for the future Army black water treatment system requirements.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to integrate solar, biological, electrochemical, and nano technologies to create and demonstrate a mobile, robust, and energy-positive wastewater treatment/utilization system for FOBs that can convert both blackwater and food wastes into clean water and renewable energy for on-site uses. The studied system shall include five unit operations: anaerobic digester of waste treatment, thermoelectric generator (TEG) of biogas utilization, electrocoagulation (EC) of water reclamation, reverse osmosis (RO) of potable water generation, and PV panel of back-up electricity generation. The integrated system overcomes the disadvantages of individual technologies such as incomplete wastewater treatment of anaerobic digestion, relatively high energy demand of EC and RO, low thermal efficiency of TEG, and heavy/expensive energy storage of solar energy. Even though the system has five unit operations, all of them are simple and robust unit operations, which require minimum maintenance and do not have moving parts. The success of the proposed project will deliver a truly self-sustaining, automatic, and robust wastewater treatment/utilization process, which will significantly enhance sustainability of FOBs.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts and supervises independent audits, investigations, and inspections of the programs and operations of DHS, and recommends ways for DHS to carry out its responsibilities in the most effective, efficient, and economical manner possible. We also seek to deter, identify and address fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and waste of taxpayer funds invested in Homeland Security.
<p>DHS OIG maintains fixed and replaceable assets at approximately thirty offices around the country, and supports approximately one thousand total individuals (contractors and employees). These assets include standard office equipment as well as specific IT (laptops, monitors, etc.) and law enforcement (firearms, ammo, vests, radios, etc.) gear. We are performing market research to identify IT solutions that would allow us to manage all of our assets in a single software package. The solution should be robust enough to cover all of our requirements for full lifecycle (acquisition through decommissioning) management, and should be tailored to the unique needs of law enforcement organizations. If available, we are looking for integrated solutions that include mandatory training tracking (e.g. quarterly qualifications, annual CPR, etc.) as well as basic fleet management. The OIG would like respondents provide a capability statement, also a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the specifications attached to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>1. PROJECT INTRODUCTION<br />Working with U.S. industry and international partners, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is leading the development of the first permanent cislunar outpost, known as the Gateway. The outpost will provide a platform to conduct long-term deep space operations, capability demonstrations to enable future exploration, and meaningful science on and around the Moon. The Gateway's core functions will include power and propulsion, communications, periodic crew habitation, robotics, an airlock, and logistics resupply capabilities. The logistics resupply capabilities are being procured by Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and will be the means by which services are provided for transporting cargo, equipment and consumables to and from the Gateway. Accordingly, KSC is hereby seeking information from interested parties to determine industry capabilities and to assist the Government in refining the acquisition strategy and requirements for providing Gateway Logistics Services via a Logistics Module. It is anticipated that the acquisition will draw on commercial space cargo servicing capabilities and launch vehicle services currently available in the market and under development. This SSN is only open to responses from U.S. companies. This upcoming procurement from NASA is for U.S. domestic provided logistics module services only. NASA is anticipating future international Gateway partners to contribute logistic services as well, with details to be worked out at a later date.
<p><br />2. GATEWAY LOGISTICS MODULE CAPABILITIES<br />The Logistics Module must deliver pressurized and/or unpressurized cargo to the Lunar Gateway located in a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) beginning no earlier than 2024 (dependent on development and/or launch of other Gateway modules). It is expected that the initial requirement will be for three missions, with a single mission expected to deliver up to 5 metric tons of pressurized cargo and 2.6 metric tons of unpressurized cargo. The first Logistics Module may be required to transport a Robotic Arm as unpressurized cargo. The Logistics Module must include guidance and navigation, power generation, and propulsion to enable autonomous docking to a port on the Utilization Module or Habitat Modules via an International Docking System Standard (IDSS) compliant docking port. Once docked, the module will be used by crew primarily for stowage volume, trash stowage, and trash disposal. In addition, the module will depart the Gateway and perform self-disposal without assistance after a period of no more than three years of cislunar space operations. It is anticipated that the first two logistics missions will launch the Logistics Module using commercial launch vehicles, but after Gateway assembly, the Space Launch System (SLS) may be available for co-manifested logistics delivery.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 481212, Nonscheduled Chartered Freight Air Transportation, with a size standard of 1,500 employees.</p>
<p>3. RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS<br />Interested companies having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above functions should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less describing their ability to provide the service described herein. In addition, NASA is seeking capabilities from all categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)/Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) for the purpose of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or Small Business and HBCU/MSI subcontracting goals for this requirement. It is not sufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information. Responses must include the following:</p>
<p>1) Company name, address<br />2) DUNS number and Cage Code<br />3) Number of employees<br />4) Number of years in business<br />5) Business size and category (Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone and HBCU/MSI)<br />6) Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime)<br />7) List of relevant work performed during the last five years to include contract numbers, if your firm was the prime or subcontractor, contract type, and dollar value of each contract or subcontract<br />8) Description of current capabilities and capabilities under development, to provide Gateway Logistics Services via a Logistics Module to include the commercial launch services.</p>
<p>In addition to the information above, responses should address the following:</p>
<p>1) Describe preference between an acquisition using contract by negotiations procedures (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15), commercial acquisition procedures (FAR Part 12) and one conducted via a broad agency announcement (BAA) (FAR Part 35) [i.e., Commercial Resupply Services-2 commercial approach versus the Gateway Power Propulsion Element BAA approach]. <br />2) Describe the effect on pricing if more than one contract is awarded. How many logistic missions are needed on contract to meet anticipated business case? <br />3) Should the Gateway Logistics Services be split into two separate acquisitions, one for the Logistics Module and one for the launch services? Why or why not? <br />4) Identify significant technical and cost drivers associated with providing the logistic service (e.g. target launch date, interoperability standards, human rating requirements, NASA standards, etc.). Are there any commercial approaches which may mitigate these concerns while maintaining the requisite level of Gateway safety? <br />5) Summarize the cost, schedule, and technical challenges associated with the Logistics Module performing functions in support of the other Gateway elements (e.g., providing and/or receiving power, attitude control, orbital adjustment, communications, environmental control/life support, etc.). <br />6) Are there any impacts in requiring an ability to manifest on multiple launch vehicles to include a co-manifested configuration on SLS?</p>
<p>4. GENERAL INFORMATION<br />This SSN is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a commitment by the Government to acquire any products or services nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSN.

The contractor shall provide a list of RDS units of the same model currently in operation in the US.

The system will be installed in light-duty, i.e. passenger cars and trucks, emissions test vehicles, usually more than one vehicle per day.  The RDS must typically run an over-night soaked vehicle and then be moved to a second soaked vehicle.  The vehicle soak period cannot be broken by a key-on or engine-on prior to running the test. The RDS shall remember a vehicle from previous learning so that the vehicle can maintain soak prior to the test without needing to key-on or start the engine. 

The RDS shall be capable of being installed into a vehicle by one person.  The weight of the installed piece(s) must not exceed 20 kg each.  Handles and grips appropriate to the size and weight of the installed pieces shall be provided.  The RDS shall fasten securely to the vehicle.  Total physical installation time into the vehicle should be 10 minutes or less with one person. The RDS shall have the capability to receive cycle start and drive cycle information from the test cell controller.  The RDS will send readiness and cycle complete messages to the test cell.  The RDS must be compatible with AVL Puma and Horiba CDTCS cell controllers. The RDS shall integrate with the test cell E-stop (emergency stop) so that the vehicle will come to a controlled stop when the RDS or test cell E-stop is activated.  A controlled stop may be configured in the RDS controller to include brake application prior to RDS shutdown. The RDS shall be capable of operating at temperatures between 10 F and 90 F.
	
The RDS will control the accelerator and brake pedals in an automatic transmission vehicle.  Options will include a PRNDL control and push button and key style vehicle starting capability.  The PRNDL control will allow the RDS to shift from Neutral into Drive at cycle start and back to Neutral at the end of the cycle.  The RDS will shift to and from Neutral only when the dynamometer rolls are stationary. The push button or key start actuator will allow the RDS to automatically turn on the vehicle at cycle start and turn it off at cycle end.  The E-stop shall also be configured to turn off the vehicle.

The RDS shall have an operator interface that allows the operator to select the vehicle and driving mode at a minimum.  The RDS will be able to learn a vehicles driving characteristics after driving at most 20 minutes on the dynamometer.  The RDS will retain this calibration in a user-named file so that the vehicle does not require another learning cycle. The RDS shall have the capability to adjust the driving style to meet the needs of the test program.  This would include parameters to control the trace following accuracy, throttle and brake activity, and level of feed-forward control. The RDS shall be capable of operating hybrid and battery electric vehicles.

Safeties shall be provided with each RDS to allow safe operation without an operator in the vehicle.  Examples of safeties would be software and hardware watchdogs that would detect improper software or hardware operation and then act to safely shut down the test.  Another example would be vehicle motion detectors that would safely shut down the test if the vehicle moved on the rolls (e.g. in case of a tire blow-out or restraint failure).  Fail-safes, for example, not shifting into Park when the vehicle speed is not zero should also be part of the RDS. The RDS shall have its own E-Stop button that safely shuts down the system and test cell in the event of an emergency.  The button shall be easily visible to an operator in the vehicle. 

The primary purpose for utilizing an RDS will be repeatability over the driving cycles.  Data shall be provided to show that these requirements are met over the US06 driving cycle:

EER_pct 2		<0.30
RMSSE_mph 2	<0.07
ASCR_pct 2	<0.60
IWR_pct 2		<1.00

These statistics shall be calculated using the definitions in SAE J2951 Drive Quality Evaluation for Chassis Dynamometer Testing

NARRATIVES SHALL BE NO LONGER THAN SEVEN (7) TOTAL PAGES.  Please include a narrative for the requested information and discuss any questions/concerns. Additional information such as brochures and other industry information is not included in the 7-page limitation.

<DESC><p>The purpose of IBCTPL Cutter Assessments is to conduct a thorough analysis of a vessel's watertight integrity and remaining service life of all watertight closures and Damage Control (DC) Fittings. Upon completion of the analysis, this program allows for repair and replacement of watertight closures and DC fittings which have been determined to pose a threat to operations, crew safety, and vessel watertight integrity. Furthermore, this program is designed to allow for water tight closure (WTC) and DC fitting repair training. Training, if elected, is to be provided to Damage Control Petty Officers (DCPOs) in order to strengthen and reinforce proper maintenance and repair procedures of WTC and DC fitting to improve safety and to reduce Coast Guard maintenance costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the intent of IBCTPL Cutter Assessments are to provide accurate and timely condition assessments, fault diagnostics and repair recommendations for the rotating machinery based on machinery condition assessment and monitoring technologies including but not limited to vibration analysis, performance data, information gathered from the ships' crews, reviews of maintenance data and visual inspections of machines. The objective is achieved by periodic testing and analysis of machinery by the contractor and the Ships' Forces with contract support. This will be a collaborative effort between the contractor and the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard may conduct some of the assessments independent of contractor efforts, however, during collaborative visits, contractors shall assume the lead roles, and the Coast Guard personnel will provide assistance as necessary.</p>
<p>Companies which would be interested in submitting a proposal for this requirement should reply to this sources sought notice noting their business size status such as large business, small business, HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Women Owned Small Business etc.... Further if there are no past performance evaluations on file in the Past Performance Information System Retrieval database, contractors should provide a couple past performance references including the following information: contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Replies should be sent by November 02, 2018, 11:00 am Pacific Time to: Karen.d.aldridge@uscg.mil</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving responses the Coast Guard will determine if this requirement will be set aside or unrestricted. After the determination a combined synopsis/solicitation will be posted on this website (https://www.fbo.gov/).</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 336611. The small business size standard is less than 1250 employees.</p>
<p>Contractors are reminded that in the case of a HUB Zone set-aside, FAR 52.219-3, "Notice of HUBZone Set-Aside or Sole Source Award" would apply which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small businesses. Contractors are also reminded that in the case of a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, "Notice of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside" would apply which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other service disabled veteran owned small businesses.</p>
<p>Additionally, regarding FAR 52.219-30 "Notice of Set A-Side For Women-Owned Small Business Concerns...": A women-owned small business (WOSB) concern eligible under the WOSB Program, means a small business concern that is at least 51 percent directly and unconditionally owned by, and the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by, one or more women who are citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice.</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers Walla Walla District is conducting this market research to gather pertinent information to help the contracting officer determine whether Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale electrical construction project (exceeding $25 million) at McNary Lock and Dam in the Pacific Northwest are appropriate. The McNary Main Unit Exciters, Digital Governors, and Powerhouse Controls Upgrade project includes replacement of the main unit generators excitation systems, installation of digital governors, and powerhouse controls upgrade. The powerhouse controls portion includes complete replacement and upgrade of powerhouse S-boards, control room SC-boards, auxiliary control systems, annunciators, and sequential events recorder (SER) systems. The S-boards and SC-panels will be replaced with a new layout that will include a network communication-based control systems with new HMIs for unit control, annunciation, and SER systems. Some systems will still be hardwired, for instance, manual synchronizing and breaker controls. The McNary Lock and Dam powerhouse is located on the Columbia River in Washington State.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to respond to this PLA Special Notice with the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide a list of recent (2-5 years) construction projects in the local labor market of the project under consideration. Include the following items:</p>
<p>Project Name/Location; Detailed Project Description; Initial Cost Estimate/Actual Final Cost; Was the project completed on time; Number of craft trades present on the project; PLA (Y/N); Were there any challenges experienced during the project (delays, investigations, health and safety issues, labor shortages, management/organizational issues, etc.)?</p>
<p>(2) Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. Are there other projects in the vicinity that could limit the pool of skilled labor available for this project?</p>
<p>(3) Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>(4)Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>(5) Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>(6) Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project?</p>
<p>(7) Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>(8) Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Interested parties must respond to this Special Notice no later than 12 November 2018. Mail, or E-mail your response to U.S. Army Engineer District Walla Walla, Attn: CENWW-CT/Ms. Hillary Morgan, 201 N. Third Avenue, Walla Walla, WA 99362; E-mail - Hillary.A.Morgan@usace.army.mil.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO Kimberly Seright, Contract Specialist, email kimberly.l.seright.civ@mail.mil.  ACC-RSA intends to award a new performance-based contract comprised of a one (1) year base period with four (4) additional one (1) year options with the option to extend services for six (6) months. This effort will be awarded as a sole source follow-on fixed priced and cost reimbursable hybrid contract to The Boeing Company, Defense, Space &amp; Security (hereinafter referred to as Boeing), 5000 E McDowell Road, Mesa, AZ 85215, Commercial and Government Entity, Cage Code 48T42 to support the Apache 64D/E Performance Based Logistics Services (PBL) Airframe components. The period of performance is from 1 May 2019 through 31 October 2024. To successfully provide the services required by the performance work statement the contractor and any associated subcontractor(s) must have access to the Apache Helicopter Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing's proprietary data in order to train and assist United States Government (USG) personnel in maintenance procedures.</p>
<p>The authority permitting other than full and open completion is 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c) (1); by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed acquisition requires the use of the cited statutory authority for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a. The proposed acquisition is limited to Boeing Defense, Space and Security, 5000 E McDowell Rd., Mesa, AZ (85215), Cage Code 48T42.</p>
<p>b. To provide to provide all equipment. material, labor, facilities, technical support and screening, performance tracking of hardware and software, to include technical publications and integrated electronic technical manuals, other logistical support resources and engineering services deemed necessary to support and sustain Apache Airframe PBL Components, aside from Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). Boeing as the OEM is the only source capable of providing the specific support required for Apache AH-64D/E Airframe Services.</p>
<p>c. As of this date no rights to the technical data have been acquired by the Government for a competitive procurement. Lacking a complete Technical Data Package (TDP), the Government cannot complete this requirement without the risk of a break in service and subsequent danger of severe non-availability of depot level logistics support for the Apache AH-64D/E Airframe Unique components. The data acquired thus far by the Government is insufficient to allow another source, commercial or otherwise, to perform on the program without the Government assuming tremendous risk to the validity of the available data.  Competition without an adequate commercial TDP would not be in the Government's best interest. As noted, Boeing as the OEM is the developer and sole manufacturer of the Apache Attack Helicopter and the only source that can provide access to required proprietary data/factory technical assistance in a timely manner.</p>

It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.).  Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System.  Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258.  A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.<br />In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;">COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION 1333ND18QNB640453</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Portable Benchtop X-Ray Diffractometer</div>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-99, effective 8/16/2018.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516, with a small business size standard of 1,000 Employees. This is a full and open competition procurement.</p>
<p>The Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Group (MMRG) of the Materials Measurement Science Division (MMSD) performs fundamental research, and develops metrology towards the compositional and morphological characterization of materials from the mesoscale to the atomic scale using electron, ion, and photon interactions with matter; detailed measurements, comprehensive analysis and modeling, and theoretical methods serve to advance microanalysis to address stakeholder needs in diverse areas of materials science.</p>
<p>A portable, benchtop X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) characterization tool will provide MMRG with a mobile platform for materials identification in support of other agency customer needs, and in the groups projects with everything from medical, to health and safety, to forensics science. Furthermore, the instrument will provide as an in-house reference instrument for comparative instruments used by law enforcement, and geological research customers where accurate materials identification are needed on remote or time critical drivers.</p>
<p>Therefore, to continue mission requirements MMRG must purchase a portable, benchtop X-Ray Diffractometer with an integrated sample changer. The XRD shall be mobility designed and the instrument chassis must meet safe radiation shielding guidelines, in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>The period of performance for the line item shall be in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Delivery of One (1) X-Ray Diffractometer, meeting all the specifications in accordance with the SOW, inclusive of F.O.B Destination, Shipping, and One (1) year Warranty.</p>
<p><br />Delivery</p>
<p>The XRD must be delivered within 120 days of the date of award. The items shall be shipped F.O.B Destination to:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />Building 301, Room B129<br />Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899</p>
<p>FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest priced, technically acceptable quotation.</p>
<p>Technically acceptable means that the Contractor provides a XRD, meeting the requirements in the SOW, and the requirements of the Line Item. If a Contractor does not indicate how its proposed instrument meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated to determine that the total price is consistent with the technical portion of the quotation and is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.</p>
<p>REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:</p>
<p>1.	For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Acceptability: Documentation including system requirements that confirms the contractor has demonstrated the ability to deliver the XRD instrument, specified in the statement of work. Contractors shall include a copy of the quoted system's manufacturers specifications.</p>
<p>2.	Contractors shall provide a Firm-Fixed price quotation for the XRD, to complete the requirements of the SOW. Pricing shall be as follows:</p>

<p>3.	A complete version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />4.	If the contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following." [Contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)].</p>
<p>It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the Contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order.</p>
<p>5.	Quoters shall provide an active DUNS# for the System for Award Management (SAM) registration. Quoters must have an active registration at www.SAM.Gov to be considered for award.</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement IS NOT being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).  If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation;</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)<br /><br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. <br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. <br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. 2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. 3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 &#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: <br />http://NOAASASHHelpline.org</p>
<p>&#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) &#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d) Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties. 3</p>
<p>(e) Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; 2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; 3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; 4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; 5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>

<p><br />NAM 1330-52.243-70, REQUESTS FOR EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT (OCT 2017)<br />(a) The amount of any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms shall accurately reflect the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the Government is liable. The request shall include only costs for performing the change. All indirect costs included in the request shall be properly allocable to the change in accordance with applicable acquisition regulations.</p>
<p>(b) Any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold shall bear, at the time of submission, the following certificate executed by an individual authorized to certify the request on behalf of the Contractor:<br />I certify that the request is made in good faith, and that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />_____________________________________________<br />(Official's Name)</p>
<p>_____________________________________________<br />(Title) <br />(c) The certification in paragraph (b) of this clause requires full disclosure of all relevant facts, including:<br />1.

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304, NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br /><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>SOLICITATION PROVISIONS</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Offer. Technically acceptable is defined as the offeror's ability to meet all the requirements/salient characteristics identified in the Statement of Work/Specification and the offeror's demonstrated ability to perform the contract successfully through Past Performance. Only the lowest priced offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If the lowest priced offer is found not to be technically acceptable, then the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated. This process will continue until a technically acceptable offer is identified; not all offers will be evaluated. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Technical, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price</p>
<p>(b) "Options." The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver.

<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.	The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within          business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i.	The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii.	The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii.	NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv.	Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5.	The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c)	Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&bull;	Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull;	Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull;	Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull;	Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d)	Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e)	Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1.	Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2.	Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3.	Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4.	Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5.	Suspension or debarment; or<br />6.	Other appropriate action.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-71 Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the is(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 5:00pm PST, Wednesday, 10/31/18.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract N00019-14-C-0070 procures Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) Services from Insitu, Inc., Bingen, WA. This modification will be to install Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) payloads on the Contractor Owned Contractor Operated (COCO) UAS aboard USS Lewis B. Puller. The specific requirement and GFE payload details are classified. The period of performance for the modification will be two months as a one-time installation activity associated with operational support within the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).
<p>Insitu, Inc. is the only source that can fulfill this requirement because substantial resources have already been invested in installing and integrating an Insitu Scan Eagle UAS aboard USS Lewis B. Puller and into the theater intelligence architecture. In addition, currently only the Scan Eagle unmanned aircraft system is able to support the unique GFE payload capabilities necessary to meet the requirements of the supported ship and other customers. <br />Unless otherwise stated herein, no formal request for proposal or additional written information is currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis is published for information purposes only. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS). <br />Subcontracting opportunities should be sought directly from Insitu, Inc. IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERESTED PARTIES: There are no commitments by the Government to issue any solicitations, make an award, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the efforts mentioned above. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. No telephone responses will be accepted. Point of contact for this synopsis is Victoria Heeren. Responses to this synopsis should be sent by email to victoria.heeren@navy.mil.</p>

The importance of price as a factor will increase as the Technical, Management Plan, and Past Performance evaluation Factors and Subfactors become closer in merit. There are three aspects to the Past Performance evaluation: recency, relevancy, and quality. Past Performance will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's present/past performance is recent, and relevant or not relevant to the requirement and how well the offeror performed on the prior contracts. The government reserves the right to award without discussions. If discussions are deemed necessary and are held, the Government may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.<br />Offerors wishing to submit a proposal are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP and for frequently monitoring the site for any amendments.

In addition to the above qualifications, special qualifications in the Department of Defense (DoD) include the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the DoD, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms including all small business socio-economic categories, and firms that have not had prior DoD contracts. The small business participation plan, as a secondary criterion, will not be applied by a pre-selection board, and will only be used by a selection board as a "tie-breaker" if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. The A-E selection procedures will be in accordance with FAR 36.6 A/E Services, DFARS 236.6, EP 715-1-7, PARC and local guidance. Interviews will be conducted for A-E firms identified by Selection Board and will be conducted in Baltimore, MD.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: The firm must demonstrate specialized experience in (a) the planning and design of pilot plants, and development of testing protocols for pilot programs to test and assess candidate advanced drinking water treatment processes; (b) bench and pilot testing of ozone, bio-filtration, ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, high rate clarification processes such as dissolved air flotation, and pipe loops for corrosion control; (c) assembling and procuring tailored pilot equipment to gauge process performance against specific treatment objectives; (d) integrating the equipment with appropriate onsite utilities, i.e., raw water, service water, electrical power, and sewer disposal; (e) interpretation of pilot scale studies to make full-scale plant design criteria; and finally, (f) operating new and existing pilot equipment for complex drinking water pilot programs, collecting and analyzing field data, working with external laboratories for analytical testing, and training of utility staff for operation of the pilot equipment. For this requirement, amongst other disciplines the Government will pay particular attention in the evaluation to the qualifications and experience of the project manager and lead disciplines for pilot plant planning, pilot start-up, operations and maintenance.</p>
<p>The firm must also demonstrate specialized experience in studies relating to plant-scale evaluations of advanced drinking water treatment technologies. Specifically, provide experience relating to the full-scale design of ozone, UV, and dissolved air flotation processes at WTPs with average daily production rates greater than 50 million gallons per day (MGD). Demonstrate experience with development of strategies for retrofitting existing conventional plants, hydraulic analyses, filter rehabilitation, disinfection benchmarking, corrosion potential studies, cost estimating, and optimization studies of water treatment plant and distribution system water quality. For this requirement, amongst other disciplines the Government will pay particular attention in the evaluation to the qualifications and experience of water treatment experts and senior water treatment plant designers in the areas of retrofitting existing plants for ozone, bio-filtration, ultra-violet disinfection and high clarification.</p>
<p>Qualified firms must demonstrate experience working with utilities and regulators to support compliance requirements and treatment process changes to include corrosion control treatment and disinfection. For this requirement, amongst other disciplines the Government will pay particular attention in the evaluation to the qualifications and experience of experts who have negotiated process changes with regulators to include impacts on corrosion control treatment and disinfection.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Professional Qualifications of the Individual Design Team Members: Offerors will be evaluated on professional qualifications and competence of the proposed personnel to provide services to accomplish the work required under this contract. The firm must have registered and licensed personnel, either in-house or through consultants, in the following list of disciplines: Project Manager, Civil Engineer, Environmental Engineer or Sanitary Engineer. In addition, supplemental assistance may be required in the following disciplines:<br />&bull; Mechanical Engineer<br />&bull; Electrical Engineer<br />&bull; Structural Engineer<br />&bull; Construction Manager<br />&bull; Cost Engineer/Estimator<br />&bull; Safety/ Occupational Health Engineer</p>
<p>The evaluation of proposed personnel will consider education, training, overall and relevant experience and longevity with the firm. The availability of an adequate number of personnel in the disciplines above shall be presented to ensure perform all aspects of the project including the continuous oversight of piloting operations as required. All personnel working under this contract must be U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Past Performance: Offerors will be evaluated based on past performance with similarly scoped projects with major water utilities in terms of work quality, innovation, compliance with schedules, cost control, overall safety record, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction. For each referenced project that demonstrates experience, the offeror shall provide the utility name and contact information, to include point of contact, title and telephone number. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified. In addition, an evaluation of past federal Government performance will be based on information provided through Contractor Performance Assessment Rating System (CPARS).</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Special Qualifications Required by the Government: Firms may provide additional information that will demonstrate their plan for program management, team organization including an organizational chart, professional registration, quality control, cost control, value engineering, management's approach to engage with and fully integrate in-house disciplines and consultants to ensure that pilot testing plans are in compliance with standards, codes, and construction practices, prior experience of the prime firm and any of their significant consultants on similar contracts with other municipal water treatment entities, and volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the DoD within the past 12 months.</p>
<p>*Secondary factors to be used as "tie-breakers" among firms that are essentially technically equal:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Small Business Participation Plan: Firms should demonstrate the extent of their participation with small businesses (including women-owned), small disadvantaged businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Geographic Proximity: Firms will be evaluated on their location with respect to Washington Aqueduct facilities located in Washington, DC since response time for pilot operation may be critical. If a new office is to be established, it must be set up and functional within six (6) months of the issuance of the contract. It is expected that some of the management and key personnel for the project will be physically located near the Washington Aqueduct.</p>

<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion). Criteria (a) through (f) are primary factors. Criteria (g) (h) and (i) are secondary factors and will only be used as "tie-breakers" among firms that are essentially technically equal.</p>
<p>(a) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence. Firms should demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in the following:</p>
<p>(1) Design for military construction (buildings and site work); <br />(2) Design of large, complex, and/or specialized facilities; <br />(3) Design of new and renovated structures for federal government facilities within defined cost limitations; <br />(4) Sustainable design, commissioning, and compliance with energy reduction mandates; <br />(5) General site engineering; <br />(6) Use/knowledge of MII for development of construction cost estimate;<br />(7) Use/knowledge of SPECSINTACT for specifications development; or <br />(8) Engineering investigations of building systems (e.g., structures, mechanical, electrical, fire protection).</p>
<p>Information contained in the SF 330 Part I, Section F will be the primary basis for evaluation against this criteria. Experience working on projects for USACE and New England District and in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria and the Whole Building Design Guide will be considered when evaluating these criteria. Projects in which the firm's work was completed prior to 2010 will be given less consideration.</p>
<p>(b) Professional Qualifications. Identification, qualifications, (professional registration/licensure/certification and education) and experience of architecture and engineering personnel to accomplish the work specified above.</p>
<p>(1) The firm shall have on staff (or provide through a consultant[s]) personnel licensed as professional engineer/architect in all six New England District states (ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, and RI). Should any task orders be issued for work in other portions of NAD's mission areas (NY, PA, NJ, DE, MD, VA, WV, and the District of Columbia), the firm will need to demonstrate applicable professional registration in those locations within the task order proposal. Should any survey work need to be accomplished under this contract, the firm must demonstrate in the task order proposal that its proposed survey team member is registered in the state where the work is to be performed. The firm should also have on staff (or provide through a consultant) a qualified value specialist to facilitate VE study workshops for projects valued at over $10 M as prescribed by ASTM and SAVE International standards.</p>
<p>(2) Resumes demonstrating experience and associated qualifications are required for the following key personnel. The evaluation will consider education, training, registration, certifications, longevity with the firm, and relevant experience of specified personnel performing the role for which they are proposed to be used on the contract. Key Personnel:</p>
<p>- Project Manager (3 resumes)*; <br />- Architect (2 resumes)*; <br />- Interior Designer*;<br />- Mechanical Engineer (HVAC)*;<br />- Mechanical Engineer (Plumbing)*;<br />- Fire Protection Engineer*;<br />- Electrical Engineer*;<br />- Building Commissioning Specialist;<br />- Cost Engineer;<br />- Civil/Site Engineer*;<br />- Structural Engineer*;<br />- Geotechnical Engineer*;<br />- CADD/BIM Manager/Specialist;<br />- Value Engineer; and<br />- Construction Scheduler. <br />* indicates professional registration is required. Project Manager can be registered as a professional engineer or registered architect.</p>
<p>(c) Work Management and Teaming. A proposed management plan shall be presented in Part I, Section H of the SF 330 that references the organization chart provided in Part I, Section D of the SF 330. The plan shall briefly address the firm's management and philosophical approach for executing the work to be performed under this contract and its approach for ensuring the quality of work performed by the firm and their subcontractors. The plan shall include information on quality control procedures, cost and schedule control, coordination of in-house disciplines and consultants, and relevant experience working with each of the subcontractors on similar projects. Section C, Section F, and Section G will be used to evaluate this criterion.</p>
<p>(d) Past Performance. The firm shall possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules as determined by information pulled from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and/or other sources. NOTE: PPIRS is the system in which the Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPARS) are stored.</p>
<p>The Government will retrieve and evaluate the CPARS reports, if available, for the first three projects provided in Section F of the SF330, as these projects should be the most relevant project examples provided. (NOTE: A CPARS report will not be available in PPIRS if the contractor has not yet completed its portion of the CPARS.) If the project/s is/are not a federal project or a CPARS report is not available, the firm shall complete Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire, send it to the customers for these three projects to complete Part II of the Past Performance Questionnaire, request the completed form in a sealed envelope from the customer and submit it in the sealed envelope with the SF330 submission. A blank Past Performance Questionnaire can be found attached to this synopsis/solicitation. The contractor should provide the full contract number and task order number (if applicable) for any Federal contract listed in Section F of the SF330. The evaluation board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from CPARS or if no Past Performance Questionnaire is provided. If little to no relevant past performance data (CPARS reports, Past Performance Questionnaires or information in Section H) is available for the three most relevant projects, the Contractor may be given a neutral evaluation regarding past performance.</p>
<p>(e) Capacity. The firm must demonstrate the capacity to execute the full value of the contract over the ordering period - accomplishing multiple task orders concurrently while maintaining quality and schedule. A firm will be evaluated on the available capacity of key personnel from the prime firm and its team; however, the prime firm must have the capacity to perform at least 51% of the work themselves over the life of the contract in order to meet or exceed the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting". The firm should address how it will meet this requirement based upon the assumption that the items listed under "Specialized Experience and Technical Competence" above constitute the preponderance of the work to be performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(f) Knowledge of the Locality. The board will evaluate the firm's knowledge and experience with state and local codes. Responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to support projects located throughout New England. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(g) Geographic Proximity. Location of the firm's office(s) as well as those of its team in the general geographical area of the six New England states will be considered.</p>
<p>(h) Small Business (SB) and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation. The firm shall identify its small business team members and indicate its commitments to utilizing small businesses on its team. The small business program includes utilization of SBs and SDBs to include Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). Extent of use will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort as determined by the Government, regardless of whether the small business concern is a prime contractor, sub-contractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation the greater the consideration.</p>
<p>(i) Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards. Firms shall indicate in Section H of the SF 330 the volume of DoD A-E contracts awarded to the prime (or JV) in the last 12 months. The information will be verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms. The equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among firms, including SB and SDB will be considered.</p>
<p>4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms able to perform this work must submit Parts I and II of the SF 330 for the prime firm (or joint venture). Part II of the SF 330 must also be submitted for each consultant and if a joint venture, for the joint venture entity. Please note that a separate Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract. If a joint venture is being utilized, a copy of the joint venture agreement is to be included in Part II.</p>
<p>Submissions must be made not later than the 5:00 pm on November 26, 2018.</p>
<p>Include the firm's DUNS number on the SF 330, Part 1, Block B. On the SF 330, Part 1, Block C, provide the DUNS number for each consultant. On the SF 330, Part I, Block F, example projects shall be listed in order of relevance to the type of work anticipated to be performed under this contract. Note that multiple projects performed under an IDIQ contract cannot be submitted as a single example project. In the SF 330, Part I, Block F, Box 24, provide the following information for each project: month/year the firm's work started and completed; total contract value of the contract and the value of the work performed by the firm and any team subcontractors to be used on this contract; physical size of the designed facility; construction cost as applicable; and customer point-of-contact who can be reached for references (phone number and email address). If a sample project is a federal procurement, include the applicable contract number. In the SF 330, Part I, Section H, provide the firm's proposed Work Management approach for this contract including its approach for ensuring the quality of work performed by its subcontractors - see also SELECTION CRITERIA, item (c). In the SF 330, Part I, Section H, the A-E firm may also provide supplemental information to address all aspects for which Specialized Experience and Technical Competence is being sought as well as documentation to support past performance selection criteria such as copies of applicable certificates and/or awards.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: Award will be made to the responsible vendor whose offer represents best value to the Government. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.

Factors Technical Capability and Current or Past Performance when combined are more important than Price. These factors are further described below:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability: The Offeror must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform the tasks described in Attachment 1 Supply Requirement while meeting the required delivery date of 21, December 2018.</p>
<p>2. Current or Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's record of current or past performance in work relevant to the type called for in the Supply Requirement.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC><div>The US Government has received the below questions and hereby provides answers to all interested parties</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q.2&nbsp; Regarding Attachment 3 Key Personnel - Is the Contract Administrator required to be bilingual, considering s/he will coordinate with the bilingual PM? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A.2&nbsp; We confirm that the contract administrator and key personnel that liaisons with the USG staff shall be bilingual.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />Q.3&nbsp; SOW 2.5 states, "For the Jerusalem Consulate General only - Designate representative(s) to provide guidance on income tax and national insurance codes, responsibilities, obligations, and prevailing practices. The assigned representative(s) shall speak English, Hebrew and Arabic..." Are personnel required to speak Arabic, or as listed in Section 3, Summary of Instructions, B.a.2 and Attachment 3, Key Personnel, only English and Hebrew?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A.3&nbsp; Command of Arabic is not required, i.e. will not be used as a qualifying factor.&nbsp; It may be a 'nice to have' item that facilitates communication between the contractor and the Consulate General's local staff.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3. B.a3: "Provide your document and PII security plans to show you understand and meet the requirements of FAR clauses 52.224-2 Privacy Act and 52.224-3 Privacy Training in Section 2 of this solicitation and of paragraph 6 of the SOW." Please clarify what document, in addition to the PII security plans, the bidders must provide.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A.4&nbsp; This is a misunderstanding.  The USG is referring to the offeror's security plan for documents <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> PII information.&nbsp; We regret the inconvenience</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br />Q.5&nbsp; Can bidders adjust the pricing sheet to conform to their DCAA accounting system as long as they provide the same level of detailed required by the original pricing sheet? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A.5&nbsp; We regret we cannot accommodate this request.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q.6&nbsp; What does the estimated start date of November 2018 in the solicitation refer to?</div>
<div><br />
<div>A.6&nbsp; The November estimated start date refers to the estimated date of contract award.   There will be a transition period between that date and the actual date the contractor takes over the payroll services.&nbsp; As per Section 3.B.b.1, a transition plan that addresses this period shall be included in offeror's proposal.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br />Q.7: Will the USG accept a timetable that implements actual payroll service at the end of calendar year 2019?</div>
<div><br />A.7&nbsp; A transition plan that addresses this period shall be included in offeror's proposal.   The US Government shall review all reasonable plans submitted.<br /><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q.8&nbsp; Does the relevant experience referred to in section 3.a.1 of the solicitation require experience in dealing with payroll services for an American company or entity operating in Israel?</div>
<div><br />A.8&nbsp; This refers to experience in handling payroll services for a major organization of a similar or greater size I the country of Israel.&nbsp; It does not specifically refer to an American firm working in Israel.  <br /><br /></div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The US Government hereby provides the following corrections and amendment to the original solicitation:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Section 1, SOW, paragraph 3.1 is corrected to refer to 'XLSX' payroll files</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Section 3,&nbsp;</div>
<div>A. Summary of Instructions, Section 3 B.b is corrected to 'includes all elements specified in paragraphs B.b.1 to B.b.3</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>B.a.1 is corrected to refer to payroll contract (instead of social media strategy).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Business Management Proposal is corrected to 'to include all elements specified in paragraphs B.b.1 to B.b.3 below'</div>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This Small Business Participation Plan is required to be submitted for evaluation of this factor.
The Contractor shall submit a detailed and complete statement for the Small Business Participation Plan.

(3) The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform;  
(4) The extent of utilization of Small Business firms on prior contracts;
(5) The evaluation will be based on the total contract dollar value, the contractors propose in terms of small business participation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (OCT 2014)
The Government will award a firm fixed price contract using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Award will be made based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.

  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
Addendum To FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (OCT 2014)
The Government intends to award without discussions however; the Government retains the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary. Offerors are urged to ensure that their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Failure to include all required documentation as required in this RFP, may result in your submission being found to be technically unacceptable and removed from further consideration. 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Offerors who fail to meet the technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. Each non-cost factor will be rated acceptable/unacceptable. To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved for technical and past performance.

FACTOR 1: Price Evaluation Approach
FACTOR 2: Technical Evaluation Approach: Granite & Marble Samples & Qualifications
SUB-FACTOR 1: Past Performance Evaluation Approach
SUB-FACTOR 2: Small Business Participation Plan Approach
SUB-FACTOR 3: VAAR Clause 852.219-74 Limitations on Subcontracting   Monitoring and Compliance (JUL 2018)

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors listed as shown below:
1.  PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price.  However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price proposals to ensure price reasonableness of the services or products being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.
The Government will evaluate proposals by adding the total of all line item prices for the base and all options.  Pricing may be compared against the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) or against the average mean of the offers received and may be used to set a competitive range if discussions are deemed necessary.
2.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.

a) Marble Sample(Acceptable/Unacceptable)

  Boring appropriately sized spaced

Qualifications: Personnel Experience:

SUB-FACTOR 1.  PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION APPROACH
Offeror shall provide no more than three, recent (within the last 5 years), and relevant Past Performance Questionnaires (Attachment C). Past Performance should be relevant in size, scope, and complexity. Offerors are required to demonstrate within the last five (5) years, successful performance under contracts (ongoing or completed) which are similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to the subject requirement.  Contact information provided with referrals shall be reachable by telephone or email.  If a referral cannot be reached, offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
 The Questionnaires (with top portion completed) shall be submitted in Volume II for (Past Performance).  Past performance will be evaluated for quality, timeliness (i.e. recent), problem resolution, business relations, customer service and relevance (i.e. experience in providing services similar in size, scope, and complexity as described in the SOW).  The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror s past performance. The Government reserves the right to determine the relevance of past performance information.  If no past performance information is readily available, the Offeror s past performance will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.

SUB-FACTOR 2.  SMALL BUISINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN APPROACH.
All contractors will be evaluated on the level of small business commitment they demonstrate for this acquisition. Work performed directly by a small business prime contractor will be evaluated as Small Business Participation. A Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is NOT required to subcontract out any portion of the work.  This factor gives the small businesses the opportunity to indicate that they will meet small business participation through self-performance, or, in addition to any subcontracting to small businesses.  
Quotes will be evaluated on the following basis of:   
(1) The extent to which Small Business firms are specifically identified in quotes;
(2) The extent of commitment to Small Business firms (enforceable commitments, such as established relationships, will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones);

Services are currently being provided under Program Executive Officer for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation's (PEO-STRI) Warfighter Focus contract (WFF), and five additional contracts. WFF expires in 2019 with no follow-on efforts planned.<br /><br />Attached to this posting are:<br /><br />- Government responses to Offeror questions based upon prior draft RFP documents and the Government's Pre-Solicitation Conference held in Hohenfels, Germany in late August.<br /><br />-&nbsp;A draft RFP package with solicitation, PWS, QASP, Performance Requirements Summary, plus 10 attachments and 10 exhibits.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Request for Proposals is anticipated to occur from 06-NOV-18 to 14-DEC-18. <br /><br />It is the Government's expectation that the attached draft package will very closely mirror the RFP package to be released 06-NOV-2018. The Government's intent in sharing this package early is to provide Offerors additional time to properly prepare proposals.

<DESC><div>Vendors interested in submitting a quotation in response to this pending Request for Quote (RFQ) are only required to have a GSA FSS contract on one of the following Schedule 70 SINs: 132 34 and/or 132 51.  All vendors, including those with only one of the SINs, will be requested to demonstrate their capability to meet the full requirements of the RFQ.  Vendors may choose at their discretion to enter into subcontracts, team arrangements, etc. in order to meet the full breadth of the RFQ's requirements.</div>
<div></div>
<div>***************************************************************</div>
<div>DOT is updating the special notice to provide industry with three tables to give additional details about the pending RFQ.  The attachment includes three tables which provide an overview of three groups of technologies that offerors should be able to address as part of their quotes. Table 1 represents DOT's current collection of technologies that support operational systems and require operations and maintenance support.  Table 2 represents a future state view of our notional technology stack that DOT hopes to leverage as part of our digital transformation strategy as it migrates away from some of the technologies listed in Table 1.  Table 3 is also a post-modernization view of the platforms DOT hopes to leverage as we rely less on custom software development to support mission needs.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>**************************************************************</div>
<div>The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) plans on soliciting a multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 70 in the next 30 days. The award will be a total small business set aside under the following SINs:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>SINs &amp; Title
<div>
<p>132 34: Maintenance of Software as a Service<br />132 51: Information Technology Professional Services</p>
<p>The scope of this department-wide BPA will encompass support for a suite of approximately 130 active applications.  It will also address new application development needs across a wide range of technology stacks.</p>
<p>To more rapidly deliver value to stakeholders, the USDOT is transitioning from a Waterfall development lifecycle to an Agile or DevOps approach. The agile approaches may include Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP) and DevOps. Many Operating Administrations (OA) within USDOT are moving toward selected agile practices in the development or maintenance of their applications.<br /> <br />This BPA will also support the Department's digital transformation program, DestinationsDIGITAL.  DestinationsDIGITAL is shifting the Department's technology deployment away from OA-specific point solutions that rely on custom software development to shared services and a narrower set of technology stacks.  These shared services include commercially-available, FedRAMP certified cloud services,  a set of low-code development platforms, a suite of centrally-provided enterprise IT shared services,  and a common suite of cyber security tools and services. Over time, the vision of DestinationsDIGITAL is to rationalize DOT's IT portfolio, resulting in fewer technology solutions to meet mission needs, thereby maximizing the value delivered by IT spend and reducing our cyber-attack plane.     <br /> <br />USDOT is seeking Contractors who have proven expertise in moving customer organizations from a waterfall environment to an agile software development and maintenance environment. Additionally, the resultant Contractors shall abide by DOT's Enterprise Program Management Review (EPMR) practices and procedures. These procedures govern project management activities for projects developed under both Waterfall and Agile methodologies. The resultant Contractors shall ensure that all application software is properly developed and maintained as well as performed in accordance with all applicable DOT IT policies and supporting operational guidance.</p>
<p>Contractors will be responsible for all layers of application development, including patching of middleware and developing/maintaining its configuration. Information Technology infrastructure is not included in the scope of this BPA as it is covered by the Enterprise IT Support Services (EITSS) RFP - https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=13229e9c0c7f0f678ef895fbb65902f1&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1. Additional services provided through the Integrated Program Support Services 2 (IPSS2) - DTOS5917A00014 - are also not in the scope of this contract.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that ten to fifteen small business agreements will be awarded under the proposed Request for Quotation (RFQ). USDOT plans to conduct a pre-proposal conference via webinar approximately two weeks after issuing the RFQ. This pre-proposal conference will ensure offerors have a complete understanding of the requirement before submitting proposals. The RFQ will provide the required information for Contractors planning to attend the event. Contractors other than small businesses are welcome to attend for subcontracting opportunities.</p>

<p>Tech Site Solutions has the knowledge, expertise and experience to provide a continuation of existing services without an interruption of the NIH Data Center support which includes electrical infrastructure design, maintenance and installation services for the Facilities/Infrastructure Services (FIS), Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH).

<p>The services provided by Tech Site Solutions are required as a continuation of services until a competitive small business award can be procured. The new competitive requirement is anticipated to be awarded during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Although this is not a request for competitive quotes, companies interested in the responding to this notice must submit a capability statement demonstrating their capabilities of working in a facility of a similar size and type equivalent to the NIH facility. Capability statements must be submitted and received by Friday, September 28, 2018 at 8:30 am.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 19-REG05.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may submit offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>This project will use the NOVEMBER and DECEMBER open period for submittal of offers.  You can enter information into the AAAP system at any time during the month but can only submit/activate offers during the open periods each month.  For this project the open periods will be November 1, 2018 to November 7, 2018 and December 1, 2018 to December 7, 2018 ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (24th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers.  Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with the requirements in this FBO advertisement and RLP 19-REG05 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease.  All documents can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<p>Information about the project:</p>
<p>Project Title: Project Number PA00106, Bechtel Elementary School</p>
<p>Project Location: Camp McTureous, Okinawa, Japan</p>
<p>Project NAICS: 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</p>
<p>Project Magnitude: Japanese Equivalent of Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000;</p>
<p>Project Description: This project will construct, through renovation and new addition, an elementary school with functional areas containing neighborhood instructional spaces, special education spaces, staff collaboration spaces, commons area, multipurpose room, information center, physical education, art room, music room, administration suite, health suite, guidance counseling suite, special education suite, food service, janitorial workroom, maintenance support, school supply/storage area, technology service center, and other required areas for a fully functioning elementary school. Typical construction for new building addition is to consist of special deep foundation systems, reinforced concrete and structural steel framing and reinforced concrete bearing and shear walls. Interior construction will consist of reinforced concrete interior bearing and shear-walls, gypsum wallboard partitions, and operable / movable partition walls. The project is to renovate approximately 6550 square meters of the existing school facilities and construct a new addition of approximately 7525 square meters. The project will require demolition of approximately 4200 square meters of existing facilities.<br />Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) principles for high performance and sustainable building requirements will be included in the design and construction of the project in accordance with federal laws and Executive Orders. Low Impact Development will be included in the design and construction of this project as appropriate.</p>
<p>This project will provide Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) features, including design for progressive collapse and blast-rated windows and doors, and comply with AT/FP regulations, and physical security mitigation in accordance with DoD Minimum Anti-Terrorism Standards for Buildings.</p>
<p>Project includes the construction within the school building of Designated Seismic Systems (DSS). DSS are those systems identified in the plans and specifications that must remain operable following a design earthquake. DSS have special requirements for certification(s) of the installed equipment of the DSS as well as Special Inspection requirements during construction. Project also includes other construction that requires Special Inspection of structural, architectural, electrical, and fire protection systems. Special Inspections are in addition to the standard Quality Control inspections required by the contract.<br />Facilities will be designed to provide cyber security engineering and validation as specified in DoD Unified Facilities Criteria.</p>
<p>Special foundation features are required due to poor near-surface subgrade soils capacity.<br />The project includes related infrastructure such as water, sewer, electrical, telephone, local area network, community access television systems, and provisions for interior and campus wireless access. The project includes site improvements such as site preparation, signage, fencing, paving, sidewalks, landscaping, exterior lighting, retaining walls, pedestrian bridges, canopies, covered walkways, play lots, play areas, outdoor learning, storm water, low impact development, and external AT/FP. Reconfigured parking area to include: staff and visitor parking areas, parent drop off lane, emergency/service access lanes, and loading/delivery areas.</p>
<p>The project will require hazardous material mitigation for all buildings to be demolished or renovated. U.S. Federal and Japan Environmental Laws and Regulations shall be followed. Asbestos containing materials and lead based paint are present in the existing facilities. The site is a known radon risk. Radon mitigation will be required.</p>
<p>The government anticipates the Period of Performance will be 42 months.</p>

<DESC>Event: Real Time Parts Tracking Industry Day
<p>Sponsor: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Business Operations Division (BOD)</p>
<p>Background: <br />The United States Coast Guard (USCG), ALC is conducting market research to determine feasibility of receiving commercial contractor-furnished resources for the procurement of real time parts tracking. The current system is not Windows 10 compatible and is downloaded to the network at the conclusion of the workday. It utilizes a barcode scanner that up to four (4) artisans are using daily. Parts movement needs to be tracked between the manufacturing and repair facility on base to the various product lines and warehouse. The proposed system must be able to wirelessly transmit parts movement and locations to a centralized Windows 10 compatible web based platform that will be accessible from 40 users daily. The network connection on base for wireless devices is Wi-Fi based, but we would be open to cellular access also that does not connect directly to the Coast Guard network. We prefer a barcode scanner system as opposed to Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) tags since our current parts inventory system utilizes barcoding.</p>
<p>To facilitate planning, ALC will host an Industry Day, November 7th, 2018. The location will be USCG, ALC, Heavy Maintenance Facility, Training Room 4. The Industry Day will consist of a review of the USCG's minimum requirements and a question and answer period. Each company will be given 30 minutes to present their product to the USCG one-on-one. Although the Industry Day (site visit) is not required, it is strongly encouraged. The event is part of ALC's market research that will be used to identify potential solutions to ultimately determine an optimal sourcing strategy. Contractors must register to attend this event. Interested parties shall submit the attached registration questionnaire no later than October 31, 2018. Base access will not be granted without this information. Directions to USCG Base Elizabeth City can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/alc/directions.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 488190 and the small business is $32.5M. Responses are due no later than October 31, 2018 and may be submitted via email to Christy.H.McKethan@uscg.mil. Questions concerning this Industry Day notification may be directed to Christy McKethan at Christy.H.McKethan@uscg.mil. Respondents are advised that the USCG will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Industry Day notification including participation.</p>
<p>Who Should Attend: <br />Attendance is limited to companies with demonstrated expertise in the design and installation of real time parts tracking. Prior federal contracting experience is not required.</p>
<p>Registration: Please limit the number of attendees from your company to two (2) people.</p>
<p>There is no cost to attend this event. There will be no refreshments served at this event.</p>
<p>Registration will close at October 31, 2018.</p>
<p>Day of Event: Onsite registration will begin at 0815. Please allow 15 minutes for security screening required to enter USCG Base Elizabeth City. This event is open to U.S. citizens and Green Card Holders. Government issued photo ID (i.e. driver's license) will be required for admittance.</p>

<DESC>Amendment to the Notice of Intent to Sole Source: Suicide Prevention Database

The Department of Veterans SAO West, Network Contracting Office 19, located at 6162 South Willow Drive Suite 300, Greenwood Village, CO 80111 intends to enter into a sole source, base plus four (4) Option year order authorized by FAR 13.106-1(b), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), the Department of Veterans Affairs intends to award a sole source purchase order to the small business, Previdence Corporation located at 5685 South 1475 East Suite B, Ogden, UT 84403.  The associated North America Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the Business Size Standard is $27.5 million.
The contractor shall provide the George E Whalen VA Medical Center in Salt Lake City, UT, with the Suicide Prevention Database required for online customer support 24/7, entering vital information relating to patients who are deemed high- risk based on their behavior and tracking patients for follow up calls, letters, appointments. The VA, specifically in the Veterans Integrated Services Networks 19 (VISN) locale has been using Previdence s suicide prevention program database since 2009. Utilizing the current system eliminates substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition in fulfilling the agencies requirements. 

It is VHA policy to standardize to the maximum extent possible the types and kinds of supplies and equipment it purchases, consistent with clinical and practitioner needs.  Utilizing Previdence s suicide prevention database allows for standardization expected to facilitate best-value product pricing, facilitation and delivery of high-quality health care to veterans.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government.
Interested persons may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday October 24th, 2018. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to meet the subject requirement. This information shall be provided at no cost or obligation to the Government.
The following option clauses have been added
52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)
  The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days.
(End of Clause)
52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)
  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 calendar days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
  (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
  (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 60 months.
