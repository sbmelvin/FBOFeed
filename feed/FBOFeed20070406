<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from the University of Utah (Dr. Joyce Mitchell), Salt Lake City, Utah on a sole source basis.

The professional services to be performed consist of the delivery of hours in support of the following tasks: (1) Consult with the Director of the LHNCBC to assist in the determination of new directions for evaluation and determination of future emphasis for content; (2) Provide expert consultant services for the Genetics Home Reference (GHR) team, including weekly video-conferences with the team members at the LHNCBC and regular communication with the Director of the LHNCBC; (3) Promotion of Genetics Home Reference in public discussions, scientific dissemination, and other opportunities. This includes both personal and team involvement with writing journal articles, poster presentations, seminars at professional meetings and discussions with consumer health groups or educational arenas; (4) Facilitate content development for the GHR team. This would involve mapping the content to be created, including the disease subtypes and the genes involved. This would also involve coordinating with team members on content development tasks and working with other genetics professionals involved in content creation; (5) Identify the next set of genetic conditions to include in the GHR and the medical genetics experts to assist in the content review; (6) Develop the next major thrusts of the GHR project as it relates to the health implications of the Human Genome Project; (7) Provide the liaison between the American College of Medical Genetics and the GHR project.

The period of performance shall be for a period of six (6) month.

The University of Utah has been a leader in informatics for over forty years. It is one of the few University settings with a specific link between the Medical Genetics Faculty and the Medical Informatics Program. Dr. Joyce Mitchell is a full professor at the University of Utah. Dr. Mitchell is a Board Certified Ph.D. Medical Geneticist (the American Board of Medical Genetics), a Founding Fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics, and also with extensive (25 years) experience in healthcare informatics.

Her extensive experience both with genetics issues in health care and with information system development, deployment and research makes her invaluable for this project. Her experience with the GHR project development during an 18-month IPA and a 12-month purchase order as a special expert consultant with the NLM also ensures that she is well acquainted with this specific project and its goals. Her knowledge of the NLM systems interconnected with GHR assured the continued rapid progress of the system. Her extensive background with strategic planning and system development will prove essential to the continued planning and deployment of the next phases of the GHR project.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services/Program Support Center has a requirement for the Office of the Secretary/Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.  The purpose of the contract is to conduct separate, parallel random assignment evaluations of the impact of (1) abstinence education curricula and (2) comprehensive sex education in multiple sites across the nation.  The overall evaluation will address two specific research questions:

•	Does abstinence education, delivered as part of a middle school curriculum, succeed in reducing sexual risk behavior?  
•	Does comprehensive sex education, delivered as a part of a middle school curriculum, succeed in reducing sexual risk behavior? 

Key outcomes will include:  reduction and prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.  Other key outcomes of interest include age at first sex, frequency of sexual intercourse, and the number of individuals who postpone sexual intercourse through adolescence.  The study will also estimate program effects on non-sexual risk-taking behaviors.

The impact evaluation will focus on the effects of these programs on a cohort of 6th graders who are followed through 12th grade.  ASPE estimates that the impact evaluation will span about 9 years.  The impact evaluation will rely on random assignment, with schools as the unit of randomization.  The overall study sample (for both the abstinence and comprehensive sex education studies) will consist of a cohort of 10,400 6th grade students, comprising initial samples of a minimum of 130 students in each of 80 study schools in districts that agree to participate.  It is anticipated that the 80 schools will be spread out across the nation in approximately five sites (urban, suburban, and rural) in five states.  It is anticipated that a nine year, cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded.  Additional design parameters and background documents can be obtained by sending an e-mail request to nicole.gardner-neblett@hhs.gov.  The solicitation is being competed on a full and open competition basis.  Solicitation number 07EASPE070024 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities (fedbizopps) website approximately 15 days after publication of this notice.  Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the fedbizopps website.  No telephone or faxed requests for the solicitation will be accepted.

			Gilbert Kaplan
			6090 Moongong Ct.
			Columbia, MD 21045-3820
	
        The contractor will provide technical assistance in extracting information about FDA?s field inspection and feed sampling activities and summarizing data on the occurrence of microbial, mycotoxin and pesticide contaminants in animal feeds.
The Center for Veterinary Medicine?s (CVM) Office of Surveillance and Compliance is responsible for planning and coordinating field inspection activities in general, and particularly for the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program.  Mr. Kaplan is the only known source possessing the knowledge, insight and experience to perform these tasks in an efficient manner.  First, Mr. Kaplan has performed these and related tasks for a number of years, and so will need no training on how to access and use information in the agency?s FACTS database, on the procedures used by the FDA Districts and Laboratories to collect and analyze feed samples for a number of contaminants, on the format and content of quarterly and yearly annual reports of data collected under the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program, and on the quality control procedures used by the Division of Animal Feeds to ensure that the data summarized in annual reports are accurate and complete.  Second, Mr. Kaplan has extensive knowledge and experience with the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program, and has participated in CVM?s recent revision of that program.  Third, Mr. Kaplan has knowledge and experience with the software used by the field to record the results of inspections, feed sampling, and laboratory analyses, and so can efficiently and effectively identify erroneous results that may need follow-up with Districts and/or individual inspectors.  Because of this experience and knowledge, Mr. Kaplan will need no training in ORA?s FACTS database, in the field?s sampling and laboratory analytical procedures for contaminants in animal feed, or in CVM?s feed compliance program; thus, Mr. Kaplan will be able to perform the identified work efficiently and effectively, and will be able to complete the identified tasks in the time allotted and at the budget for this contract. 
NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.

The medical services required are in support of all Shuttle launches and landings and attempts to launch and land.  The physicians that provide the required medical support services attend an Annual Orientation and Training Course & participate in several On-site Simulations each year.	 The University of Florida currently provides medical support services in support of the Space Shuttle Program under NASA, KSC Contract No. NAS10-02028.  This contract was competed and awarded in April of 2002.	The University of Florida is the only known source that can provide a sufficient number of trained physicians that can meet this NASA, KSC requirement for medical support services in the time frame required without the need to attend additional NASA, KSC Orientation and Training Courses or On-site Simulations.  This requirement is a follow-on effort to bridge the gap between the end of the Period of Performance of Contract No. NAS10-02028 until the anticipated award of a new KSC Medical & Environmental Support Contract (MESC) on October 1, 2008.  NASA, KSC posted a Synopsis on February 23, 2007 stating their anticipated plans to issue a draft Request for Proposal in June of 2007 for the acquisition of the KSC MESC.  For information as to KSC’s MESC, please go to the following website: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=123730    The Place of Performance is NASA, KSC.  The Period of Performance is April 25, 2007 through September 30, 2008*.   *Please note that the dates of Period of Performance are estimated dates.  The award may be on, before, or after April 25, 2007, thereby, affecting the beginning and ending dates of the Period of Performance indicated.

A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

MATERIALS:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

UNITIZATION:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 

UNITIZATION OF PALLET LOAD:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002, “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade”. Countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines are found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/swp/. Clause D-FSS-468 requires non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood packaging material used in shipments destined to IPPC compliant countries require the appropriate wood treatment. Additionally, shipments delivered to DOD distribution facilities or freight consolidation points for eventual delivery to or through EU/IPPC countries shall comply with applicable DLA Regulations and Procurement Letter PROCLTR 02-17.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to the Colorado Natural Heritage Program to conduct the Geospatial Environmental and Community Analysis in Pueblo and El Paso Counties of Colorado.  This analysis is to be conducted and documented in such a way that facilitates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses and permitting that are required for individual transportation projects.  The FHWA seeks to provide innovative analysis of regional environmental and community issues in a specific geographic area to demonstrate the potential benefits of such analysis and document a success story that others can use as models.  The FHWA has chose Pueblo and El Paso Counties in Colorado as the test bed for this analysis.  This effort is expected to adhere to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy of Users (SAFETEA-LU) consultation and mitigation provisions, FHWA Planning and Environmental Linkages initiative concepts and Colorado’s Department of Transportation Linking Planning and NEPA guidance.  The CNHP is uniquely qualified to conduct this requirement.  CNHP employs experts in ecology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology.  CHNP possesses a unique understanding of the ecological issues upon which is requirement hinges.  Therefore, CNHP is the only known source that can provide this service.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about April 20, 2007

<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE: This requirement is for the procurement of a qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the construction of a new Land Port of Entry in Calais, Maine. This project may include options, which will be evaluated as part of the award. Work includes but is not limited to site preparation, grading and paving; coordination of utility relocation; coordination of storm water management equipment, construction/coordination of multiple inspection booths and canopies; construction of approximately 60,000 GSF of new structures, including office/admin, violator detainment, shooting range, small laboratory, staff parking and warehouse spaces. The project will require coordination with the work of MDOT contractors at both the connection to the new International bridge and Route 1 connector road on opposite ends of the site.  This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is approximately 18 months.  The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on large cold climate construction projects. GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: Large cold-climate construction projects requiring the coordination of site work and blasting, paving and new construction of approximately $10 million dollars or more.  This project is designed using metric units and the magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $50,000,000. Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and, whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach, subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals. 

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range established in Phase 3. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing
Large construction projects in cold climate environments.
3 Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan and small business category goals.

<CONTACT>Olivia Adrian Contract Specialist 7037871151     Olivia.Adrian@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits capability statements of not more than twenty (20) pages in length, for the proposed study described herein. This pre-solicitation notice is being published in accordance with FAR 15.202, Advisory multi-step process that provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and invites potential Offerors to submit capability statement that allows the Government to advise the Offerors about their potential to be viable competitors.  This pre-solicitation notice includes information that must be submitted and the criteria that will be used in making the initial evaluation.  Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this pre-solicitation notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Please note that this requirement is subject to the availability of funds. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541620, "Environmental Consulting Services". BACKGROUND:  	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) and has also proposed new regional haze regulations to improve visibility.  The changes to these standards/regulations may require state agencies to perform air quality photochemical modeling for ozone and regional haze for use in their State Implementation Plans (SIPs).  In order to conduct this modeling, emission inventories must be generated as inputs to the models.  The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) specifies that states are to prepare emission inventories every three years, starting in 1996.  The collection and compilation of an air emissions inventory is one of the tasks that MMS conducts to assure coordination of air pollution control regulations between Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore sources and state's sources onshore (as per Section 328(b) of the 1990 CAAA).   The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is responsible for providing the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) emissions data from both stationary platform sources, as well as other non-platform sources, such as; exploration, construction, transportation, lightering, and supply vessels. Currently, the Gulf coast states air quality agencies and central/southeast states regional planning organizations use the MMS calendar year 2000 emission inventory for the offshore portion in air quality modeling and SIP development.  However, the year 2000 did not correspond to one of the onshore triennial periodic emissions inventory years (e.g., year 2002).  To correct this discrepancy and to update the 2000 emission inventory, the 2005 emissions inventory study was conducted.   Because of the widespread damage in the Gulf of Mexico by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita during the summer of 2005, the Year 2005 Gulfwide Emission Inventory is not complete, may be inaccurate, and is certainly atypical.    Both the 2000 and 2005 emission inventory efforts included using the Gulfwide Offshore Activities Data System (GOADS) software to collect, perform quality control, and archive activity data from platform sources that emit air pollutants.  The Database Management Software (DBMS) is an Oracle based tool that was developed to calculate and archive emissions data, using the most current AP-42 emissions factors and the activity data from GOADS.  In addition, Gulfwide activity data from OCS non-platform sources were collected for both these calendar studies and emissions were calculated.   The proposed 2008 Gulfwide emissions inventory will correspond with the next EPA onshore periodic emissions inventory.  Due to the more stringent NAAQS, it is likely that many of the regions adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico will face even greater challenges in attaining air quality standards in their respective states in 2008.  The year 2008 emissions inventory will be made available to assist states and regional planning organizations with modeling for additional SIP demonstrations to meet these challenges. Thus, the collection and compilation of an emissions inventory for OCS sources in 2008 is imperative, in that it provides MMS the essential tools to comply with the Congressional mandate:  coordinating air pollution control regulations between OCS offshore and states onshore sources.  Also, the inventory will be used to augment the MMS NEPA process by providing a more accurate inventory to compute emission trends and to perform necessary air quality impacts assessments. PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement for a study that shall provide a calendar year 2008 activity database and calculated emissions data for NAAQS criteria pollutants- carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter-10 (PM10), particulate matter-2.5 (PM2.5), all VOC, including exempted compounds (40 CFR 51.100), as well as greenhouse gases- carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20).  This emissions data is needed to support ozone and regional haze modeling, the NEPA process, and global climate change issues, over Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico OCS west of 87.5°W longitude.  Specific objectives of this study are to:  (1) review and recommend the modification of and provide support services for GOADS and DBMS, (2) collect, describe, quality check, quality assure, and archive activity data from all platform and non-platform sources over the OCS that emit air pollutants during one (1) calendar year (2008), (3) calculate the calendar year 2008 total emissions inventory using the most current AP-42 emissions factors for all specified platform and non-platform sources, and (4) to compare the emissions inventory with previously collected emissions data. STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS: Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality of the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, oil production platform equipment, non-platform air emissions sources on the OCS, conducting air emissions inventories, and EPA regulations and submittal procedures.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge of Visual Basic Windows and Oracle are needed to support the existing software used to gather platform activity data (GOADS-1) and calculate the total emissions (DBMS-1).  This knowledge should include programming to revise the existing software if necessary, plus understanding the programming languages and software to perform the necessary actions to calculate the high quality emission inventory.  Specific knowledge of MS-Access is needed to place the data in the needed format, or the EPA National Emissions Inventory Input Format (NIF).  This knowledge should be demonstrated through past successful projects similar in scope and size. SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations must submit a Capability Statement with 20-page that provides information about the organization's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed and evaluated by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. Following review and evaluation of all capability statements received from this announcement, a list of those deemed qualified to perform the work will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal and any logistical considerations.  Based on the review of the capability statements received in response to this RFI, the MMS reserves the right to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) HOW TO RESPOND:  Capability Statement, not more than twenty (20) pages in length: Two (2) paper copies: One (1) original signed copy and one (1) copy; and one (1) electronic diskette copy (CD MS/Word/PDF) submit to:  Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service Procurement Operations Branch MS 2500, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170  Attn: Ms. Olivia Adrian- 703-787-1151 (phone) and email at: olivia.adrian@mms.gov.

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:    1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.  2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are 	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check: (a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports. (b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).   (c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense. Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).   3.

Submit all items listed above under “business access.”  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor’s expense. 4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.  8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractor’s employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel. 9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.   Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if !  any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.   EVALUATION.

<SUBJECT>D -- NSSG APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND PROCESS SUPPORT
<SOLNBR>N00189-07-R-Z024
<CONTACT>Kathie Lockhart, Contract Negotiator, Phone 215-697-9612, Fax 215-697-9569, Email kathleen.lockhart@navy.mil - Brian Excell, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-697-9610, Fax 215-697-9569, Email brian.excell@navy.mil
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire services that will support Navy Systems Support Group (NSSG) under the Naval Sea Systems Command 04X2 and 04Z Directorates. NSSG is responsible for managing the Advanced Industrial Management (AIM) and Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair (SUPSHIP) Enterprise Programs respectively.  NSSG is responsible for the design, development, and implementation of streamlined business processes, new organizational structures, and enabling information technology to significantly improve the productivity, schedule performance, and customer satisfaction for work performed in maintenance depots.    The AIM software has been implemented in five naval shipyards and is currently being used to plan and execute projects in the four remaining shipyards (Norfolk naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval shipyard and IMF, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and Pearl Harbor Naval shipyard and IMF).  The suite of software tools are used to plan, schedule, execute and certify maintenance performed on Navy ships.  In addition to the core AIM software, several additional shipyard programs are part of the AIM suite of applications developed, maintained and enhanced by the Navy System Support Group (NSSG), e.g., Advanced Industrial Management - Xpress (AIMXp), Material Requirements (MRQT), Shipyard Metrics (SYMET), Technical Information Management (TIM), Ships Force Integration Systems (SFIS) and Project Sequencing and Scheduling (PSS). Several years ago the Material Access Technology (MAT) application was transferred to NSSG at the time of transition for one of the shipyards to a Mission Funded activity and development of Supervisor’s Desk (SUPDESK) and Shipyard Automated Budget Reporting System (SABRS) applications were transferred in 2006.  Several Depot Maintenance Systems (DMS), used throughout the Department of Defense, are also under the direct cognizance (acting for NAVSEA) of NSSG which currently includes Facilities Equipment Maintenance (FEM) and the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and other process and maintenance support for Program Managers, such as process improvement events related to the applications and the processes governing them. 
The Navy Systems Support Group (NSSG) is responsible for the AIM program, DMS and all associated applications, including process and software analysis, development, testing, field implementation, documentation, user training development, project team training and technical support. In an effort to ensure the continued successful operation of the NSSG, contractor support is required.
Six years ago AISC merged with NSSG, bringing with it responsibility for the following SUPSHIP IT systems: Navy Maintenance database (NMD), Momentum, Command Management System (CMS), Standard Procurement System (SPS) and the SUPSHIP Web Site.  Since then the AISC portion of NSSG has terminated Momentum and CMS and assumed responsibility for the following additional systems: Maintenance Resource System (MRS), Technical Support System (TSM), FEM for AFTAC and Validation, Screening, & Brokering (VSB)/Maintenance Figure of Merit (MFOM).
The SUPSHIP Automated Information Systems Center (AISC) portion of NSSG provides a single location for process analysis, design, development, and implementation of community-wide common systems and their associated information technology processes. The intent of the AISC is to significantly improve the productivity, schedule performance, and customer satisfaction for work performed in new construction and repair facilities through efficient and effective implementation of information technology tools.
The AISC is a full-service operations and development center for corporate application support to all SUPSHIP’s and many Private Shipyards/contractors, and Fleet Regional Maintenance Center (RMC) customers.  The AISC is responsible for supporting all aspects of the operations of these corporate production applications including but not limited to software development, maintenance, updates, testing, field implementation, documentation, training, functional and technical support, security review/accreditation, reporting and help desk operations. The AISC portion of NSSG will support the following listed applications and interfaces. The centrally operated SUPSHIP integrated enterprise is evolving with the addition of applications and interfaces, therefore this list does not limit the scope of operational support.  Navy Maintenance Database (NMD) with its Regional Maintenance Automated Information System (RMAIS); Technical Support Management system; DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS); Maintenance Resource System; Validation, Screening and Brokering system; Corporate system interfaces; SUPSHIP enterprise internet, intranet, and extranet web sites and web-based application deployment environments. 
NSSG (and the AISC portion of it) requires the contractor to provide support in the performance a host of activities to ensure the successful development, deployment, implementation and operation of the Navy and DOD Maintenance community software tools managed by the activity.  The contractor shall provide support in the following areas: Software Development and Implementation; Production Hosting; Process, Analysis and Training; Testing, Certification, and documentation.  All support shall be in accordance with standard practices, policies and procedures as defined by NSSG and SUPSHIP.

It is intended to award a single cost plus fixed fee, indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery type contract.  The anticipated contract is for a base 12 month period with four one year option periods.  The total estimated man-hours for this effort (inclusive of options) is 2,704,750.  The applicable FSC is D302 and the NAICS is 541511.  It is anticipated that services would begin 1 Jan 2008 or date of award whichever is later. 

The solicitation will require the submission of cost/price and technical proposals.  The Navy’s evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror’s technical proposal more important than the offeror’s price proposal.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Division. Upon its release the solicitation will be issued electronically and will be posted at Navy Electronic Commerce OnLine and can be found at www.neco.navy.mil.   It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released o/a 15 June 2007.  The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting white papers and full proposals describing innovative technology concepts to provide Terminal Swimmer Detection and Targeting.  Concepts are required to reacquire, localize, and confirm the classification of a target that has been detected and classified as a possible swimmer or diver by an early warning system.  The environment of interest is primarily permanent Naval installations but could include commercial ports and anchorages in world wide locations.  The targets include free swimmers, open and closed circuit divers, and divers aided by Diver Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs).  Concepts may range from sensor technologies suitable for manned and unmanned vehicles to complete sensor, delivery, and communication systems that would enable a remote operator to investigate contacts in real time without the aid of manned watercraft.  The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts in a realistic environment.  The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2008 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2010 or earlier.  See attachment (BAA) for full description.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Automated Letter Movement System (ALMS)
Modification 3 to the
FBO’s Posting


USPS Responses to questions that have been raised concerning the ALMS:

1. Question: Can you characterize the number of letters or size of "stacks" that are released from the AFCSs.... (On average, how many letters fit into each of the accumulation hopper - and what dimension is that group of letters (IE: 375 letters fit in 18" x 12")?
USPS Response: Letters range in size within the following limits:
Height - 3.5 to 6.125 inched
Length - 5 to 11.5 inched
Thickness - .007 to .3125 inches
On average 500 to 600 letter will fit into a 2 foot tray. (Note – The intent of this program is to eliminate the need to put letters into trays at the AFCS.)


2. Question: The output of the AFCS is faster than the DBCSs  (32k throughput AFCS vs. 40k for a DBCS; however, two (2) AFCSs (64k can flood a single DBCS 60k if Murphy shows up and the 51% Local mail hits concurrently on both AFCSs)  Then one of the AFCS machines will have to shut down or divert.  Are there any requirements for how the proto-type system would handle this?  As well as when a DBCS goes down?
USPS Response: The potential suppliers need to propose a solution to this problem in their white papers on their propose systems. 

3. Question: With the thought that there would be (2) AFCSs feeding (1) or (2) DBCSs....  How would the system deal with the (3) types of mail... Running 2 into 2 would you load only 2 types (Local and FIM for example) into both AFCS units and the ALMS would then need to take the (2) mixed inputs and feed to both DBCS output types (1) DBCS for FIM and (1) for Local?
USPS Response: The 2-to-1 or 2-to-2 configuration is only intended to be a proof of concept, not a final solution.

The Government previously intended to issue this RFP o/a March 19, 2007 with an estimated proposal due date of April 16, 2007, and estimated contract award for May 1, 2007.   These projected dates are revised as follows:  estimated issue date o/a April 20, 2007, estimated proposal due date May 16, 2007, estimated contract award June 1, 2007.  The delay in issuance is due to a combination of circumstances which precluded VAPHS from developing reasonably accurate requirements and a complete scope of work by the originally scheduled dates.

<CONTACT>MARILYN J. HUTCHISON PURCHASING AGENT 3032369321     mhutchi@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of this synopsis. Salient characteristics:  The U.S. Geological Survey has an ongoing requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI).  The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States. Requirement is for office space on-site at the University of Memphis, as well as a graduate research assistant, some office support, computer network access with CERI, and other miscellaneous services, including mail and copying services and a dedicated fax line.  The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center (ARC), is assessing the market to gain information on commercial off-the-shelf invoicing routing and approval system requirements. The ARC serves as a Shared Service Provider offering administrative services to other federal agencies.  The customer agencies vary in size and have headquarters and field offices in locations throughout the United States.  One of these services, Accounts Payable (AP), requires invoices to be routed and approved by Certifying Officials at the customer agencies.  These invoices arrive from the vendor to the ARC Accounts Payable office.  After some initial work by the technician, the invoices are routed through various contacts at the customer agencies for approval.  The customer agency applies their approval, includes any comments or instructions such as proper accounting, and routes the invoice back to AP.   

In order to more efficiently service our customers, ARC is seeking information on applications that will minimize the paper flow, streamline the invoice routing and approval process and meet the following requirements:

General
1.	Integration with Oracle Federal Financials.
2.	Provide real-time monitoring of performance metrics on user activity as well as queue status and volume.
3.	End user (approver) hardware/software setup and configuration should be minimal.
4.	Must comply with Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act.

Input
1.	Accept Hard copy invoices that are imaged.
2.	Provide means to easily image batches of invoices into the system.
3.	Provide means to place Invoices in applicable organizational unit for processing.
4.	Accept electronic and faxed images.
5.	Accept Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) data and convert it to easily understandable format for users.
6.	Accept supplemental documents and comments and attach them to related invoice(s).

Routing and Approval
1.	Allow customizable business rules for workflow by organizational unit.
2.	Allow creation of customizable forms for use by customer agencies to submit data to AP.
3.	Provide customizable email notifications and reminders to various responsibilities that actions are pending.

Statement of Work Evaluation of the acute and persistant/resting memory phase responses of rabbits to rPA vaccine 1.  Purchase 16 New Zealand white rabbits, 8 males and 8 females, at 2.7-3.1 kg each.  Allow animals to acclimatize for 1 week, if necessary. 2.  Prebleed 16 rabbits prior to the start of the experiment for (i) 1 ml of serum and (ii) 14 ml of blood to isolate PBMCs.  These cells will serve as baseline values and negative controls for the lymphocyte proliferation assay, CD4/CD8/CD3 FACS, and real -time RT-PCR. 3.  One week after the pre-bleed, inject 50 µg rPA/Alhydrogel vaccine intramuscularly (0.5 ml each) into 12 rabbits (6 male and 6 female).  Inject 4 rabbits (2 male and 2 female) with PBS/Alhydrogel (age-matched controls).  Vaccine will be supplied by USAM RIID. 4.  Divide the rabbits into two groups A and B each of 6 rPA-immunized rabbits (3 males and 3 females) and 2 controls (1 male and 1 female).   5a.  Group A (acute memory phase);   A.  Bleed 8 rabbits on days 2, 4, and 6 for 2 ml of blood.  Send frozen serum to USAMRIID.   B.  Sacrifice 8 rabbits on day 7 by exanguination and harvest and purify PBMCs.   a.  Lymphocyte proliferation assay using cultured PBMCs stimulated with PA.  Include positive and negative controls.  USAMRIID will provide PA. b.

Scope of Work

A.  The Contractor shall be required to conduct a full scope financial audit of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights’ (the Commission) annual financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007.  

The audit shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), as specified in the most current version of the GAO’s Government Auditing Standards (GAS), and additional audit requirements of the OMB.  In conducting the audit, the methodology used shall be at a minimum, consistent with the most current version of the GAO/President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (GAO/PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM).  Should there be any deviations from the methodology set forth in the FAM, the Contractor must provide documentation to the COTR on a timely basis, demonstrating how the Contractor’s methodology satisfies the requirements of the FAM.  The COTR shall be notified immediately of any significant deviations from the FAM.

B.  With respect to internal control, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the components of internal control and assess the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosure components of the financial statements.  The Contractor shall also obtain an understanding of the components of internal control relating to the existence and completeness assertions relevant to the performance measures included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).

With respect to MD&A, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and manner of its presentation in the MD&A of the Reporting Entity is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements. In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall consider this required supplementary information and shall follow the guidelines presented in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform the procedures described in the AICPA’s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the design of internal controls relating to the existence and completeness assertions over performance measures and determine whether they have been placed in operation, as required by OMB Bulletin 01-02, as amended, or the most current OMB audit guidance.

With respect to Required Supplementary Stewardship Information (RSSI) and Required Supplementary Information (RSI), the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in the AICPA’s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA’s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.
 
With respect to Other Accompanying Information, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in AICPA’s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA’s AU Section 550, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.

C.  As part of the USCCR FY07 Financial Statement Audit, the Contractor shall perform procedures to assess the effectiveness of the information system control environment.  The procedures will focus on evaluating the adequacy of information systems controls over the following GAO’s Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) general control areas:

•	Entity-wide Security Program Planning and Management,
•	Access Controls (including mainframe system logical security and data center physical security),
•	Segregation of Duties (for data center management and operations),
•	Application Software Development and Change Control,
•	System Software Controls and Modification, and
•	Service Continuity.

This work will also be utilized by other USCCR personnel with respect to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.  Thus, the information system control environment review performed shall be coordinated with the COTR to ensure the work is completed timely enough for other USCCR personnel to use in performing their audits.

D.  The Contractor shall review the consolidated interim, draft, and final financial statement packages for compliance with USCCR requirements.  The Contractor shall document each review in the workpapers and notify the COTR of the results within seven (7) working days of the review.  Notification shall be in writing, through e-mail, or by fax.

E. Audit Documentation

All audit documentation shall be prepared in accordance with GAS and contain the required elements prescribed by GAS.  The contractor shall also consult the GAO/PCIE FAM for specific audit documentation contents.  At a minimum, audit documentation should include a summary memorandum documenting the conclusions reached on each significant internal control cycle, account balance, lead schedule, phase of the audit, audit adjustments, and on the overall audit.  Adequate indexing and cross referencing must exist.  The contractor shall also ensure that audit documentation contains the audit completion checklist FAM 1003. 

The Commission shall have ongoing access to auditors and audit documentation at all times.  USCCR will accept electronic work papers and adequately cross-referenced hard-copy files to meet this requirement.  These documents shall become the property of USCCR and shall not be disclosed outside of USCCR, unless required by statute or regulation, without the prior consent.

Audit documentation may also be subject to review by other Government auditors such as the GAO, therefore, the contractor shall make audit documentation available to the GAO or any other federal entity conducting a review or audit of USCCR. Based on the results of these reviews, the contractor may be required by the COTR to perform corrective action and/or additional work within the scope of the contract necessary to support its audit conclusions, if necessary.

Audit documentation shall be retained and safeguarded for a minimum of 2 years by the Contractor at no additional cost. Written approval must be obtained from the Commission's Office of General Counsel prior to destruction of any audit documentation. 

It is imperative that the Contractors protect all audit documentation from unauthorized access.  Only Contractor staff with a need to know shall have access to audit documentation.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:   

The intent of this competitive solicitation is to select multiple firms to perform plumbing, mechanical, and electrical, General Contractor discipline construction work and minor design services for various Indian Health Service Facilities in New Mexico as needed.

Phase I will be a competitive evaluation of the firms past performance history and qualifications. Each of these firms will be evaluated and rated and ranked by a source selection board. Up to five firms may be selected and requested to participate in Phase II.   

Phase II will be for the seed project and will involve minor design and may include, utilities and other infrastructure, mechanical engineering for building plumbing and HVAC systems, electrical engineering for building systems and site lighting, and any and all other incidental architectural and engineering tasks as required for a complete project.

The Indian Health Service will provide minimum specification and drawing packages to the selected contractors which shall be used as minimum requirements. The contractor’s will be required to design a complete building package providing the most amenities possible within the budgeted funds available conforming to the drawings and specification.  The estimated project size is in excess of $100,000.00 dollars for both design and construction. Some projects may be higher limits and some projects may be lower limits. Not all projects will require design efforts.  Pricing will be established as designing within fee limitations and the final construction lump sum price will be negotiated.

The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror. 

As the need develops, each of the five firms will be issued minimum plans and specifications and requested to submit a technical and price proposal. Again, award will be made to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered.

Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the proposed contract.  Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussion.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical Capability to meet the Government’s requirement:

The offeror shall submit written evidence of a certified technician to maintain equipment manufactured by Miller.  This is a pass/fail factor.  

Past Performance:

The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the Contractor Performance Evaluation Survey that is included in the solicitation.  This is a pass/fail factor.  To be considered for award, the offeror must have an overall Past Performance Rating other than “POOR” (see “Contractor Performance Evaluation Survey Rating Sheet”).  If an offeror has a “POOR” rating, their offer will be considered unacceptable.  This survey should be sent to representatives familiar with your performance (Government, State, Private Industry contracts).  The representative should submit the form directly to the contracting officer for this requirement.

Price:

The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror submitting a technically acceptable proposal, having acceptable past performance, and the lowest evaluated price.

(b) A Low Price Technically Acceptable best value evaluation technique will be used to evaluate offers.  The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror submitting a technically acceptable proposal, having acceptable past performance, and the lowest evaluated price.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of clause)


PROPOSAL SUBMITTALS

All contractors responding must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at 
http://www.ccr.gov/.

Ability to meet the requirements set forth in this RFQ shall be demonstrated by the contractor’s submission of a signed offer, which hasn’t taken exception to the schedule. Offers that take exception and do not meet Government’s requirement, may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a revised Request for Quotations (RFQ) for leased office space that will house NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) employees. The Government’s baseline requirements are required submittals in the Offeror’s proposal in order for the proposal to be considered for further evaluation. The Government’s value characteristics, or trade-offs, are not required characteristics in the Offeror’s proposal; however, they are highly encouraged. The Government contemplates a firm fixed price contract. The lease will be twelve month period of performance with two, three month options for a total of an eighteen month potential period of performance. BASELINE REQUIREMENTS: The building shall have a minimum of 8,000 available square feet on one floor.	The building shall provide a combination of open space and at least ten single offices, with one conference room seating at least 50 people. The building shall be open to NASA employees from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm seven days a week. Parking spaces shall accommodate approximately 50 people. The office space shall be identified, at a minimum, as CLASS C office space.  CLASS C space is a classification used to described buildings that generally qualify as older buildings offering basic space and command lower rents or sale prices compared to other buildings in the same market.  Such buildings typically have below-average maintenance and management, and could have mixed or low tenant prestige, inferior elevators, and/or mechanical/electrical systems.	These buildings lack prestige and must depend chiefly on a lower price to attract tenants and investors. Price proposal which includes a firm fixed price for the basic twelve month lease with separate pricing for each of the two, three month option periods. VALUE CHARACTERISTICS: Size of the office space: Consideration will be given to proposed buildings with available space in excess of 8,000 square feet with a maximum of 14,000 available square feet on one floor. Space configuration of the office space:  Consideration will be given to proposed buildings that offer at least 8,000 square feet of contiguous available space. Number of Single offices: Consideration will be given to the number of single offices in excess of ten offices. Number of Conference rooms: Consideration will be given to the number and seating limit of conference rooms in excess of the baseline requirement of 50 people. Number of available Parking spaces: Consideration will be given to the number of parking spaces in excess of 50 spaces. Classification Type of Building CLASS B office space: Consideration will be given to CLASS B office space. CLASS B space is a classification used to describe buildings that generally qualify as a more speculative investment, and as such, command lower rents or sales prices compared to CLASS A properties.  Such buildings offer utilitarian space without special attractions, and have ordinary design, if new or fairly new; good to excellent design if an older non-landmark building.	These buildings typically have average to good maintenance, management and tenants.  They are less appealing to tenants than Class A properties, and may be deficient in a number of respects including floor plans, condition and facilities.  They lack prestige and must depend chiefly on a lower price to attract tenants and investors.    CLASS A office space: Consideration will be given to CLASS A office space.  CLASS A space is a classification used to describe buildings that generally qualify as extremely desirable investment-grade properties and command the highest rents or sale prices compared to other buildings in the same market.  Such buildings are well located and provide efficient tenant layouts as well as high quality, and in some buildings, one-of-a-kind unique floor plans.  These buildings contain modern mechanical systems, and have above-average maintenance and management as well as the best quality materials and workmanship in their trim and interior fittings.  They are generally the most attractive and eagerly sought by investors willing to pay a premium for quality.  IT Cost Considerations:   1.  Line of Sight: Consideration will be given to proposals that have an unobstructed clear line of sight from the roof of the facility to the roof of Building 45 (the second tallest building on the JSC campus).  This will allow for wireless communications. 2.  North Side of NASA Parkway: Consideration will be given to proposed buildings that are located on the north side of NASA Parkway. This will allow compatibility with other Government communications systems.  3. Copper Wiring: Consideration will be given to proposals that have existing Category 5 copper cabling. This will allow for installation of JSC workstations and phones. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Once leased, the property may undergo minor modifications such as moved walls, doors, electrical outlets, and installation of security systems to accommodate the needs of NASA JSC.  Any prohibitions or restrictions against such modifications shall be expressly stated in the proposal. The Government intends to view the proposed property after receipt of proposals.  Dates and times will be determined with the Offerors after receipt of proposals. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION: Proposals must address, at a minimum, all baseline requirements, including the following pricing information: Proposal prices shall be identified for the twelve month base period and each three month option.   Prices shall include additional elements that comprise the square footage price such as, but not limited to, overhead, management fees, janitorial fees and utilities.	A description detailing such elements shall be included in the proposal.	 In addition, Offerors shall submit a floor plan clearly identifying the proposed available space. Proposals must be submitted to the contracting activity identified below by 3 PM CDT 4/16/07: NASA JSC Attn: Maria Alberty/BJ3 2101 NASA Parkway Houston, TX 77058 EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with consideration given to price and other factors considered in the RFQ.
