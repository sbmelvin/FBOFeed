<DESC>The Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate, Code 500, of the Goddard Space Flight Center plans to enter into a contract with General Dynamics Decision Systems, Inc. on a sole source basis, to provide the development of a Crosslink Channel Simulator (CCS)to NASA/GSFC for use in the Formation Flying Testbed (FFTB). This FY04 effort is an augmentation of the prototype CCS that was developed and delivered successfully in FY03 by General Dynamics Decision Systems, Inc.   The CCS is required to introduce environmental effects including signal delay, attenuation, and Doppler shift into the radio frequency (RF) channel between two or more satellite crosslinks based on satellite state information, which is provided as input.	These requirements are necessary for the Technology Readiness Level advancement of satellite crosslink transceivers, which are enabling technology for formation flying missions such as MMS and ST-9 (Formation Flying). The planned deliverable is an extension of the prototype that General Dynamics delivered in FY03; it is expected that the hardware in the prototype will serve as the foundation for the FY04 delivery unit.  Since the prototype delivery unit contains General Dynamic's proprietary hardware and software, General Dynamics is the only company with the capability to utilize and extend the functionality of the prototype unit.  Any other source would have to duplicate or significantly overlap the engineering  and hardware costs of the prototype development, which would exceed the cost and schedule constraints of the FFTB. The statutory authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Any other firm desiring consideration must fully identify its capabilities or submit a proposal within (15) days of publication of this synopsis, to the Goddard Space Flight Center office and individual listed.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. 

Note: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov/, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.


I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

Changes proposed include construction of a new bankruptcy courtroom, several training rooms for the AOUSC, and consolidation and expansion of other existing tenants.  In addition, mechanical upgrades, restroom improvements, and fire safety improvements are included to make the building both more functional and modern for long-term housing of the proposed tenants.

<DESC>This procurement is in support of the Joint Program Management Office-Individual Protection Alternate Footwear Solution (AFS) project. The AFS project is a subset of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) program.  Its goal is to acquire a chemical/biological (CB) protective overboot that requires less volume/package space than the overboots currently in use by the Joint Services.  Additionally, the Government seeks an overboot that can be manufactured for proper fit over the joint service boot population with significantly fewer sizes than overboots in the current inventory.  The development of an overboot that requires less volume is necessary to lighten the carrying weight and placement burdens on the individual warfighter, as well as to improve/lessen the overall storage and transportation requirements of CB overboots.

RAYTHEON shall function as the Government’s Commercial Stock Point for these spares including the performance of all routine inventory management functions including receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling in addition to performance and ILS functions (to include configuration management, training, technical manuals, support and test equipment).  Besides Navy, other potential customers for individual systems may include Coast Guard, US Marines and two land-based test sites.  The goal is to sustain and  maintain the established, current Supply Material Availability (SMA) goal of 85% and comply with established performance delivery ‘availability’ standards of 1, 3 and 15 days for  CASREP/IPG1s, critical items and non-critical items (‘all others’)  within the Readiness Based Sparing (RBS)/Secondary Item Weapon System Management (SIWSM) maintenance model while simultaneously reducing overall support costs.   NAVICP-M is currently processing an ‘OMNIBUS’ solicitation with Raytheon Corp. with a scheduled award in August 2004 that provides as ‘menu items’  the ‘best of breed’ provisions/options for the establishment and operation of a PBL program under a fifteen year term requirements contract for various sole source, Raytheon manufactured weapon systems, including the CEC.  Synopsis of the OMNIBUS occurred 10 March 2004 via Navy Electronic Commerce Online and specifically cited t hese systems.  Each system, including the CEC, is also separately clinned in the OMNIBUS Request for Proposal, release on 10 March 2004,  for potential, future placement of delivery orders.  The OMNIBUS goal is a flexible, streamlined PBL process between the Navy and Raytheon that would leverage heavily on standardization of terms and conditions for all systems to reduce administrative lead-time (ALT) /cycle time, process variation(s) and cost.  Following award of the OMNIBUS, the CEC will be awarded as ‘tailored’, individual delivery order, called ‘plug-in’.  The OMNIBUS provides for pricing on either a fixed priced or cost type basis depending on the system maturity and stage of development.  Individual order pricing may transition from cost to fixed price for a particular system as reliable pricing data becomes available.  CEC pricing will be on a fixed price basis.  Raytheo n’s final proposal for the CEC must demonstrate a savings compared to Navy support costs as determined by an independent cost benefit analysis.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Florida intends to award a sole source contract to Trelleborg Engineered Systems, Trelleborg Industri AB SE-23181 Trelleborg, Sweden for the procurement of one roll of the Extra Wide Width, rubber coated material (77.5 inches wide). This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons. The extra wide material would enable us to manufacture Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) skirt fingers from one panel of material versus two panels spliced together. Our present material (50 inches wide) exhibits failures from the bonded splice. If testing is successful this new extra wide material will eliminate premature replacement of the fingers.  After extensive market research, we have located no other rubber-coated fabric manufacturer, domestic or foreign, who is able to produce fabric of this width without significant investment in new equ ipment. NAICS Code313320 Applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 Employees. FSC 9320.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 9, 2004.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Prime One Contracting for removal and repair of Horiba LDV chassis dynamometer.   The Light-duty LDV-48-86-125HP-AC D002 is issuing a bearing speed error warning.  Repair of this fault is essential for accurate and repeatable usage of this equipment.   Removal and repair of the chassis dynamometer will include the replacement or repair of motorized bearings.   Due to the cost of removing this dynamometer from the pit, other components not associated with the dynamometer failure will be cleaned, rebuilt or replaced to minimize future maintenance and repairs.   Prime One is the proprietary owner of the Horiba dynamometer software and therefore is the only available source for the repair.  Additionally,  Prime One has established procedures for diagnostics and calibration not available to other contractors. The motorized bearings where made only for Horiba LDV dynamometers. Prime One has access to all parts and has them readily available.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above. Documentation must be received by April 9, 2004 in order to be considered by the EPA.

The Battlespace Environment Division, Space Vehicles Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory is interested in receiving proposals related to the development and on-orbit demonstration of spacecraft instrumentation for the in-situ measurement, global characterization and stimulation of space particles and plasma in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime, nominally defined as approximately 6000 km perigee, 12000 km apogee with inclination between 0 - 70 degrees. Measurements of particle populations should include spectral resolution over the following ranges: cold plasma; low energy electrons and protons (100 ev - 50 keV); medium energy electrons (50 keV - 1 MeV); high energy trapped electrons (1 MeV - 30 MeV); loss cone electrons (100 - 500 keV), medium energy protons (50 keV - 10 MeV); and high energy trapped protons (10 MeV - 450 MeV). Local pitch-angle distributions should be measured for the trapped particle populations and the DC magnetic field determined to enable mapping of local measurements to other magnetospheric locations. The local plasma index of refraction should be determined using measurements of the DC magnetic field and cold plasma density.  Dosimetry measurements behind a range of shielding between 0.08 and 0.25 inches of aluminum with differentiation between electron and proton generated dose are desired. Models of instrument response to expected environment conditions are desired in order to better calibrate and interpret the data. Instrumentation should be provided to measure the amplitude and mode structure of the in-situ plasma wave field in the 100 Hz to 50 kHz frequency range and it is expected that at least two orthogonal components of both the electric and magnetic fields will need to be measured. Crossed 16 meter and 51 meter tip-to-tip booms oriented approximately perpendicular to the local magnetic field shall be provided by the satellite vendor to host the electric field antennas as a conducting component of the boom itself. Wave instrument providers are expected to work closely with the satellite vendors to ensure that the conducting boom system meets the plasma wave measurement requirements. A capability to transmit waves in the frequency range 1- 50 kHz with the intent to stimulate pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the nominal altitude regime of 1.0 - 2.0 Earth radii should be provided. Up to 2 kW of power will be available and it is anticipated that the provider will work closely with the Air Force Research Laboratory to evaluate and implement dynamic tuning circuit technologies to maximize the efficiency of the far-field radiated power. The proposer may combine measurements of various particle types and energy range into single instruments as appropriate; similarly the offeror may combine any plasma wave measurements into single instruments, as appropriate, with the exception of the transmitter and receiver technology which must be proposed as independent items.  The offeror shall price the design, manufacture, calibration and integration of any proposed instrument. Costs for on-orbit instrument turn-on and initial calibration, nominally done in the first three months of operations are also required. However, proposed work directed at analysis and archiving of the experimental data is not requested in this PRDA. Project Statement Spacecraft Instrumentation to Measure and Stimulate Space Particles and Plasma Waves in the Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) Regime 1. BACKGROUND The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is responsible for the development and execution of the Deployable Structures Experiment (DSX), a suite of four science payloads integrated onto a Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring based three axis stabilized satellite bus nominally slated for launch into a 6000 x 12000 km, 30 degree inclination Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) in the 2007-2008 timeframe with one year required and three year desired operational capability. Scientific research will be conducted with DSX in the areas of (a) the deployment, dynamics, control and MEO environment degradation of large deployable space structures, (b) the performance, radiation tolerance, plasma interactions and annealing of thin film photovoltaics (TFPV) in the MEO environment, (c) the physics of plasma wave injection, propagation, and wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere as relevant to radiation belt remediation RBR techniques; and (d) the measurement and mapping of energetic particle and plasma distributions in the poorly characterized MEO region. This PRDA seeks proposals of original and innovative research dealing with the development and demonstration of space instrumentation to support both the Space Weather (SWx) and the Radiation Belt Remediation (RBR) payloads on DSX. 2. PROJECT STATEMENT 2.1 Space Weather Specification and Mapping Payload The SWx specification and mapping payload will operate in support of two purposes: to provide particle fluxes and radiation doses to (a) evaluate the performance of the mission's TFPV panels and the its inflatable deployable structures and (b) improve the radiation belt and plasma models in the MEO regime. The TFPV consists of a 10 x 14 foot square panel containing front-side regions of 0.06 inch thick CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) and 0.07 inch thick amorphous silicon with a back-side of 0.08 inch thick plastic material.  Energy ranges of interest for panel damage range from 0.1 keV to 10 MeV for protons and 100 eV to 1 MeV for electrons. Deployable structures are nominally constructed  of  0.1 inch thick plastic material components deployed at the beginning of the mission and left extended for the duration. A photometry system will measure the position of the tips of the structures and data from the desired space environment instruments will be used to correlate the structure changes to radiation damage. Energy ranges of interest for structure damage ranges from 1 keV to 10 MeV for protons and 0.1 keV to 1 MeV for electrons. To achieve the SWx payload science goals proposers should address the following measurement and modeling objectives. Note that AFRL has already acquired instruments to measure medium energy electrons (20 keV - 1 MeV) and a portion of the medium energy protons (20 keV- 1 Mev). The description of these objective is included for completeness in describing the full payload capabilities. 2.1.1 Electrons - Low energy population (100 eV < E < 50 keV) responsible for effects that include surface charging and damage to TFPV panels.  Energy resolution should be 20-30 logarithmically spaced channels.   Field-of-view should be sufficient to determine the effect of this population on the TFPV panel with 1 - 5 second time resolution. Pitch-angle resolution is not required. - Medium energy population responsible for effects that include deep dielectric charging (50 keV < E < 1 MeV). Field-of-View should be > 25 degrees (opening half angle) with a sufficient number of differential energy channels to determine the energy deposition to TFPV panels and deployable space structures as well as the shape of the electron flux spectrum between 0.1-1.0 MeV in the nominal MEO orbit regime. Pitch-angle resolution of ten degrees within the field of view is desired.  Time resolution of the data should be of the order of 5 to 10 seconds to allow correlation between collected data and spacecraft anomalies. - High energy population (1 MeV < E < 30 MeV) responsible for effects that include damage to internal spacecraft components. This population is not isotropic and should be measured with sufficient angular resolution to image the loss cone and reconstruct the pitch angle distribution with an accuracy of 7 to 12 degrees (opening half angle).  Since the DSX spacecraft is not a spinner and the pitch angle measurements must be made using the sensor's field-of-view alone.  The sensor must be able to make accurate measurements (less than 10% contamination) in presence of high-energy proton population in the inner belt and during solar particle events. 2.1.2 Protons - Low energy population (100 eV < E < 50 keV) responsible for effects that include damage to TFPV panels.  Energy resolution should be 20-30 logarithmically spaced channels.   Field-of-view should be sufficient to determine the effect of this population on the TFPV panel, approximately 25 to 50 degrees.  Pitch-angle resolution is not required. Time resolution of the data should be of the order of 5 to 10 seconds to allow correlation between collected data and spacecraft anomalies. - Medium energy population (50 keV < E < 10 MeV) responsible for effects that include damage to TFPV panels, deployable structures and lightly shielded spacecraft components. Field-of-View should be > 25 degrees (opening half angle)  Sufficient differential energy channels to determine the shape of the proton energy spectra, so that its deposition pattern in the TFPV can be determined. Pitch-angle resolution of ten degrees within the field of view is desired. Time resolution of the data should be of the order of 5 to 10 seconds to allow correlation between collected data and spacecraft anomalies. - High energy proton population (10 MeV < E to 400-500 MeV) responsible for effects that include single event upsets and dose degradation. Knowledge of this population is needed to develop new, improved climatological, specification and forecasting models of high energy protons in the MEO regime.  This population is not isotropic and must be measured is sufficient angular resolution to image the loss cone and reconstruct the pitch angle distribution with an accuracy of 7 to 12 degrees (opening half angle).  Since the DSX spacecraft is not a spinner and the pitch angle measurements must be made using the sensor's field-of-view alone.  The sensor must be able to make accurate measurements (less than 10% contamination) in presence of high-energy electron population in the outer belt and during solar particle events. 2.1.3 Dosimetry Radiation dosimetry measurements are desired behind 0.08 and 0.25 inches of aluminum.  The degrader shape may be flat of hemispherical.  Field-of view should be close to 180 degrees. Differentiation of the dose due to electrons and protons is desired. 2.1.4 Single Event Effects Single Event Effects are events where a high-energy particle traversing a digital device creates sufficient charge in a cell of the device to change its state, with potentially harmful results.  The absolute probability of these events depends on the spectrum of the incident particles and the exact device type.  Nevertheless, a relative probability may be obtained without detailed knowledge of all the parameters.  A measure of this relative probability is desired. 2.1.5 DC Magnetic Field Three dimensional DC magnetic field measurements (0 to 20 Hz) are needed to reconstruct particle pitch angle distributions.  This need requires the measurement of the magnetic field between in the range of 100 to 10,000 nT with a sensitivity of 1 nT and with the field vector accuracy of < 1 degrees at all points in the orbit. If a boom is required the offeror must specify the desired material and length.  Boom will be provided by the spacecraft contractor. 2.1.6 Instrument Response Modeling Capabilities to use computer programs to develop and implement models of DSX sensors are desired.  The models will be used to extract physical data from the instrument responses in cases where the instrument calibrations prove inadequate or unrealistic.  Programs must run on AFRL computers and all software must be delivered to AFRL. 2.2 Radiation Belt Remediation Payload The purpose of  the RBR payload is to (a) characterize the inner magnetospheric natural and man-made electromagnetic radiation environment in the 0.1-50 kHz frequency range to include plasma mode structure, (b) determine the efficiency of injecting  1- 50 kHz (hereafter referred to as the Very Low Frequency (VLF) regime) electromagnetic wave power into the inner magnetosphere from a space platform, and (c) demonstrate perturbations on space particle populations due to injected VLF wave power. To achieve these objectives the payload components described below are anticipated. Proposers should structure the proposal in a manner that will allow the selection of individual components. 2.2.1 Electric Field Receiver Measurements should be made of electric fields from 100 Hz to 50 kHz at a sensitivity of approximately 1E-16 V^2/(m^2-Hz) and 16 bit resolution. Two boom structures will be provided with a nominal extensions of 16 meters and 51 meters tip-to-tip orientated orthogonal to the local magnetic field and each other. Though the boom structures will not be the responsibility of the offeror, the proposed effort should include interactions with the boom provider to ensure appropriate widths, conductance, and other relevant properties. The offeror should provide options to employ either or both of the two booms. 2.2.2 Magnetic Field Receiver Measurements should be made of magnetic field components from 100 Hz to 50 kHz at a sensitivity of approximately 1E-11 nt^2/Hz and 16 bit resolution in at least two directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. An option for a measurement of the component along the direction of the magnetic field is desired. If a boom or booms are required the offeror must specify the desired material and length.  Boom(s) will be provided by other payload or spacecraft providers. 2.2.3 Electric Field Transmitter The instrument must be designed to produce electromagnetic radiation capable of causing pitch angle scattering of greater than 100 keV electrons trapped in the inner magnetosphere. A nominal 51 meter tip-to-tip boom structure will be provided orientated orthogonal to the local magnetic field. Though the boom structure will not be the responsibility of the offeror, the proposed effort should included interactions with the boom provider to ensure appropriate widths, conductance, and other relevant properties. On-orbit power will be provided by two systems: (a) a standard 135 W average power (255 W peak) commercial solar panel and (b) the TFPV experimental panel capable of providing 1-2 kW. The transmitter must be able to couple to both power systems and must be designed to optimize far-field radiated power using the 1-2 kW source. Offerors should plan on working closely with AFRL scientists and engineers to evaluate and implement antenna dynamic matching network that will be provided separately from the instrumentation requested in this PRDA. Dynamic tuning circuitry is required to optimize performance as the near-field plasma sheaths and currents change in the course of a wave period. Designs should have the ability to default to standard tuning circuitry. 2.2.4 Loss Cone Electron Detector Knowledge of  the loss cone electrons (100 to 500 keV with velocity nearly parallel to the local magnetic field) is needed to understand and quantify the effects of the transmitter on the scattering of the trapped electron population into the loss cone.  The field-of-view must be less than 10 degrees since the loss cone angle is about 16 degrees at the DSX altitudes.  Expected loss cone fluxes are of the order of 100 to 10,000 electrons / cm^2-sec-sr at E = 300 keV, with E falling off as exp(-E/150) with E in keV. 2.2.5 Local Cold Plasma Density Measurements of in-situ cold plasma density is required which, together with the DC magnetic field measurements, will allow the determination of the local index of refraction. Sounding technique methods which extend the transmitter and receiver frequency ranges will be acceptable provided they are competitive in cost and spacecraft resources with direct sampling techniques. 3.  Spacecraft 3.1	Power The spacecraft Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) system will provide appropriate power input to the RBR transmitters.  The PMAD system will provide to each transmitter a voltage of 100 Volts DC and a total power of 2 kW.  An experimental solar panel will provide the primary input power for the PMAD box with approximately 2.2 kW of power at approximately 100 V DC.  Any secondary power necessary to energize the PMAD box will be provided from the spacecraft primary solar array.  The specifications are summarized below: PMAD Primary Input Power: < 2.2 kW at ±50 VDC PMAD Secondary Input Power: <10 W at 28 VDC PMAD Output Voltage: 100±8 VDC (2-4 channels) PMAD Output Power: 2.0 kW (total) PMAD Power Conversion Efficiency: >90% 3.2  Attitude and Control and Determination System (ADCS) Type: 3-axis stabilized (desired nominal) for Normal Mode Attitude Control: <2º per axis, 3s Attitude Knowledge: <1º per axis, 3s Orbit Determination Accuracy: ±5 km 3.3  Launch Schedule The nominal launch date is mid 2007.  Instrument delivery integration testing at is mid 2006.  There is a possibility of a launch delayed to mid 2008, and a corresponding instrument delivery date of mid 2007.  Proposers should indicate the effect of the two delivery dates on hardware development and cost.  Proposers should include the costs of instrument integration in their cost section of the proposal. 4.  Other The instrument shall have an RS-422 data interface, unless specific permission for another interface is granted by AFRL.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The US Environmental Protection Agency, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, and in accordance with FAR Part 12, intends to issue a purchase order for a Particle Size Analysis System required by the National Enforcement  Investigations Center (NEIC).   The mission of the U.S. EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) is to support the enforcement of environmental statutes and the clean-up of contaminated sites.  To provide the necessary support for these activities, the NEIC is required to conduct a  wide variety of analytical techniques to characterize as many varieties of materials as possible.  Because environmental contamination and contamination source identification involve a countless variety of materials and a wide range of sample matrices and sample sizes, the NEIC's analytical  capabilities must be as comprehensive and flexible as possible.  Therefore, the specifications required by the NEIC for a particle size analysis system must also be as comprehensive and flexible as possible for NEIC to fulfill its mission.  The NEIC requires a system with the following  specifications to meet its objectives: (1) The particle size analysis system must measure the particle size range of 0.02 to 2000 micrometers in one millisecond or less (1000 scans/second); employ two light sources including a HeNe gas and a blue solid state laser; employ an algorithm made up of a  single uniform theory using angular light scattering technology and full Mie theory over the particle size range given above; and have a modular design with all sampler accessories external to the optical bench for changeover in less than 30 seconds. (2) The particle size analysis system must have  an automated sample dispersion unit with a capacity of 800 ml or greater; an internal ultrasonic probe with variable power and duration settings; and the capability of direct attachment to a liquid source, allowing automatic software control of draining, rinsing, and filling between samples. (3)  The particle size analysis system must have a dry powder sampler with air pressure that is software controlled, measured, recorded, and continuously variable from 0 to 4 Bar pressure.   (4) The particle size analysis system must have a small volume sample capability of 18 ml or less with a  temperature sensor; control of sample temperature by a circulating constant temperature bath; an internal ultrasonic probe with variable power and duration settings for applying dispersion energy during measurement; and the capability to pump sample particles through a dispersion cell, allowing  free flow of magnetic particles and suspension of larger or denser particles.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Columbus is soliciting interested Parties to participate in this Unrestricted Commercial Part 12 Solicitation, for spare parts to be used on AM General Weapons Systems.  The scope of this contract includes all DLA managed items for which AM General is an approved source or that they have supplied in the past. Items within the scope may be added to the solicitation or any resulting contract(s) at a later date.  

This acquisition will result in Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Quantity Contracts for delivery to stock only.  The initial contract period will be two years with one three-year fixed-price option period.  The estimated two-year base period value is $12,008,947.54, totaling $30,022,268.85 with option. 

FSCs include the following:

FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC
1005	2815	3950	5895	5999
1010	2910	4030	5905	6625

2590	3020	4820	5980	
2805	3040	4910	5985	

Submission of solicitation pricing will be phased – approximately 100 NSNs every 30 days, prioritized by demand and whether or not the NSN is identified for Reset*.  Phased pricing will allow all vendors the opportunity to offer on as many NSNs as possible.  The Government may make multiple awards (maximum two for each NSN) by NSN where high-density items cannot be supported by a single source of supply.  However, this will ultimately be determined by the competition received.  An all or none clause is not included.  

For NSNs resulting in a single award, the managing activity will issue delivery orders by means of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), using the conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI X12) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will be using a Distribution Point with connections to several Value Added Networks (VANs) for passing transactions to vendors in ANSI X12 format.  Supplies will be ordered using the following EDI Transaction Sets:  

(1)	Transaction Set 850 – Call/Order
(2)	 Transaction Set 810 - Invoice

To determine the offeror(s) that provide the best value to the Government, the Agency will use the trade-off process (instead of the lowest priced technically acceptable source selection process).  

Access to a complete list of NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts/cc.asp on the date of issue.  It is impracticable to distribute the applicable drawings with the solicitation, however, they will be available at <http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp>.   If the drawings are not posted at this web site, see Clause L11D02Availability of Drawings for information on how to obtain the drawings.  FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC.

*Reset is a major effort to "repair and refit" Army and Marine Corps units that have recently returned from deployment. It involves bringing more than 20,000 wheeled and 3,000 tracked vehicles, every aviation system in Southwest Asia and 300 different command and control systems to a condition where they can be reissued for use by units replacing soldiers redeploying from Iraq or be used to fight another conflict anywhere in the world. The Marine Corps Reconstitution effort, while smaller in scale, is equally important.

An announcement regarding the above requirement was published in FedBizOpps on June 5, 2003, and again on December 10, 2003 using Solicitation USM-03-20.  That Solicitation number is no longer valid and is changed to USM-04-29.  

The procurement process will be in two (2) stages with a Pre-Qualification stage followed by proposals submitted by Pre-Qualified bidders.  A thorough knowledge of federal government auditing practices and procedures, as well as auditing of financial statements of manufacturing organizations having multiple locations, will be mandatory.

Any organization interested in competing for the contract must submit the following information to the Contracting Officer BY EMAIL ONLY AND RECEIVED NOT LATER THAN Friday, April 9, 2004: (a) proper name, full address and telephone number of the organization to be listed; and (b) name, email address, telephone number and facsimile telephone number of that organization’s single point of contact (POC).  It is requested that only the single POC communicate with the Contracting Officer.

To register as a Bidder, send your request by email to: Richard S. Kahn, Contracting Officer, at richard.kahn@usmint.treas.gov.  The United States Mint is not responsible for receipt of transmitted emails.  NOTE:  Organizations that responded to the previous announcements and were on the Bidders List under USM-03-20 have automatically been placed on the Bidders List for USM-04-29.

In keeping with the Procurement Integrity Act and in order to ensure fairness to all potential participants, telephone calls regarding this procurement will NOT be accepted.

Please note: in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 5136, no provisions of law governing procurement or public contracts are applicable to the procurement of goods or services necessary for carrying out United States Mint programs and operations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>On or about 5 April 2004, the US Government, TACOM-ARDEC, plans to release a final RFP on a full and open competition basis for the development of a  streamlined Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) for ARDEC.  This requirement stems  from an ARDEC reorganization at the enterprise level to better support the  organizations customers across diverse products and technologies.  The EKB will  provide internal and external resources access to critical technical and  management information designed to execute new programs and service life cycle  customers.  The EKB must be capable of handling diverse point solutions by  leveraging and connecting to existing ARDEC knowledge base systems built upon  disparate technologies, as well as, provide an easy upload layer for creating  new knowledge views where required.  The EKB will be more than just a  repository.  It will allow for the ARDEC population and its customer base to  easily extract, through an integrated search engine, specific information from  the repository and most importantly through an integrated toolset dispense this  knowledge in a collaborative environment where working team members or a  concerned community can jointly review, make changes and incorporate into their  programs or service needs. The ARDEC enterprise knowledge base will be integrated into the existing ARDEC  Knowledge Management (KM) enterprise architecture.  This architecture consists  of SUN hardware, Solaris Unix operating system, Oracle database, WEB interface  (capable of running on both Internet Explorer and NETSCAPE),  and a Hitachi  Storage Area Network (SAN) for data redundancy and continuity of operations.   The overall knowledge base will be inexpensive to manage and leave the user  base satisfied with the methods for processing their information and preserving  enterprise content.  The content will cover a wide range of technical and  management information designed at providing quick access to technical data,  historical program data, engineering data, product specific data, and  management data covering human and physical assets, strategic planning and  customer relationships. The contractor will need to have proficient skills in the IT architecture  previously defined, an expansive skill set that will cover the diverse data  requirements, and most importantly an in-depth knowledge of all the ARDEC  product lines and facilities, as well as, overall expertise in US Army Ordnance  and their related weapon systems. The period of performance will be one year from contract award with four (4)  one year options.  A 30 day response time for this RFP is anticipated.  Note 1 applies.

BACKGROUND:  

The Inspector General Department of Defense (IG DoD) is currently implementing a long-range strategy to conduct audits of DoD financial statements. Agency financial statements are required by the Chief Financial Officer’s Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576), which mandates agencies prepare financial statements and subsequent audits of the financial statements. For a sample of financial statements and related reports, go to http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/03report.htm and select reports D-2003-050, D-2003-047, D-2003-042.

The Department’s financial statements must cover all accounts and associated activities of each office, bureau, and activity of each component within the DoD.  The IG DoD must verify the reliability of agency financial statements through the use of audits and other methods.  Currently, the Department’s financial statements are being developed using various financial management systems throughout the DoD.  The reliability of these systems directly impacts the DoD’s ability to produce reliable financial statements.  

The IG DoD is committed to increasing the resources devoted to auditing the financial statements, and the related financial management business activities.  The IG DoD’s strategy is intended to facilitate the Department’s commitment to improve financial management and attain auditable financial statements that support an unqualified opinion.  To accomplish this strategy, NAVAIR intends to issue a subsequent RFI to conduct CFO audits, Statement of Auditing Standards 70/88 Reviews of DoD Service Organizations, Assessment of DoD Financial Management Systems, Audit Readiness Assessments, and Remediation Plans.  Commercial sources may include but are not limited to Independent Public Accounting Firms (IPA’s) and Information Technology (IT) firms.  

SERVICES REQUIRED: 

Reliability Assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems 

Sources are sought to conduct reliability assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems including related operations, activities, functions, and processes, used to compile and prepare the DoD’s financial statements.  The assessments will also determine whether internal controls over financial reporting are in place and operating as intended.  

A reliability assessment is a preliminary evaluation to determine if an entity’s financial statements can withstand a full-scale audit and is a means by which to identify significant issues, if any, that may preclude the performance of a full-scale financial statement audit.  The specific services required for each type of assessment will be reflected in individual statements of work for each task order.

A performance work statement will be developed on a cases-by-case basis describing the technical requirements, and functional performance requirements and the nature and type of service(s) needed.

The reliability assessments, in some instances, must conform to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) [http://www.gao.gov/govaud/yb2003.pdf] and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards.  However, individual task orders with a limited objective may be issued that do not require compliance with GAGAS or the AICPA standards.  The IG DoD will monitor the contractor’s work through the use of periodic contractor reporting and ongoing access to contractor’s working papers.  The IG DoD will also determine whether the contractor’s work complies with GAGAS and that the work supports the assessment conclusions.  Task order contracts will be issued with variable performance timeframes reflected in each order.  It is envisioned that IPA or IT firms with IG DoD oversight can conduct the reliability assessments. 

Contract Objective(s).  The overall program objective is to determine whether various DoD financial statements, taken as a whole, are accurately presented in all material respects, and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Specifically, individually awarded task orders will determine the accuracy and reliability of various DoD Financial Management Systems, including related processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of agency financial statements.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

An interested party should be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, experience with evaluating information systems in terms of fulfillment of purpose, design efficiency, appropriate controls, data integrity, integration with external systems, and human interface.  NAVAIR-AD intends to award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required. Experience may include, both government and commercial work that the offeror has performed.  Demonstrated evidence may include, but not be limited to customer names and addresses, description of work performed/delivered, description of types/complexity of systems worked on, description of strategies to accomplish the work, description of communication strategies with the customer, and significant accounting and information technology issues resolved.  If applicable, highlight any work performed with accounting/financial management systems and/or government information systems (include contract numbers).  Interested parties should be able to demonstrate their ability to perform these evaluations with only personnel that are U.S. citizens.  Finally, offerors should include an analytical comparison of their capability in terms of the services requested by this RFI.   

RESPONSES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SHOULD CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1) A 3-5 page summary of the contractor’s “relevant” prior work; 2) description of any potential conflicts of interest the offeror may have in performing the work, and insight and solutions to contractor firewalls and Organizational Conflicts of Interest as it relates to current efforts as well as services provided under future RFIs/contracts related to this program, 3) A brief description of the contractor’s quality control processes for deliverables; 4) references (names and contact information) for whom the contractor has performed similar work, 5) a one-page corporate summary including your web site, 6) a listing of any current negotiated GSA  schedule, government contract, or commercial pricing rates, and 7) a statement identifying if the offeror is a small business, 8(a) firm, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, or HUBZone firm.

This is a Request For Information announcement only. This is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission to this RFI nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

Written capability statements must be submitted no later than February 26, 2004 to:

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS HAS BEEN CANCELED DUE TO A REQUIREMENT CHANGE***

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Fluke Corporation for the acquisition of :
(1)	Reference Standard, P/N 732B (Qty. 3), 
(2)	Resistance Standard, P/N 742A-1 (Qty. 3), 
(3)	Resistance Standard, P/N 742A-10K (Qty. 4).
The primary use will be for Fleet Intermediate workload support.  The 732B is a precision reference and transfer standard of 10 volts and 1.018 volts used to verify voltage measurements of higher accuracy multi-meters and multi-function calibrators.  Accuracy for the 732B reference/transfer standard is 3ppm per year. The 742A-1 is a precision accuracy 1 ohm reference resistor with accuracy of 8ppm per year.  The 742A-10K is a 10,000 ohm reference resistor accurate to 4ppm per year.

The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of USC 2304(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 and under GSA Schedule GS-24F-1029B. A non-competitive procurement is being requested due to the required logistics costs the Navy would incur to verify/certify a new model number(s) and incorporate the new model number(s) into NAVAIR METCAL instrument calibration procedures. The above listed model numbers have been verified/certified for accuracy, drift, temperature correlation, voltage and power. 

Logistics support costs shall be considered in the overall cost to the Navy when introducing new model numbers. This is of particularly concern when the quantities of new items are low and the overall cost to the Navy would far exceed the actual cost of the unit.

<DESC>A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

The High Power Microwaves High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave and other directed energy systems via this Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research (DETAR) program.  The DETAR program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high power microwave (HPM) system and technology development.  The program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/DEH capital resources, facilities, and experience.  This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads, including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of such technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications, such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, and particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power.

In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D maintenance and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities.  Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory (Building 322), The High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML, Building 323), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF, Building 66071), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/DE (Building 963), portions of buildings in the Building 900 complex, and a new facility located on KAFB housing operations presently conducted at Sandia Area IV. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing, and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR).   As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive facilities maintenance and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.

The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49.9M over five years (FY05: $5-9.5M; FY06: $5-10M; FY07: $5-9.5M; FY08: $5-10M; FY09: $5-10.9M), and the resulting contract will be awarded with a ceiling of $49.9M.  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards.  This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area.  If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order.  If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

Technical Task Areas are described below.

1.  High Power Microwave Development:  

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW are of interest for the DETAR program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target.  The thrust of this activity is to identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 2 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.  This is an enabling technical task area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains.  Areas of research for this technical task area include the design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like.  A further area of investigation is expected to encompass the modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

B.  GENERAL INFORMATION.
The government anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee Task Order, completion contract(s) but reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposal.  The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified, and is expected to have a five-year ordering period.  In the event the government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, the government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror. If the offeror is a large business, any resultant contract will include a subcontracting plan, which must be submitted prior to award. In addition, AFMC 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause, will be applicable, with probable inclusion of Alternates III, IV, and VI.  The successful awardee will be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the AFRL/DEOS support contractor to permit administrative access to proposal and contract data.  Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.  It is expected that contractors may have access to, or generate, data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, offerors will need to be certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) prior to award. Contact the US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572), or logon to http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for further information on certification and the approval process.

Other FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs not discussed herein shall provide rationale in the proposal that research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that the research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 52.215-1(e).

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps seeks to meet the Expeditionary Assault Bridge (EAB) requirement for providing assault gap bridging capability on the battlefield.  The EAB will meet the gap crossing requirements of the Fleet Marine Force. The system will be used as a rapidly employable, short-gap, assault crossing system, capable of spanning natural and manmade obstacles up to 60 feet (18.29m) while under fire for up to Military Load Class (MLC) 70-ton vehicles.

The USMC is interested in sources that have the capability that can take an existing USMC MLC-70 ton “scissoring” bridges and USMC M1A1 chassis and integrate a launcher onto the platform.  The launcher must be able to deploy and recover the bridge.  The launcher must also be able to integrate onto a M1A1 chassis without degrading performance of the vehicle. The M1A1, with turret pulled, would be provided as Government Furnished Equipment.  In addition, the launcher must be developed, requiring minimal integration with USMC “scissoring” bridges.   It is important to note that the USMC is not interested in bridges at this time.  Our interest extends only to launchers that can be integrated with USMC “scissoring” bridges and USMC M1A1 chassis. The bridge to which we refer is in use on the Armor Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) presently fielded by Marine Corps and the U.S. Army.

All sources having the capability of meeting these requirements are requested to submit copies of relevant documentation in response to this Request for Information at no cost to the Government.  Written responses should be submitted not later than close of business 1 May 2004.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  The submission of the product information should not be construed as a commitment to procure equipment.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not a commitment by the USMC to procure subject equipment.  The Government is only seeking possible sources for future needs. There is no specific format or outline for sufficient descriptive literature and other pertinenet information to provide the fullest understanding of the system capabilities.  The Govenrment is not liable for any costs associated with the submittal of such vendor information.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  Responses should be submitted to the contact person listed above at Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CTQ6, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia requests capability statements for refurbishing a medium-sized anechoic chamber used for electromagnetic vulnerability testing.  It is requested that each potential supplier prepare a capability statement describing its ability to accomplish this task.  This capability statement should include a description of the absorber material addressing the listed requirements, a description of the company's ability for installation, performance evaluation, and certification of the absorber material, and any other suggestions for chamber improvement.  The capability statement should not exceed three pages.  Brochures are also welcome in addition to the capability statement.  Inclusion of pricing information is optional at this time.  All capability statements should be received within one month of the publication announ cement. BACKGROUND  The NSWC Anechoic Chamber is located in Building 150 on the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren Virginia. The chamber is constructed within a single, shielded RF enclosure. The Chamber is 18.26m (60'-0") long by 8.53m (28'-0") wide x 8.53m (28'-0") high.  The facility will be used for performing testing over the frequency range of 80MHz to 100GHz.  The chamber has a 36" X 84" personnel door and a large 24'-0" x 14'-0" equipment door.  Lighting is provided by 25 each, 90-watt halogen flood lamps that are situated above the ceiling absorber in equally spaced wave-guide beyond the cut off housings. The chamber has an existing fire sprinkler system with 50 heads exposed in the ceiling.  FREQUENCY RANGE SPECIFICATIONS  The NSWCDD anechoic chamber facility currently has a test range of 200MHz to 60GHz.  With the availability of new anechoic  materials, NSWCDD has the opportunity to extend this test range.  At a minimum, we would like to extend this test range down to 100MHz.  By extending the range to 100Hz, NSWCDD will have the ability to conduct low A-band EMV missile tests in the chamber.  This will save both time and money by removing the need to move the missile and equipment out onto the ground plane.  It will also provide a cleaner RF test environment.  We do not see a direct need to extend the upper bound above 60MHz.  However, if the choice arose to either extend the range above 60GHz or extend it below 100MHz, it would be more beneficial to NSWCDD to extend the range above 60GHz to enable high frequency testing in the future.  NEW ABSORBER MATERIAL PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION   Replace the existing absorber with new absorber to cover regions of the chamber floor, wall and ceiling as required.  At a minimum , this material shall provide suitable chamber performance from 100 MHz to at least 60GHz.  RF ABSORBER CHARACTERISTICS   a.  Safety: The absorber product must be manufactured from UL listed material  b. Mechanical characteristics: RF absorber must be able to support its own weight with a safety factor of 10.  c.  Fire test: RF absorber material must be compliant with UL 94HBF and NRL 8093 test 1,2,3.  d.  Toxicity: RF absorber must be non-toxic and shall not release any toxic fumes or particles.  CHAMBER STRUCTURE MODIFICATION   Repair to the chamber structure as required to support anticipated loading.  Changes to design/layout of chamber and its structure will be welcome.  WHEEL LOADING  The floor material shall meet the following requirements:  The floor material shall be able to support a cart whose total load is 3000 lbs.  Maximum total wheel load shall be 500 pounds per  tire.  No deformation in the flooring material will occur when load is applied.  VERIFICATION TESTING SHIELD EFFECTIVENESS TEST  Door Seals and Light fixtures will be shielded to meet industry standards and per NSA65-6/MIL STD 285.  SITE ATTENUATION  Site attenuation measurements shall be performed in accordance with ANSI C63.4 measurement procedures.  FIELD UNIFORMITY  Field uniformity measurements shall be performed in accordance with EN 61000-4-3. QUIET ZONE  The Quiet Zone Reflectivity measurements shall be done to define the Quiet Zone centered 14'-0" above the turntable located in the chamber.  WARRANTY  The Manufacturer shall provide the government with a minimum 15- year warranty for material and workmanship.   Interested suppliers must respond within thirty (30) days of this notice, referencing sources sought number N00178-04-Q-3024 to the Naval Surface Warfare Center  Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren,VA to NSWC Code XDS13-8, BUILDING 183 ROOM 106, 17320 DAHLGREN ROAD, DAHLGREN, VA 22448-5100.  E-mail xds13@nswc.navy.mil; Phone 540-653-7765; Fax 540-653-6810. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS NOR DOES THIS ADVERTISEMENT BIND THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTRACTING FOR ANY SUPPLIES.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE EVALUATED ONLY FOR TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.

BACKGROUND:  

The Inspector General Department of Defense (IG DoD) is currently implementing a long-range strategy to conduct audits of DoD financial statements. Agency financial statements are required by the Chief Financial Officer’s Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576), which mandates agencies prepare financial statements and subsequent audits of the financial statements. For a sample of financial statements and related reports, go to http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/03report.htm and select reports D-2003-050, D-2003-047, D-2003-042.

The Department’s financial statements must cover all accounts and associated activities of each office, bureau, and activity of each component within the DoD.  The IG DoD must verify the reliability of agency financial statements through the use of audits and other methods.  Currently, the Department’s financial statements are being developed using various financial management systems throughout the DoD.  The reliability of these systems directly impacts the DoD’s ability to produce reliable financial statements.  

The IG DoD is committed to increasing the resources devoted to auditing the financial statements, and the related financial management business activities.  The IG DoD’s strategy is intended to facilitate the Department’s commitment to improve financial management and attain auditable financial statements that support an unqualified opinion.  To accomplish this strategy, NAVAIR intends to issue a subsequent RFI to conduct CFO audits, Statement of Auditing Standards 70/88 Reviews of DoD Service Organizations, Assessment of DoD Financial Management Systems, Audit Readiness Assessments, and Remediation Plans.  Commercial sources may include but are not limited to Independent Public Accounting Firms (IPA’s) and Information Technology (IT) firms.  

SERVICES REQUIRED: 

Reliability Assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems 

Sources are sought to conduct reliability assessments of DoD Financial Management Systems including related operations, activities, functions, and processes, used to compile and prepare the DoD’s financial statements.  The assessments will also determine whether internal controls over financial reporting are in place and operating as intended.  

A reliability assessment is a preliminary evaluation to determine if an entity’s financial statements can withstand a full-scale audit and is a means by which to identify significant issues, if any, that may preclude the performance of a full-scale financial statement audit.  The specific services required for each type of assessment will be reflected in individual statements of work for each task order.

A performance work statement will be developed on a cases-by-case basis describing the technical requirements, and functional performance requirements and the nature and type of service(s) needed.

The reliability assessments, in some instances, must conform to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) [http://www.gao.gov/govaud/yb2003.pdf] and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards.  However, individual task orders with a limited objective may be issued that do not require compliance with GAGAS or the AICPA standards.  The IG DoD will monitor the contractor’s work through the use of periodic contractor reporting and ongoing access to contractor’s working papers.  The IG DoD will also determine whether the contractor’s work complies with GAGAS and that the work supports the assessment conclusions.  Task order contracts will be issued with variable performance timeframes reflected in each order.  It is envisioned that IPA or IT firms with IG DoD oversight can conduct the reliability assessments. 

Contract Objective(s).  The overall program objective is to determine whether various DoD financial statements, taken as a whole, are accurately presented in all material respects, and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Specifically, individually awarded task orders will determine the accuracy and reliability of various DoD Financial Management Systems, including related processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of agency financial statements.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

An interested party should be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, experience with evaluating information systems in terms of fulfillment of purpose, design efficiency, appropriate controls, data integrity, integration with external systems, and human interface.  NAVAIR-AD intends to award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required. Experience may include, both government and commercial work that the offeror has performed.  Demonstrated evidence may include, but not be limited to customer names and addresses, description of work performed/delivered, description of types/complexity of systems worked on, description of strategies to accomplish the work, description of communication strategies with the customer, and significant accounting and information technology issues resolved.  If applicable, highlight any work performed with accounting/financial management systems and/or government information systems (include contract numbers).  Interested parties should be able to demonstrate their ability to perform these evaluations with only personnel that are U.S. citizens.  Finally, offerors should include an analytical comparison of their capability in terms of the services requested by this RFI.   

RESPONSES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SHOULD CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1) A 3-5 page summary of the contractor’s “relevant” prior work; 2) description of any potential conflicts of interest the offeror may have in performing the work, and insight and solutions to contractor firewalls and Organizational Conflicts of Interest as it relates to current efforts as well as services provided under future RFIs/contracts related to this program, 3) A brief description of the contractor’s quality control processes for deliverables; 4) references (names and contact information) for whom the contractor has performed similar work, 5) a one-page corporate summary including your web site, 6) a listing of any current negotiated GSA  schedule, government contract, or commercial pricing rates, and 7) a statement identifying if the offeror is a small business, 8(a) firm, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, or HUBZone firm.

This is a Request For Information announcement only. This is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission to this RFI nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) desires the acquisition of a multi-purpose warhead for use on the 2.75 inch hydra rockets fired from SOF aviation platforms.   The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to qualify a multi-purpose warhead that is more effective against an array of targets to include buildings, bunkers and ships.   (1)  Penetration:  When mounted on a MK66 rocket motor and fired, the warhead will penetrate 24” of reinforced concrete and 4’ of timber/earthen bunkers.   (2)  Non-Developmental / In Service Status:  The multi-purpose warhead must be non-developmental and qualified by other allied (NATO) countries.  (3)  Mass/CG Flight Characteristics:  When mounted on a Hydra rocket motor, the warhead will have a similar mass and center of gravity when compared to the M229/M151 warhead to insure that no need to change supporting fire control instrumentation (weapon racks) or effect ongoing spiral developments (precision kill weapon system).  (4)  Incendiary Effect:  The multi-purpose warhead must provide an incendiary effect to create secondary fires after impact.  (5)  Training Warhead:  It is desired that the vendor provide an inert day/night warhead (to replace the M274) warhead that provides a visible hit signature.  The new warhead should not create UXO hazards. When deployed overseas, the new warhead should allowing SOF forces to conduct training on allied ranges without creating UXO hazards or creating in-advertent range fires.   (6)  Facilities, Expertise and Safety:    These warheads should meet stringent Navy WSRB requirements/standards.  All the cartridges should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (IM characteristics) and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. ** Responses to this market survey are due on or before 15 APRIL 2004, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 15 APRIL 2004.    Questions may be submitted in writing to LTC Wil Riggins at the above address or via email to riggind@socom.mil. Interested Parties who are willing to provide qualified cartridges at no cost for USSOCOM testing should so indicate in the submitted white paper.

<DESC>The CECOM Acquisition Center Washington is seeking sources on behalf of U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, Army Power Division for carbon dioxide (CO2) compressors suitability for testing by the U.S. Army for use in future Environmental Control Units (ECUs). T he U.S. Army requires advanced heating and cooling technology for a variety of equipment applications. One of these is the military family of Environmental Control Units (ECUs). High performance systems with reduced logistics support requirements and envir onmentally responsible working fluids are desired. Of specific interest is implementing technology for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The transcritical carbon dioxide cycle offers these possibilities. The U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, Army Power Div ision, is applying for approval from the Department of Defense to initiate the Foreign Comparative Testing Program for Transcritical CO2 Cooling and Heating Technology Compressors in Fiscal Year 2005. The Army intends to identify the 4 most promising forei gn (non-U.S.) compressor models and procure 2 of each for testing and evaluation. In addition, domestic compressor models will be considered for testing and evaluation. Technical requirements: (1) Capable of compressing CO2 gas for military cooling and hea ting applications; (2) Power type: 208V, 3-phase, 50/60Hz and/or 115V, single-phase, 50/60Hz; (3) Air Cooling outdoor temperature range: 32 deg F to 125 deg F (0 deg C to 51.7 deg C); (4) Range of desired cooling capacities at 125 deg F outdoor, 90 deg F/5 0%RH indoor: 6,000 Btu/h to 120,000 Btu/h (at 51.7 deg C outdoor, 32.2 deg C/50%RH indoor: 1.8 kW to 35 kW); (5) Heat Pump capability desired. The U.S. Army is interested in receiving white papers outlining the following: (1) Self-assessment (by the compre ssor manufacturer) of the technology maturity level -- find the Technology Readiness Table through the following website: http://akss.dau.mil/jsp/default.jsp; (2) Whether and where item is in commercial use; (3) Production rates (current and potential); (4 ) Technical data (e.g., rated cooling/heating capacity at industry/specified conditions, burst pressure, electrical power limit, etc.); (5) Test and evaluation data; (6) Terms offered for use of compressors by the U.S. Army in testing (no-cost loan, lease,  purchase, etc.), including cost estimates; (7) Terms offered for vendor support of this testing program (maintenance, repair, etc.), including cost estimates; (8) Unit cost or estimated cost for full production items; (9) Summary of related corporate expe rience; (10) Other data that may be useful for Army consideration. The most mature technology is desired. Most desired is in production. The next most desired is fully developed not in production. At a minimum, the compressor must be in development and wil l be fully developed by 30 March 2005. Emphasis will be placed on prospective sources with proven experience in building full-scale compressors for transcritical CO2 systems. There is no funding available to procure materials that meet the above requiremen ts at this time.  In addition, the government does not plan to pay for any information received from this RFI. The data received in response to this request for information (RFI) will be used for information purposes only and does not, in any way, mandate or impose requirements.  It is highly desirable for the government to receive unlimited rights to the data provided, however, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If this is the case, proprietary data must be  clearly marked as such  and separated  from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  Proprietary information will be protected.  White papers excluding test data shall not exceed 5 pages in length per compressor model; test data shall have no page  limit. White papers should be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at pat.davis@cacw.army.mil no later than close of business (4:00 pm EDST) on by 23 June 2004.  All requests for further information must be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought - Vulnerability Reduction and Protection Measures for Critical Assets and Infrastructures
<DESC>The Government anticipates contracting for technical and professional services to identify and evaluate vulnerabilities in the protection of buffer zone areas of an estimated 2,000 critical assets in the United States, and to provide recommendations on corrective actions to reduce those vulnerabilities.  The vulnerability assessment would address the susceptibility of critical assets to successful terrorist attack that make use of weaknesses in protection and monitoring of buffer zones near the critical assets.  The critical assets include various industrial, transportation, government, public, and other types of sites.  After the corrective actions have been identified, equipment valued at up to $50,000 per asset would be competitively procured and provided or installed by the contractor to assist owners of critical assets in reducing the vulnerabilities of their buffer zones. Organizations should identify specific states in the United States or regions within states where they could efficiently perform the anticipated work. Several regional contracts are anticipated with similar work scopes. The purpose of this announcement is to determine if there are small business firms or combinations of small business firms that have the requisite breadth and depth of experience and capabilities in the various technical, engineering, security, acquisition, business, and other disciplines that would be needed to successfully perform the broad range of tasks outlined above. Organizations deeming themselves qualified are requested to provide a brief description of their capabilities and experience in these or related areas so that the Government can determine the most appropriate acquisition strategy for satisfaction of this important requirement.  This request is not a solicitation for proposals but merely a request for information. Please limit your response to no more than five pages and provide your response by April 9, 2004 to U.S., Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory, P.O. Box 880, 3610 Collins Ferry Road, Morgantown, West Virginia 26507-0880 to the attention of Michael Knaggs, Mail Stop D04.

The contractor is responsible for their own supply and re-supply of ammunition.  Quantities and types of ammunition on hand must be approved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to disallow convoy movements if the preparation of the contractor is deemed inadequate.

The contractor is responsible for providing first responder medical care to its own personnel.  The contractor shall be given military medical care in the event of an emergency and is authorized to utilize the emergency medical frequency.

The contractor shall be paid based on the number of convoys escorted to final destination.  These prices shall be fixed price and not subject to redetermination.

<SUBJECT>--New Generation Army Targetry Systems (NGATS)- Request for Information from Industry
<DESC>The U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) and the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI) are developing a New Generation Army Targetry System (NGATS) to replace existing  target systems on live fire  ranges.  The NGATS will be made up of families of interchangeable targetry components that provide the required performance at a low life cycle cost. Current communication design methods utilize both the Ethernet (TCP/IP) and the RS-485 (HDLC) physical me dia (protocol). The Government desires a design change for use of only the Ethernet (TCP/IP) physical media and protocol. This change will require new message set implementation and may require data connector keying changes to Battlefield Effects Device (B ED) manufactures and Representation Device (RD) manufactures.  Seeking information from Industry regarding the impact this change may have on the current baseline or system configuration, the Government will accept industry input through March 31, 2004.  I ndustry input will assist the Government in making a final decision regarding the change.  Revised BED and RD device Interface Control Documents (ICDs), if required, will be released, no later than two weeks after the decision is made. Request the impact i nformation be sent to don.catlett@redstone.army.mil or steve_wright@peostri.army.mil

The Solicitation Number 2004-R-044 is issued as a RFQ.  The United States Senate Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) has identified a long-term requirement for approximately 80,000 to 100,000 square feet of warehouse space to accommodate multiple uses for Senate clients.  These uses include, but are not limited to, the following: Open rack general storage; Secured rack storage; and Store rooms, some with museum quality environmental controls.  To meet this need, the SAA wishes to consider an acquisition of an existing, modern warehouse building site within a 25-mile radius from the US Capitol, preferably in the District of Columbia or Prince Georges County.  The SAA will consider meeting this need through one of the following transactions: Purchase of an existing warehouse or Lease of an existing warehouse with an option to buy.  The United States Senate Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) requires the services of a commercial real estate specialist to perform a market survey to identify warehouse opportunities in the geographic area defined by the SAA and prepare written market survey reports to be submitted to the SAA for review and approval.

The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Marine Machinery Mechanics be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.    Any delay to a shipyard availability due to inferior services would be costly to the Government and is a primary consideration in the award and continuation of any resulting award.    The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic must have a careful knowledge of marine equipment assembly, installation, maintenance, repair, and adjustment.

Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum three (3) qualified Marine Machinery Mechanics and a Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.    Price Proposal: Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  CLIN 0001 – MARINE MACHINERY MECHANIC and CLIN 0002 - LEAD MARINE MACHINERY MECHANIC.    These rates shall include all costs to perform the required services.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours (1,200 hrs/Marine Machinery Mechanics, 180 hours Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Marine Machinery Mechanics is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Marine Machinery Mechanics/Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.    All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.   On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Machinery Mechanics are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Marine Machinery Mechanics and 30 for the Lead Marine Machinery Mechanic.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

The contractors shall provide consulting services as needed related to the implementation of the SIS Information Visualization plan and other tasks and projects associated with SIS responsibilities with respect to visualization.     Expertise in multimedia technologies and graphic design is required for this task.

QUESTIONS THAT WERE PRSENTED AT THE SITE VISIT ON 17 MARCH 04

1) Would it be possible to develop contacts with the building contractor so that we may seek the possibility of using them for the actual construction work?  (If they drill the holes, it wouldn't void their own warranty would it?)
Please refer to the Statement of Work of the request for proposal, para. 1  "...there will be no facility modifications (roof/wall penetrations) permitted." 
 
2) Would it be possible to get an extension on the RFP due date based upon time frames to coordinate due to question 1 and with the carriers to get their approval?
Closing date has been extended to 2 Apr 04. 
 
3) Who (if anyone) is coordinating this with the local carriers to get their 
permission to re-transmit their licensed frequencies?  Will that be the bidders
responsibility? 
Request bidders take care of this.
 
4) Will we be allowed to return to take signal strength measurements in Bldg
 1235?  Typically this is done after a bid is won and as a way to verify the design.
We will be available
 
5) Is the list of accepted bidders limited to those present at the site walk?
No
 
6) What are the performance metrics of the system for acceptance (if any)?
Performance metrics are clear reception of cellular phones within the facility.

7) I assume some kind of battery backup?  Is there a time requirement (i.e. 4
hours, 8 hours)?
No back-up is required. If the facility has no power, no one will be in side

<DESC>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS
SOLICITATION FSIS-17-B-04

1. How do you want this bid, time, per call, per month? Do you have any traffic statistics?

Please price per call and include pricing for each option year.  I have issued a amendment to the solicitation that will be posted by tomorrow to include this.

2. In the Combined Solicitation, it indicates that that contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, management, supplies to perform this service and that this is on an as needed basis. The solicitation further states that the contractor will respond within 4 hours of the BPA Call being made.  My questions are:
•	Will the contractor be required to integrate their equipment into the FSIS current system or will the contractor be required to have a separate number prepared for this? 
Must have a separate number.  No integration into FSIS system.
•	Will the contractors personnel be required on site at FSIS within 4 hours or does the contractor have to be ready to receive the calls within 4 hours?   Contractor will not be onsite.  Must receive calls at their own facility within 4 hours.

3. Would the Geographic location of the WA place our location outside of USDA geographical requirements?
 Is there any way for my county seat to pursue?  (I may have other options for this, but it never hurts to ask)?  Place of Performance for this requirement is at the contractor's facility.  Contractor does not have to be located in any particular location.
 
4. Sol# FSIS-17-B-04 indicates the size standard of $6,000,000.00 
applies to this procurement.

Is the $6,000,000.00 for the total blanket purchase award to 
cover ONLY 1 year at the above amount. Or to cover the 1 year and 
4 year option, if extended.

The size standard is the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates)may be to remain a small business for SBA's programs and for the Federal contracting programs.

This size standard would cover the entire period of the BPA (5 Years).


5.    Is the program outsourced today?  If so, are you at liberty to disclose who the provider is?  No 


6.      Are the numbers to be answered toll free (800) numbers?  If so, are they owned by the USDA?   No 


7.    Should we assume for quoting purposes that the USDA will maintain the cost of the 
800/longdistance service?  No 


8.  The answering service seems driven by information that might be released (either by the
government or by the media) that relates to a meat/poultry issue.  Based on the solicitation, it appears 
we’d need to have a general contact management system that records customer inquiries and 
provides appropriate responses based on the customer issue.  Is this correct?  USDA provides 
all information. Any and all information presented to consumers must be FSIS approved. 

9.  I know the call volume will vary, but do you have any historical reporting we could review to 
understand the spikes in volume?  We are estimating 200 to 500 calls per day 
maybe more. Contractor shall capacity to handle up to 2000 calls per day. 

10. What traditionally is the training timeframe for a representative? There is no established 
timeframe. 

11. Do you have an idea of how your decision will be made (i.e. how performance, approach and price would be weighted)?  We want to be sure to build our response to you appropriately.
 
As mentioned in the Solicitation, There are three evaluation factors:  1) technical capability to meet the Government; 2) past performance; 3) price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined are significantly more important than price.  

12. One more question that I thought of last night…………..is there any specific pricing format you are looking for? (i.e. pay by hour, pay by minute, pay by call?).  Just wanted to be sure we provide you back information in the proper format.

Yes - I just issued a amendment to the solicitation to add the following statement:
 
Pricing shall be given on a per call basis and include pricing for each option year.
 
13. Since pricing is to be based per call...what is the average length of the current call?  This would help us determine cost effective pricing since our actual cost is based on the time the operator is on the line with the caller.  A one minute call would obviously cost less than a five minute call, for example.
 
It varies depending on questions and issues involved. A call could last 3 or 4 minutes up to 15 or 20. some people have more than one question and sometimes one question leads to another. 
 
14. Is there a current contract in place?  No 

15. Will training be provided to the call center employees? 

This will operate in the same manner as the other times large recalls required we use an outsourcing call center company. The contractor had FSIS approved materials---press releases, Q&A’s, etc that the telephone agents used. They also had an approved recorded message on their system that consumers could listen to while they waited, if they chose, to listen to a live operator.  
These situations arise suddenly and there is no time to for USDA to “train” agents before they answer calls. The contractor can choose to do whatever they want with their existing staff as far as “training” goes. Call center telephone agents should have the basic telephone people skills necessary to deal with the public. I would assume since a contractor is bidding on this SOW, that they are already in the call center business and have permanent, full-time, qualified telephone agents.
 
16. Other than amendments, is there other documentation expected to be released?  No 

17. Is there a submittal package (SF1449, section "k", etc..) to return?  No, this is going to be a Blanket Purchase Agreement not a contract. 

18. Do we simply submit our pricing?  See Amendment 01 posted on Fedbizopps.  Pricing shall be given on a per call basis and include pricing for each option year. 

19. I have looked over the documents for the above Solicitation, and I would like to know why it is going to be issued on an as needed basis?  Will government workers be doing the work at all other times, or will Contractors only be needed when a government employee won't be available for that particular day? Can you explain why the winner of the procurement will not have someone working at all times?

We have Government Workers that handle the calls for our Hotline.  This BPA is being issued to cover us when we have a large emergency recall and we need help to handle the overflow of calls during that time.

20. Do you have any statistics on length of calls?

We estimate 200 to 500 calls per day and could be more.  Contractor shall have capability of handling up to 2000 calls per day.  Calls average about 3 to 4 minutes.
 
21.  The RFQ states that live operators and recorded messages must answer calls 24-hours/day, 7 days/week.  Does this requirement mean that both live operators and recorded messages must be available at all times?  The information on USDA's website about the hotline indicates that live operators are available from 10 am - 4 pm Eastern time on weekdays and from 8 am - 2 pm on Thanksgiving.  Automated messages provide information at all other times.

Yes, it requires that the contractor have live operators available 24 hours a day for 7 days a week along with a recorded message available when all lines busy.  Understand that this service is for emergencies only.

22.  Are there particular educational/experience requirements for hotline operators for this procurement?

No

23.  How often does the government anticipate issuing a BPA Call?  For example, do call patterns at the hotline lead the government to anticipate using this contract to handle overflows on a daily, weekly, monthly, etc. basis, and how long might a Call extend?  For example, we understand that call surges would come with the winter holidays; would a BPA Call during that time be made several times throughout that period, or would a Call be issued for November and December?  Another source of call surges requiring use of the contract would be for product recalls.  How does the government anticipate using the contract to handle such a surge - would the government expect to issue a Call every day as needed, or, upon hearing of a recall, anticipate a high-volume period of a week, two weeks, month, etc. and issue a Call for that period, ending or extending it as needed?

There is no way to determine frequency of services. The only time of the year there is a predictable increase of calls is Thanksgiving week.  USDA may or may not require overflow services at that time.  Requirement for service is on case-by-case basis.  There is rarely any advance notice of a large volume product recall and the duration of the service could be days or weeks and cannot be determined in advance.


24.  The RFQ indicates that during a BPA Call approximately 200-500 calls per day might be handled.  Does this include both calls requiring live operators as well as calls handled through automated messages?  If so, what is the anticipated breakdown of calls between live operators and automated messages?

Yes. This includes all calls.  There is no breakdown of calls between live operators and automated messages. That is random and determined by various factors including number of agents taking calls, number of telephone lines, duration of calls, length of message, time of day, day of week, scope of recall, etc.


25.  The RFQ indicates that during a BPA Call, the contract must have the capacity to handle up to 2,000 calls per day.  Again, does this include both calls requiring live operators as well as calls handled through automated messages?  If so, what is the anticipated breakdown of calls between live operators and automated messages?  How often would the government anticipate that the contractor might have to handle more than the average 200-500 calls per day (e.g., only around Thanksgiving; every time there is a recall, which occurs every one to two months; etc.)

See Answers above.

26.  How many minutes, on average, is a call that involves a live operator?

Consumer calls about general food safety questions may last 3 to 4 minutes on average. The length of call depends on the topic.  Some calls may last longer. It is important to note that the contractor will only be addressing food safety questions using only USDA approved materials (press release, Q&A's, fact sheets) as pertain to the reason for the outsourcing requirement such as a product recall.  The contractor will not be addressing general food safety questions but will refer those callers to the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline.

27.  What commercial items are we providing pricing for?  Each year as a lump sum?  Incremental increments of support time(i.e., hour, day, week, month), labor hours by category?

Per call basis and provide pricing for each option year.

28.  Would a BPA call ever occur outside of normal business hours?

Yes, it is possible.  This entire service is for use in emergency situations only.

29.  Where can we obtain the applicable wage determination?

You can access the Wage Determinations at website: www.wdol.gov/sca.aspx.  Click on Selecting SCA WDS.

30. Is the requirement for Spanish only applicable to the recorded messages, or does it apply as well to the live operators?

Yes, both  

31. Ms.Robertson, item (b) under the Statement of Work would 
suggest that the task is on a "will call" basis. The 
capacity is well defined. Should I assume the contractor 
must be in full swing within the (4) four hour call?

Yes. When the BPA Call issued you need to be ready to accept calls within 4 hours.

 
32. Is there any historical data available that would include busy hour reporting?  If so, may we receive a copy of it?
No
33. What is the average length of call?
3 to 4 minutes, but could be longer.
 
34.  Can the development costs be charged separately or are they to be included in the cost per call?
You can include in your proposal development costs as a separate cost and include if that cost is a one time cost or the cost would be a charge everytime we issue a call.  This will be considered during the evaluation process. 
 
35.  Regarding the four (4) hour response to the BPA Call, is it safe to assume the contractor will have four (4) hours to staff to handle 2,000 calls each day the BPA  Call is issued?
 
Yes
36.  Are the 200-500 calls per day subject to the four (4) hour BPA?
 
You will only receive calls after the BPA Call is issued.

37.  Are the 200-500 calls per day to be received seven (7) days a week?
Yes
 
38.  Is the BPA Call only for calls over the estimated 200-500 calls per day? 
The BPA Call will be issued when we need additional help to handle additional calls that we will probably receive after an emergency or large meat/poultry recall happens.  The contractor shall expect to receive 200 to 500 calls per day, possibly more.  We estimate up to 2,000 calls per day.

39. Are the 200-500 calls to be taken after the regular office hours of 8-4? 
The calls are to be taken during regular and after office hours.

40. Is there an incumbent vendor?  If so, who is it?  No

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

Project Description

The Government of Georgia envisions the construction of a highway that would connect the four principal transit points for goods and people traveling across the South Caucasus: Sarpi, on the Black Sea near the border of Turkey and Georgia; Poti, one of Georgia’s major seaports; Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia; and Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital, located on the Caspian Sea.  The Government of Georgia believes that a feasibility study is needed that can identify current traffic patterns and volume, and estimate the potential growth if a highway were to be constructed (for both transit of goods and people).  The highway would provide a way to move shipping containers that come across the Caspian to Baku from Kazakhstan or Turkmenistan, and transporting them across the Caucasus down to Turkey, or across the Black Sea to Ukraine or Eastern Europe.

It is expected that the new road would reduce the time and cost of transportation from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea and vice versa.  The road conditions overall in the Caucasus are poor and the highway would greatly assist in facilitating transportation in the area.  A highway currently exists that connects Sarpi to other markets in Turkey, and the proposed South Caucasus Highway would connect to this highway in order create an improved transportation corridor between Turkey and the Caucasus.

The Government of Georgia has indicated that it would welcome an independent highway authority to manage the highway, and that the authority should comprise representatives from the host countries, Azerbaijan and Georgia.  The DM will be asked to evaluate the proposed plan for setting up this authority.  As part of its review process, the DM will also be asked to look at any previous studies that exist on constructing parts of the proposed highway, and to examine demand at the ports of Baku and Poti to verify that there is a need for this highway to transship goods across the Caspian to the Black Sea and vice-versa.

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

  As host to the world’s largest natural gas reserves and eighth largest oil reserves, and as the largest exporter of gas and second largest exporter of oil, Russia plays a central role in today’s world energy markets.  In the last few years, Russia’s economy has been fuelled primarily by oil and gas sales that stem from increased domestic production and higher oil prices.  The Russian government has stated as a priority to diversify its economy and liberalize its energy sector, while private and oil gas companies seek to expand in a liberalized market place.  As the world’s oil consumers seek to diversify their sources of oil and gas from the Middle East, international focus on and interest in Russian energy policy and infrastructure has increased substantially. 

On a recent visit to Moscow, USTDA officials met with project sponsors about potential USTDA participation in several oil and gas projects.  These projects include:  construction of a new oil pipeline to Murmansk and construction of an export facility there; construction of a new pipeline that would carry refined oil products to Primorsk; construction of an ethylene plant in Kazan; and construction of a gas processing plant near the Tomsk petrochemical plant.

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s);

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

Afghanistan has one of the weakest telecommunications systems in the world.  Immediately after the fall of the Taliban, only one out of every 625 Afghans had access to telephone service, yielding a “teledensity” of 0.16 telephone lines for every 100 people.  This level is far below the developing country average of 2.6 lines per 100, and well below the World Bank’s targets for effectively stimulating economic growth.  The use of ICT is similarly underdeveloped.  The pent up demand for such services is however huge. Currently two cell phone systems are offering limited service in Kabul and the MoC has ambitious plans for developing the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.  As this infrastructure is improved, opportunities to make use of ICT will emerge.  As this is an essential component for the development of a modern economy, USTDA has been supporting these efforts and previously provided an advisor to the MoC and funded a FS on a Telecommunications Backbone in Afghanistan.  This DM would therefore scope out the MoC request for assistance with the tendering of the Telecommunications Backbone and identify other ICT project opportunities.

USTDA previously provided a grant of $280,081 to the MoC for a FS on the construction of a Telecommunications Backbone in Afghanistan.  This FS was recently completed by Alcatel USA, which was chosen for the FS through a competitive selection process.  Currently, no telecommunications backbone exists in the country.  Some switches were installed in the 1960’s but these have either been destroyed or are in a very poor condition.  At the moment Afghanistan is using VSAT links to connect cities, but this is a stopgap measure that is not tenable in the longer term.  The FS Report recommends the construction of a fiber optic ring connecting the country’s major cities.  Ideally the telecommunications backbone will be built in conjunction with the construction of the ring road currently underway.  The FS recommends that the primary means of installation be buried conduit cable, but provides for a variety of construction options and contemplates the use of microwave technology where mountainous terrain makes it necessary.  As conceived, this would result in a 2,476 km fiber optic ring connecting Afghanistan’s five major cities; Kabul; Kandahar; Heart; Mazar e Shariff; and Baglan.  When completed, the backbone would be capable of serving as a telecommunications backbone for approximately 90% of the country’s population. 

The FS report foresees a phased program of capital expenditure to build the telecommunications backbone, with outlays of $28,000,000 in year one, $22,000,000 in year two, and $25,000,000 in year three.  The FS prepared a business plan with a 15-year outlook that projected that the project would pay for itself within seven years and produce an internal rate of return of 27%.  Based on these results the FS concluded that the project could be financed and held the potential to attract private partners. 

The MoC considers the implementation of the Telecommunications Backbone project to be a priority.  While the MoC has proven to be a productive partner on USTDA projects, they continue to operate with a staff that has a severely limited capacity.  The MoC has therefore requested USTDA’s assistance in the tendering process for this project.  Further, there is a pent up demand for ICT services in both the private sector and the Afghan government.  As the telecommunications infrastructure develops, the potential to provide such services will emerge.  This DM will therefore scope out the MoC’s request for assistance with the Telecommunications Backbone tender and identify other potential ICT projects for USTDA’s consideration.  As this is a time sensitive project, the Contractor will be expected to perform the work expeditiously.

13. Presently, the autopilot/FD will only function from the left side instruments. The right side displays GPS in only the number 1 RMI. We would like to be able to select which instruments, left or right, provide AP instructions, which Navigational system feeds the AP and be able to display/use any navigational signal (Garmin 430, 530, VHF) from either pilot position. Simply put, when performing a GPS approach, we want the GPS signal from one GPS NAV system to display on the left side and the signal from the second GPS to display on the right side. The same goes for localizer and VOR signals. The pilots should be able to control the AP from either a central location or from their respective pilot positions. We want the capability to select which GPS or VHF Navigation and which side pilot or co-pilot instruments it will be displayed.
14.	Contractor will remove wiring from the removed equipment that is not utilized for the new equipment.
15.	Audio panels will provide communication inputs for the GNS530/430, UHF and HF radios.
16.	All existing antennas that are compatible will be retained.
17.    If there is not an "altitude select" (will instruct the auto-pilot to level off at a pre-selected altitude) that is compatible with our autopilot? If not, then we will use the AMS 2000 as a stand alone. 
Garmin Avionics was selected for the following safety reasons:

The Garmin Avionics system enhances the safety of passengers and crew by allowing the display of information within easy sight of the pilots. Presently, the navigation, communication and Art Traffic Control selectors and information are placed to the center and rear of the cockpit. This forces the pilots to have to turn around and situate their heads in such a way that normally leads to vertigo or loss of spatial awareness. This loss of awareness has been a contributing factor in aircraft mishaps. This will enhance the safety of the passengers and crew by relocating the navigation, Radio communications and Air Traffic control transponder from the lower console between the pilots to the instrument panel. This will allow the pilots to operate their navigation and communications radios without having to look away to change frequencies.
The Garmin system has a color-moving map with detailed and high quality definition of man made obstacles, terrain features and Air Traffic control designated airspace. This display allows for continuous situational awareness. This feature is very important since our mission profile takes us from high-density large airports to small remote unfamiliar airfields within the same flight.
 The Garmin system was selected due to the fact that it is the only one of its type and size that will provide all systems to be relocated to the instrument panel due to the lack of available space to accommodate additional systems.
The Garmin system combines GPS navigation, VHF communication, VHF navigation and color moving map into one digital unit.
We will evaluate any other Brand that encompasses these features.
We reserve the right to not award contract on this solicitation.
We will provide a copy of any Technical data, wiring diagrams, documentation to the contractor that we have.
The offeror shall include information regarding scheduling, performance time and lead time on this requirement.
