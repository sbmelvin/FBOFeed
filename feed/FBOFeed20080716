<DESC><p>This accouncement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action. The 655th AESS Squadron intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company for the commerical modifications to the existing mission communication system (MCS) on four C-32A and four C-40B aircraft. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. It is anticipated that the contract award will be made as a delivery order (or delivery order modification) to the existing indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract F33657-01-D-0013. The Government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one known responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements, and will be supported by an approved Justification and Approval. Boeing owns the data rights for these aircraft, and is the only contractor that can modify the leased aircraft. All the aircraft must have the same configuration to minimize cost, avoid duplication of effort and optimize supply chain requirements. The communication equipment are to be purchased from The Boeing Company as Government Furnished Property. This proposed contract action anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract.</p>
<p><br />Dollar Amount: $82,000,000</p>
<p><br />For subcontracting Opportunities, small business may contact The Boeing Company, Attn: Mr. Andrew Ackerman at (206) 655-8858 or via email <a href="mailto:andrew.j.ackerman@boeing.com">andrew.j.ackerman@boeing.com</a></p>

<DESC>The work involves improvements to the CAP Link pipeline access road and to Campus Drive under Interstate 19.  Drainage crossings along the access road have eroded the roadway and have made the road impassable in several locations.  Improvements will provide all-weather crossings along the roadway for pipeline maintenance vehicles.
Campus Drive under the Interstate 19 bridge currently ponds water during inclement weather and prevents farm personnel and public from accessing facilities east of Interstate 19.  The underpass is also too low to pass large farm equipment to fields on the east side of Interstate 19.  The improvements will provide a hard all-weather surface and will drain water away from the underpass.  The new roadway will be lowered such that farm equipment can pass without damaging the bridge structure or farm equipment. 

The Product Service Code is Z222,  NAICS Code is 237310, Sized Standard is $31.0 Mil, and the SIC code is 1611.  The Solicitation documents will be available on or about August 4, 2008.

STATEMENT OF WORK<p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking small business concerns for vendors to provide technical assistance in extracting information about FDA’s field inspection and feed sampling activities and summarizing data on the occurrence of microbial, mycotoxin, and pesticide contaminants in animal feeds.<p>

I. Introduction and Background<p>

The Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM) Division of Animal Feeds is responsible for planning and coordinating field inspection and feed sampling activities under the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program (FCCP). This involves summarizing the results of FCCP feed samples collected and analyzed for the presence of such contaminants as pesticides, dioxins, mycotoxins. E. coli 0157.H7, Salmonella, heavy metals and other toxic elements, which are recorded in the FDA's Field Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking Systems (FACTS) database.<p>

II. Description of Work<p>

The contractor shall provide technical assistance in extracting information about FDA's field inspection and feed sampling activities and summarizing data on the occurrence of microbial, mycotoxin, and pesticide contaminants in animal feeds. These data are obtained from FACTS database as part of the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program. Specifically, the contractor shall extract the results of microbiological analyses of animal feed samples during 2008 and the first 6 months of 2009 from FACTS and summarize the information on excel spreadsheets. The contractor shall also extract results of mycotoxin analyses of feed samples during 2008 and the first 6 months of 2009, and prepare special assignment reports towards the end of 2008. The contractor shall also analyze and prepare reports of feed samples collected under three special assignments in the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program. The contractor shall conduct quality assurance reviews of all final reports. The contractor shall work at his/her office and at CVM (7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20885), as appropriate.  No equipment will be provided for the contractor at his/her office. When the contractor works at CVM, he/she will have access to a computer and printer owned by the Division of Animal Feeds; there is no cost to the agency associated with providing the contractor access to this computer because it is also used by other employees in the Division of Animal Feeds. There are no specific hours during which the contractor needs to work; instead, work hours depend on the availability of information in the FACTS database and specific requests made to the contractor by the Project Manager.<p>

III. Deliverables<p>

EVALUATION FACTORS<p>

Project: Summarizing Data on Microbes and Mycotoxins in Animal Feeds.  The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical approach, understanding the scope of work, personnel, past performance factors, management plan and cost/price factors.

<DESC>The intention of this notice is to inform the contracting community that the Government intends to enter into a sole source contract for advisory services with Planetree, Inc., 130 Division Street, Derby, Connecticut, 06418 as described herein.The VA Medical Center located in Battle Creek, Michigan (BCVAMC) intends to procure advisory and assistance services to improve patient and employee satisfaction within the BCVAMC. The government's mission is improving the operation of the BCVAMC, the environment of care offered to veteran patients, overall patient satisfaction, and employee satisfaction by utilizing an outside source experienced in patient centered care.  The patient centered care concept is an innovative approach designed to address and improve the quality of care and satisfaction of veteran patients utilizing the medical center.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, requires onsite and telephone advisory sessions, proven patient centered techniques, space planning and architectural improvement assistance, data collection and analysis, patient education about treatments and services, consultations with BCVAMC medical staff concerning environment of care, staff education and training, leadership development retreats, and detailed project management plans outlining the assistance to be provided.   Patient satisfaction improvement strategies (to include staff and patients) shall include focus groups, pre and post implementation satisfaction surveys and monitoring, post discharge patient satisfaction polling, and informative literature to assist patients in becoming more involved with their medical care.Through extensive market research the Government was not able to identify vendors with suitable past experience in providing the full complement of advisory services required, with the exception of Planetree, Inc. As a result, the government intends to award a contract to Planetree, Inc for these services on a sole source basis. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), agencies are permitted to utilize this authority contingent upon a reasonable basis existing that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure as a sole source the brand LSR 11 4 Laser Flow Cytometric System with BD Biosciences Inc.; 2350 Qume Drive; San Jose, CA 95131.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-80123-MM on all correspondence.</p>
<p>Part I: Background information and description of requirements:</p>
<p>The Metabolism Branch supports a large program of basic and clinical research involving patients with malignancies of the immune system.  This work includes the development of new patient therapies which involves not only the study of individuals enrolled in clinical trials but also toxicity studies in subhuman primates and models of human disease developed in mice.  Such studies require the ability to isolate and evaluate specific subsets of circulating hematopoietic cells based on the phenotypic expression of their cellular receptors and cytokines.  The identification of these cellular populations involves flow cytometric analysis capable of detecting eight fluorescent parameters simultaneously on a single cell, a capability which we currently do not have.  This instrument will provide the capacity to monitor as many as ten fluorescent signals simultaneously.  In addition, the UV laser configured in this instrument will enable NCI to extend our studies to include critical monitoring of calcium mobilization in live cells following cytokine stimulation. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure the brand name BD Biosciences model LSR 11 4 Laser Flow Cytometric System or equal.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>Statutory Authority</p>
<p>Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501(a)(1).</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>The NCI's current flow cytometric patient studies are analyzed using three existing BD Bioscience instruments in our Branch.  It is essential that the new, upgraded 4 laser instrument be compatible with the existing instruments both in hardware technology and software for data analysis in order to insure comparability between previous and future critical patient studies.  Such data acquisition software is proprietary to the individual manufacturer and cannot be used with instrumentation from different companies.  In addition, several of our research collaborators also use the LSR11 system which will provide the ability to exchange and analyze data on a unified platform.  For these reasons it is essential that BD Biosciences be the sole source contractor for the purchase of this 4 laser flow cytometric system.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply to the LSR II:</p>
<p><br />1) Solid-state 488nm blue laser to detect FSC and SSC scatter parameters and FITC/Alexa 488, PE, PerCPCY55, and PECY7 fluorochromes or dyes (4 colors)</p>
<p>2) Red laser to detect APC and APCCY7 fluorochromes or dyes (2 colors)</p>
<p>3) Violet laser to detect Pacific Blue and Am cyan fluorochromes or dyes (2 colors)</p>
<p>4) UV laser to detect INDO 1 BLUE and INDO 1 Violet/DAPI fluorochromes or dyes (2 colors)</p>
<p>5) LSR 11 XW4600 workstation bundle with two 19 inch LCD monitors for digital data acquisition allowing for inter and intra beam compensation and the ability to threshold on any parameter</p>
<p>6) Appropriate dichroic mirrors and bandpass filters configured to detect the above indicated scatter patterns, fluorochromes, or dyes</p>

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Hamilton, MT, has a requirement for the operation of the Glassware Unit at RML.  Contractor will furnish all necessary supervision and labor to operate and maintain the Glassware Unit at RML, Hamilton, MT.  The glassware department is a fully equipped unit containing adequate counters, sinks, automatic washing machines, autoclaves and drying ovens.  All utilities, equipment, and supplies needed to perform the tasks encompassed by this contract will be supplied by the Government.  The work includes all management, supervision and labor necessary to receive soiled laboratory glassware and plastic ware from 5 research laboratories, segregating, cleaning, processing and returning the cleaned items to designated “pickup shelves” or to stock shelves.  Items cleaned or processed by the unit are a broad variety of laboratory glassware, plastic ware and instruments, some of which are small and/or very delicate and require special handling.  A sampling of the items is as follows: bottles, jars, aspirator jugs, pipettes, tubes, caps, Petri dishes, flasks, beakers, volumetric, graduated cylinders, magnetic stirring bars, syringes, surgical instruments, etc., and thus there is considerable hand work involved.  Great care must be exercised by all staff in the glassware unit to be very thorough and conscientious in performing their work to exaction standards.  Failure to do so could result in erroneous or inconsistent results in the experiments performed in the laboratories.  A fixed price contract for these services is contemplated.  NIAID intends to award a one year contract beginning on November 1, 2008 with the option for four additional contract years.  The Request for Proposals is expected to be issued on or about August 1, 2008.  Questions should be submitted in writing to Contract Specialist Amber Harris at harrisam@niaid.nih.gov.

Description

PROJECT NOTICE

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a Division of Midwest Research Institute, which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC36-99GO10337 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a Design-Build subcontract for design and construction of a laboratory and office facility called the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) project. The ESIF will be located at NREL’s South Table Mountain site in Golden, Colorado. The ESIF is envisioned to be the NREL and DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE) and DOE Golden Field Office (GFO) signature building at NREL for energy technology integration research and engineering and is a high visibility project of national scope. It is intended that the ESIF construction final completion be no later than September 2011. The firm fixed price with award fee for the design-build effort will be negotiated prior to subcontract award and is currently estimated to be approximately $70,000,000 to $75,000,000 of which approximately $22,000,000 is associated with equipment procurement and installation.  A majority of the funding has been secured for this project.     

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The ESIF will provide the research, engineering, design, testing and analysis of components and systems to enable economic, reliable integration of renewable electricity generation, fuel production, storage, and building efficiency technologies with the U.S. fuels and electricity delivery infrastructures. The ESIF will also include a state-of-the-art high performance computing and data center. It will support improved and expanded capabilities in modeling and simulation of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies and their integration into the existing energy infrastructure.  The ESIF will provide laboratory and research capabilities for a broad range of renewable energy generation capabilities to include:
•	Solar – Interconnection, Power electronics, Building Integration and system optimization
•	Buildings- Sensors & Controls, PV and other systems integration, Modeling and Simulation
•	Hydrogen – Electrical interfaces, Electrolyzers, Storage, Standards, Fueling Systems, Fuel Cell Integration
•	Wind – Models, wind generation and grid interaction, grid analysis
•	Vehicle Technologies – Hybrids and vehicle to grid integration, battery thermal management, power electronics
•	Biofuels – Generator sets and Engines
•	Energy Storage – Electrical and thermal
	
To accomplish this research, the ESIF will provide space for engineering, testing, optimization, and verification research needed for integrated energy systems.  It will accommodate a high performance computational capability of a minimum of 100 Teraflops with a planned expansion capability of 1000 Teraflops in future years.  It is NREL’s intention to procure the computer separately, therefore, the computer itself will not be purchased under this planned subcontract.  To support the research the ESIF will include offices and shared areas to support a constant staff of approximately 200 personnel and include special spaces such as: conferencing capabilities, guest offices, and other “institutional” spaces that facilitate collaboration between NREL/DOE’s private, academic, and public sector partners.  In addition, outdoor pads will be provided for testing larger equipment and systems up to the multi-megawatt scale. 

The ESIF is required to be a showcase of sustainable high-performance design that will demonstrate the integration of high performance building design and practices, showcase technology advances and capture industry’s attention for renewable and energy efficient technologies for this type of facility.  The ESIF is required to incorporate the best in energy efficiency, environmental performance, and advanced controls using a “whole building” integrated design approach and must comply with Energy Star standards.  In support of the Department of Energy’s goal to demonstrate energy efficient buildings with a lower impact on the environment the facility itself will be designed to merit at least a LEED “Gold” rating from the U.S. Green Building Council, which will be the highest certified facility of its type with a high performance computing data center as a major part of the building.  

To support NREL’s mission, the facility anticipates having the following features:

•	Approximately 20 - 30 laboratories and research areas of various sizes each with different missions, construction requirements and operational hazards.  To support this effort the design-build contractor will need to be proficient or have subcontract expertise in electrical distribution system design; hydrogen production, delivery and storage; high performance computing and energy efficient data centers; and electrical, electromagnetic and vibration isolation and control methods.
•	A high performance computing and data center capability that has sufficient room to support the computer as stated above, all periphery equipment, and enough space to allow for a future, redundant 1000 Teraflop computer.
•	Approximately 5 outdoor and roof top test pads that will be integrated into the building for testing and monitoring purposes.
•	Approximately $22 Million of research equipment that the Design-Builder will be required to have experience in so as to procure and install the following:
&#61607;	Electrical and Grid simulators (wind turbine, PV, utility grid)
&#61607;	Electrical distribution test circuit 
&#61607;	Hydrogen Research equipment (fuel cell, dispenser, compressors, electrolyzers, storage)
&#61607;	Test Pads and Test Cells (roof mounted and ground based photovoltaic , vehicle chamber) 
&#61607;	Load banks and test busses (AC, DC, Motor load) 
&#61607;	Other (surge tester, electrical sources, dynamometer, metrology equip, etc.)


PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS

NREL has determined that design-build firms must be prequalified to submit a proposal for this project.  Prequalification will be determined by NREL’s panel review of the information submitted in response to this Pre-solicitation Notice, in accordance with the technical criteria provided below.  NREL will establish a short list of approximately three firms determined to be most qualified to perform the project successfully.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the acquisition of MEO Subcontracting Support for Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC). In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 (revised), Performance of Commercial Activities, a public-private competition for Pay, Personnel and Passenger Transportation services has been announced. In order for the Agency Tender Official (ATO) to effectively compete with private industry and in light of the fact that the military billets under study will be reprogrammed to other functions and not be available to be part of the MEO, it has been determined that it is in the government’s best interest to obtain an MEO Subcontractor to assist with creating the resulting agency tender. If the government wins the A-76 competition, the MEO Subcontractor would then commence performance for those functions it proposed to perform in the initial agency tender offer. These services may include, but are not limited to: Maintain enlisted service records for personnel assigned to supported command and activities, process permanent change of station (PCS) and temporary additional duty (TEMADD) orders per MILPERSMAN, maintain officer and enlisted military pay account for personnel assigned to supported commands and activities, prepare transactions by utilizing current Personnel/Pay input system to report pay actions as required by pertinent directives, provide technical direction and advice regarding transportation entitlements, eligibility, and arrangements, and process passport and visa applications for official travel. Services may be performed at approximately 80 installations throughout CONUS, Hawaii and Guam. It is intended to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract under which task orders shall be issued. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will consist of two phases. Phase I tasking will consist of the MEO subcontractor working with the ATO to develop an offer design for the resultant agency tender offer. The Offer Design will detail the functions/tasks the MEO Subcontractor will perform as part of the overall AT MEO solution, locations at which those functions/tasks will be performed, estimated number of FTE to perform those functions and a rough order of magnitude of costs associated with performance of those functions If the government wins the A-76 competition, Phase 2 will consist of the MEO Subcontractor performing those Pay, Personnel and Passenger Transportation functions it proposed to perform in the initial agency tender offer. It is anticipated that Phase 2 will consist of a phase-in period, an eight month base period and four, one year option periods. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 561110. This acquisition will be conducted as an unrestricted, full and open competition. The RFP shall require the submission of a technical proposal as well as a price proposal. RFP N00189-08-R-Z057 will be made available electronically, upon its release, at http://www.neco.navy.mil on or around 29 August 2008. All contractors must be registered (http://www.ccr.gov) in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), Protection and Health Affairs Acquisition Division (PHAAD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a Risk Analysis Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of DHS Strategies for Risk Modeling and Analysis.  This is not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. 

The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 is the specified source that has been authorized by statute to provide these services.  Congress, as part of fiscal year 2008 appropriation statute appropriated funds to the DHS, Office of Risk Management and Analysis to enter into a contract with NAS “to review the Department’s approach to measuring risk, as discussed in the House report”, specifically House Report 110-161.  Executive Order 12832 authorized DHS to procure services from NAS on a non-competitive basis because of its unique qualifications to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report those matters to the Congress or any other agency of the Federal Government.   
 
Proposed study includes: (1) evaluating the quality of the DHS current approach to measuring risk, through review of a sample of models and methods; (2) assessing the capability of DHS risk analysis methods to appropriately represent and analyze risks from across the Department’s spectrum of activities and responsibilities; (3) assessing the capability of DHS risk analysis methods to support DHS decision-making; (4) reviewing the feasibility of creating integrated risk analyses  that covers the entire DHS program areas, including both terrorist threats and natural disasters; (5) making recommendations for best practices, including outreach and communications; (6) providing recommendations on how DHS can improve its risk analyses and (7) how those analyses can be validated. 

It is anticipated that the proposed period of performance for the risk analysis study will require fifteen (15) months for completion.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-5 entitled “Authorized or required by statute.”  Executive Order 12832 authorizes procurement of services from NAS on a noncompetitive basis when a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that NAS, because of its unique qualifications, can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department’s or agency’s program requirements.  

Therefore, based on the aforementioned facts and the statutory authority at FAR 6.302-5, the Government intends on make a single non-competitive award to the NAS after July 31, 2008.

<p>DISA is seeking information from industry on companies capable of providing a broad spectrum of strategic IT support, including: IT research, IT planning, IT management support, IT benchmarking and measurement, assisting with the development of Metrics, cost modeling support, and IT advisory services.</p>
<p>DISA is considering setting this opportunity aside for small business. Small businesses, specifically Women-Owned, HUBZONE, and Service-Disabled Veteran Own, are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI, in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, competition, and technical capabilities within the small business community to provide the required services.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>We at Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) imagine and envision a world in which information is virtual and on demand with global reach. Information is protected by identity based capabilities that allow users to connect, be identified, and access needed information in a trusted manner. It is a world in which United States military forces can deploy and connect no matter where they are located, pull information needed for their missions, and be given timely, accurate information on any threats they may face. It is a world with no seams between the sustaining base and the tactical edge so that operational agility is enabled. It is a world in which the United States military can freely exchange information routinely with coalition partners and others responsible for the security and defense of the United States. The technology employed is agile, adaptive, and capabilities-based. And, we imagine and envision a world in which our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are equipped with capabilities and services that are state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>As such, DISA has a requirement to obtain independent, third party consultative and advisory services without institutional biases, downstream business or political interests, or pre-existing organizational alignment.

The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Evaluation Factors:  Operational Effectiveness  Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in the Performance Specification for the RPA. Key features to address include Technical Compliance with Specification, Ruggedization, Size and Weight, and Value Added Features.  Supportability - Key Supportability issues to address include Durability, Technical Data, and Warranty.  Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:  (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important.  (ii) Supportability  Less important.  (iii) Past Performance - Least important. Price will be evaluated.  The Government will calculate an evaluated price for each offerors proposal by adding together all CLINs against an evaluated quantity.  Award shall be made to the offerors whose proposal presents the best value to the Government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical, supportability, and past performance merit being of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  Failure to meet each and every requirement will automatically disqualify an offeror from consideration for contract award.  The Government will utilize the PS to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each offeror's technical solution.  Value Added features, as listed by the Government or proposed by the offeror will be factored in.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.

The Army plans to engage in a dialogue with all interested sources that are willing to make such an investment, and will share information with them regarding historical requirements, pricing information, and anticipated future demands.  Additionally, if requested and available, the Army will furnish to domestic business concerns a sample item for possible reverse engineering  in accordance with the DoD Replenishment Parts Purchase or Borrow Program set forth at DoD Directive 4140.5.  It is anticipated that, after an initial technical exchange, future meetings will be scheduled, as appropriate, to review progress made towards reaching a solution to the Governments parts obsolescence problem(s) and discuss any changes in the Armys anticipated future requirements. <BR>3.	What is envisioned is an ongoing technical dialogue, which will culminate when the interested source has reached a solution that it believes is mature enough to meet one of the obsolescence problems identified by the Army.    <BR>4.	This effort would be an investment by the interested source, unfunded by the Army, and multiple sources may be making similar investments and performing efforts addressing the same obsolescence problem(s) in parallel.   Accordingly, either party can cease the effort at any time and for any reason.  No fiscal obligation will be created by this arrangement between the parties. <BR>5.	Each source wishing to engage the Army in such an effort will be asked to execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in the attached format.<BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR><BR>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)<BR>Reverse Engineering to Address Parts Obsolescence (REAPO) Program<BR><BR>Purpose:   The REAPO Program is a mechanism for identifying solutions for parts obsolescence problems encountered during the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems life cycles.  The Army is seeking to identify interested sources willing to make an independent investment directed towards finding a solution to any or all of these problems.   <BR><BR>Parties: <BR><BR>"	The Armys Team C4ISR, represented by the REAPO Program Coordinator, Mr. _________________________________ <BR><BR>"	________________________ (Insert the name of the participating source), referred to herein as the Program Participant, represented by __________________________. <BR><BR>Provisions:<BR><BR>1.	Team C4ISR and the Program Participant understand that the Army is not funding this effort and that the only mechanism under which the Program Participant might recover its investment would be as an indirect cost associated with a future contract, if one is awarded..<BR><BR>2.	On written notice, either party may terminate this MOU for any reason.<BR><BR>3.	The Army does NOT commit that it will make any future purchases as a result of this effort, and if an acquisition does result from efforts accomplished under this MOU, the Army will utilize whatever procurement mechanism (i.e., sole source, competitive, or utilizing socio-economic programs) it deems appropriate. <BR><BR>4.	The Army plans to engage in a dialogue with all interested sources that are willing to make such an investment, and will share information with them regarding historical requirements, pricing information, and anticipated future demands.  Additionally, if requested and available, the Army will furnish to domestic business concerns, a sample item for possible reverse engineering in accordance with the DoD Replenishment Parts Purchase or Borrow Program set forth at DoD Directive 4140.57, dated 30 May 2008.  The parties will arrange for periodic program reviews, as appropriate, during which the Program Participants progress will be reviewed, and updated Army information will be provided to the Program Participant. <BR><BR>5.	 When the Program Participant believes it has reached a solution to the subject obsolescence challenge, it shall propose the solution to the Army, and include, along with all technical performance characteristics associated with the approach (e.g., weight, power draw, bit error rate, etc), an economic order quantity analysis,  a hypothetical deliver schedule, identification of any business arrangements, particularly exclusive arrangements, the participant may have with any other business entity related to the ultimate production of the proposed solution, so that the Government can evaluate production capabilities, and possible acquisition approaches for first article testing, production quantities and technical data sufficient for possible competition. <BR>  <BR>6.	The parties understand that more than one source may be acting as a Program Participant, developing a solution to the same or similar parts obsolescence problem(s).  Further, in the interests of full disclosure, the Army will disclose to Program Participants (or prospective Program Participants) the existence of any MOU that has been executed with another party directed toward the same parts obsolescence problem(s). In order to participate in this program, participants must consent to disclosure of its participation to other program participants. The Army will not disclose proprietary information provided by the Program Participant in connection with their efforts.<BR><BR>Parts Obsolescence Problem(s) To Be Addressed by the Program Participant<BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR><BR>SIGNED: <BR><BR>_____________________                                              _____________________  <BR>For Team C4ISR                                                             For Program Participant<BR><BR>Dated:                                                                              Dated:<BR><BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>6.

<CONTACT>Joseph D Sherwood, Phone 813-828-0280, Fax 813-828-5111, Email joseph.sherwood@macdill.af.mil
<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is notice of intent to award sole source. The required item for this posting is AVID Symphony software (Part# 0541-03354-01) and hardware maintenance (Part# 0441-03369-01) that the government intends to award sole source under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Note - No award will be issued from responses to this notice. Response to this notice does not legally bind the government in any manner. Your concerns will be considered if you respond to this posting with a similar product/service.</p>
<p>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires renewal of AVID Symphony software and hardware maintenance. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to AVID TECHNOLOGY, 1101 PENN AVE NW STE 600, Washington, DC 20004-2514. Interested parties may e-mail joseph.sherwood@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, SSgt Joseph Sherwood, not later than Wednesday 23 July 2008; 10:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies. The reference of a 45-day response period is hereby changed to the match the response period for this notice.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>AVID Technology is the current manufacturer of the digital video editing equipment utilized by USSOCOM. USSOCOM requires this equipment to fulfill video editing requirements in support of the USSOCOM mission. Without this software there would be a major decrease in mission capability. Use of this software is instrumental in ensuring accuracy to critical Command and Control resources. USSOCOM believes award for another product would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The additional costs include duplication of effort, testing and operational readiness, certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity with the current network architecture, and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology. AVID Technology provided the following statement in writing to 6 CONS, "To best serve the particular needs of AVID's government customers, AVID's commercial resellers, which are generally unfamiliar with operative and administrative requirements of the federal procurement process, are contractually prohibited from selling AVID editing products and AVID assurance to the federal government."</p>
<p>AVID Technology thus has proprietary rights and licensing rights to the required services and updates and no other vendors can provide the maintenance service and upgrades required on the AVID software.</p>

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. 

 Sole Source - The Government intends to make a non-competitive award to Philips Medical System for the movement of currently installed and active patient monitoring equipment located at Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL (NHJ). Relocation of patient monitoring equipment includes movement of the electronic rack systems with supporting UPS units, routers, switches and peripheral cabling, including new cable pulls. In addition to the equipment move, numerous additional OEM line items are required to be purchased to match existing patient monitoring system to allow for minimum impact relating to down time of the patient monitoring ability during the switch over to new equipment location. Currently all patient monitoring equipment located at NHJ is under a service contract agreement with Philips Medical Systems, having a third party vendor initiate the move would void that agreement.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC Butner), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. To provide care to inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider (MDI), such continuity of care is to avoid unnecessary legal exposure. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAICS code is 622110. To the best of our knowledge, Duke University Medical Center is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, FMC Butner will proceed with the sole source negotiated with Duke University Medical Center.

Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to the
Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), Atlanta, GA for phases 1B (6 months) and
2 (15 months) of the Heliplane program.<span>&nbsp; </span>Previous
Phase 1 Heliplane activities were completed by a team led by Groen Brothers
Aviation which included the GIT as a subcontractor under Other Transaction Agreement
No. HR0011-06-9-0002. During Phase 1, the Heliplane team developed and
completed subscale demonstrations of key enabling technologies and completed
the preliminary design of an aircraft capable of 400 mph cruise and VTOL
performance. The GIT members of the Heliplane team developed innovative
approaches to enable controlled flight of the Heliplane at 400 mph and
approaches to meet acoustic performance requirements for tip-jets.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Phase 1 Heliplane Agreement, although
written for all phases of the DARPA research program, has concluded at Phase 1A
and reorganizing of the team members is necessary prior to continuing the
program.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The proposed Heliplane Phase IB effort is a logical
follow-on (continuation) to the effort conducted by the Heliplane team under Agreement
No. HR0011-06-9-0002.<span>&nbsp; </span>During Phase 1B,
the GIT will be required to mature the design of the Heliplane to ensure that
it closes on a 400 mph VTOL aircraft that is able to meet all program objectives,
including tip-jet noise requirements. During Phase 2, the GIT will be required
to complete an experimental demonstration of the capability to control the
Heliplane at cruise speeds up to 400 mph and to demonstrate the capability to
meet tip-jet noise goals.<span>&nbsp; </span>DARPA
anticipates Groen Brothers Aviation maintaining a role in Phases 1B and 2 of
the Heliplane program as a subcontractor to the GIT.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This publication serves as notice of intent to procure
services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp;
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute
(TSMRI), located in Juneau, AK, on a sole source basis with Dan Folley owner
and operator of ORV STELLER. The government intends to acquire services using
FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Auke Bay Laboratories (ABL) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center
(AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS will use<span>&nbsp; </span>chartered vessel STELLER to continue annual
monitoring of oceanographic conditions and abundance of juvenile salmon and
ecologically-related species in strait and inshore habitats of southeastern
Alaska from 25 July to 01 August, 2008. This is the twelve year of sampling
conducted by the Southeast Coastal Monitoring (SECM) project in the region.
Operations will involve sampling 9 of the historical SECM core stations in the
northern region. This is seven and a half day cruise that will originate and
terminate at the NMFS Subport in Juneau. The principal scientific objectives
are to collect biological and oceanographic samples with a CTD profiler,
plankton nets, and a Nordic surface rope trawl in the marine waters of the
northern region of southeastern Alaska. Collect oceanographic data at 9
stations associated with seasonal trawling: 1) CTD cast; 2) Standard plankton
hauls [NORPAC 20-m vertical, deep double oblique bongo,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and deep WP-2 (only at ABM)], to be
preserved; 3) Surface water samples (nutrients and chlorophyll), to be frozen;
and 4) Conduct comparative trawling (up to 28 hauls) with<em> Medeia</em> in northern region. Due to the importance on maintaining
the continuity of an existing 11 year oceanographic and biological time series,
an immediate vessel capable of executing this research is needed. The vessel
needs to be equipped for surface trawling for juvenile salmon with a NORDIC 264
rope trawl (20 X 24 m opening) and to conduct oceanographic research with
various plankton nets and temperature/salinity profilers. The STELLER, operated
by Mr. Dan Foley, has previously been chartered by the Auke Bay Laboratories in
April and June of this year. The vessel platform has previously proven its
capabilities to use the required trawl and oceanographic sampling gear. The
government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with a period of
performance that will commence from date of award and will end Sept 30, 2008.&nbsp; See Numbered Note 1, 100% set-aside to small business concerns. All
interested concerns must submit documentation demonstrating qualifications to
provide services as described above within 15 days of the publication date of
this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This
notice may represent the only official notice. <span>&nbsp;</span>This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated
value of less than $100,000.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>****The
Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing
business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor
Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.<span>&nbsp; </span>After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) has developed a new aqueous foam concentrate for use in mitigating blast overpressures from explosive devices. A patent application on this technology has been filed with the USPTO. The foam concentrate is intended to be introduced into a water stream at a concentration between 1.5-2%.  This new aqueous blast mitigation foam concentrate has a proportionately smaller mass and volume than current 6% aqueous blast mitigation foam concentrate formulations, and is therefore significantly more portable.  Consequently, the new aqueous blast mitigation foam concentrate is thicker and more viscous than 6% concentrate formulations but can still be educted using conventional foam generation equipment.  

Sandia is seeking partners to license this technology for use by emergency responders and/or military applications.  The new 2% concentrate uses commercial-grade chemical ingredients and is expected to be cost competitive with the current 6% concentrates.  The concentrate can also be blended using conventional equipment.

Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation. Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER FOR PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS AT THIS TIME. THE DRAFT PLANS (30%) are AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW ON OUR WEBSITE (see instructions below). The Government may consider comments and inquiries while preparing the final plans and specs; however, the Government is not seeking comments and may not provide responses to inquiries. A solicitation will be issued on or about the 21 January 2009 with proposals due on or about 21 March 2009.<BR>The purpose of the L-31 North (L-30) Seepage Management Pilot Project (SMPP) is to identify, test, and determine the relative effectiveness of seepage management technologies in order to recommend features to control groundwater flow and levee seepage from Everglades National Park.  Additionally, the project will help determine the constructability of a seepage management barrier to various depths/lengths within the semi-confining unit of the aquifer and may also yield results beneficial to the implementation of the full-scale Everglades National Park Seepage Management Project.  The proposed project is located in Miami-Dade County, north of Tamiami Trail (U.S. Highway 41) and Krome Ave (Route 997).  The L-30 borrow canal and levee mainly runs north-south but makes roughly a 45-degree southwesterly departure from Krome Avenue until it intersects Tamiami Trail, thereby forming what is commonly known as the L-30 triangle.  This 1.25 mile segment of the L-30 Canal, between S-335 and S-334, has been found to be an extremely thick portion of the Biscayne Aquifer with very high measured transmissivity.  A field drawdown test performed as a part of the L-31N SMPP and a Preliminary Seepage Report based on historical data for the area both found the triangle to have the highest seepage rate per mile between S-335 and S-334.   Conceptual Design - The tentatively selected alternative will include the design, installation, and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with collection pipes and seepage recovery wells located within the barrier, adjacent to a sheet pile window in the L-30 levee located north of US Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) between water control structures S-335 and S-336.  The barrier will have dimensions of approximately 80100 feet in depth and approximately 1,0002,200 feet in length.  The selected alternative proposes the placement of a barrier feature using a soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) mix and sheetpile construction technique.  The seepage barriers exact length and depth will be determined using detailed field data, engineering expertise from technical team members, and the A-E contractor. It is anticipated that installation of the seepage barrier through the geologic layers in the project area will be hard limestone may prove difficult, and will most likely require creative engineering techniques for excavating.  This design proposes a SCB slurry wall with a 6 ft. wide  trench.  A 100-ft long shallow sheet pile wall section is proposed as a gap in the slurry wall that will act as a shallow window to direct any desired seepage flow.  During periods of high water flow in the aquifer, seepage flows passing through the window will be captured by the system of wells and pumps.  Wells and pumps will be installed to capture the desired quantity of flow and pump it into the Water Conservation Area 3B as surface water or into adjacent canals.  The pumping system design will allow for the pumps to be controlled locally as well as from a remote location using telemetry.  Flow measurement devices will be installed at the ends and at the mid-point of the barrier.  An approximate 10-ft by 10-ft control building will be required to house electrical controls and panels at the mid-point of the barrier.  It is anticipated that the sheet pile depth can also be adjusted to create varying window size as needed.  Preliminary design concept places the sheet pile at a depth of approximately 50 ft.  General Construction - The following engineering features are conceptual in nature and may or may not represent the final design of this project.  Soil-Cement Bentonite Slurry Wall - The Soil-Cement-Bentonite (SCB) slurry wall will be placed in a 3-ft wide trench cut out of a 6 ft. wide pre-blasted zone.  By possibly  pre-blasting this zone the properties of the porous limestone will change to a zone containing less permeable materials.  The trench is to be excavated through the pre-blasted zone of limestone down to a pre-established invert elevation with a base in the less permeable Tamiami Sands.  Typically soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) walls are 24 to 30 inches wide and match the width of the equipment.  In this case the blasted zone is anticipated to be approximately six (6) feet wide which allows for ~30 inch trench centered within the blasted lower permeability zone leaving lower permeability material on both sides of the trench.  It is reasoned that the engineered filter will enable the wall to be constructed using conventional excavating equipment (e.g., extended stick backhoe or similar) is probable, while minimizing loss of the bentonite slurry mixture.  After the six feet wide trench has been blasted, the 30-inch trench will be excavated.  As the excavation proceeds, bentonite-water slurry is continuously added to build a filter pack and ensure that the trench remains open.  After the blasted material has been excavated, it is replaced with a backfilled mixture of soil-cement-bentonite.  The preliminary mix design assumes 10 to 15% cement and 2 to 5% bentonite mixed with the excavated rock materials.  Sheet Pile Wall - A sheet pile wall will be constructed at the midsection of the slurry wall. This 100 ft long shallow sheet pile wall will be inserted to bridge the gap between the 2 sections of slurry wall to act as a shallow window directing or funneling any seepage flow.   The pumps could be possibly used to divert excess seepage.  The sheet pile depth of emplacement and size may be varied or later changed to create a window of varying size depending on need.  The method of installation may require a creative exaction technique (ex. Blasting through limestone layers), followed by pile driving to a pre-established invert elevation by hammer or vibratory methods.  There is likely to be some disturbance surrounding the piles so there is possible need for seepage tightening of the wall by grouting or other sealing methods.  This seepage tightening will seal any holes or gaps in between individual piles that remain after installation would be plugged. Disposal - All unsuitable material will be disposed of within the L-31N right-of-way. Cleared, grubbed and excavated materials that are suitable for reuse may be stockpiled on site for grading and erosion control of the embankment.  Staging - It is anticipated that the A-E contractor will need approximately 1 acre for staging construction trailers and 3-4 acres for the staging heavy construction equipment.  Access to the project site could be from State Rd 997 (Krome Ave.) and/or from U.S. Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-334 or S-356. As a first option, the team would like to the contractor to use the area is within the L-31N right-of way located along L-31N (south bank), beginning 0.5 mile south of the north gate at U.S. Highway 41, then southward about 0.25 mile.  The second option, the staging are would be located on the L-29 (north bank & levee), between S-334 and the south entrance of the L 30 levee.  Testing - After construction is completed, testing of the barrier system will be performed within a period of two years (two wet and two dry seasons) to determine the relative effectiveness of the seepage barrier.  The proposed work is located in Miami-Dade County, North of Tamiami Trail (US Highway 41) and Krome Avenue (Route 997).    The Magnitude of Construction is between $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Proposals will be evaluated on technical, past performance and price.

Point of Contact for this requirement is Nancy Hilleary at Nancy.L.Hilleary@usace.army.mil, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315.<BR><BR>Statement of Scope of Work (SOW) for Professional Services to Support Development of Computerized Methods & Procedures for NNOMPEAS System Operation<BR><BR><BR>I.  Introduction<BR><BR>The Institute for Water Resources of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE-CEIWR) <BR>has been tasked by corps headquarters (HQUSACE) to develop a centralized computer-based system to tabulate waterborne transportation cost structures for coastal deep-draft waterway projects.  Waterborne transportation costs structures and the differentials therein as derived from or associated with waterway project or plan alternatives serve as the primary basis for estimation of economic benefit(s) of waterway improvement and maintenance projects.  The emphasis of output for system development will be the estimation of waterborne transportation costs for deep-draft carriers conveying foreign (i.e., imports and exports) and\or domestic trade and serving coastal deep-draft harbors of the United States for which the Corps Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) compiles waterway traffic data.  Also required will be the capability to compile and tabulate waterway operation & maintenance (O&M) data within the framework of requirements for life-cycle cost evaluation with comparability to general program management objectives of the Corps.  In addition, while the emphasis of system development will be for evaluation of O&M of deep-draft waterways, the logic and procedures for life-cycle project economic benefit and cost evaluation(s) are to be comparable with established guidance for logic, practices and procedures applied to evaluation of both ongoing O&M as well as new work for pending or newly constructed general navigation features (GNFs) and marginal or incremental improvement measures to existing waterway system projects.   <BR><BR>In reiteration, the system will need to tabulate two kinds or realms of costs and then have the capability to compare them as a measure for return on investment (ROI) for fiscal\budgetary evaluation of alternatives with regard to needs for ongoing O&M maintenance work and dredging.  The costs are:<BR><BR>- Waterborne Transportation Costs (from which economic benefits are estimated)<BR>- Waterway Project Operation & Maintenance Costs (O&M) <BR><BR>Comparison of the two realms of costs can provide for reasonable evaluation of return on investment (ROI) subject to requirements of comparability in price levels and basis or context of estimation.<BR><BR>II.  Description of Technical Work and Requirements<BR><BR>Waterborne transportation costs of concern for the scope of work or services (SOW) herein entail costs associated with vessel operations to support delivery of cargo or commodities coastwise along the nations coasts or to and from foreign trade partners and the United States via the nations deep-draft coastal waterway system.  Related cost structures may change, differ or be impacted according to vessel size and capacity and potential limitations on capacity utilization imposed by waterway conditions (such as restrictions on immersed hull draft due to specifications for waterway system depths).  Other potential limitations on vessel utilization include limited vessel breadth and\or length due to channel width, turning basin diameter, and other waterway physical specifications or criteria. The primary criteria for system development described under the SOW herein shall be changes in reference and controlling waterway depth (and corresponding liberties or restrictions on vessel size, transit draft and respective cargo capacity utilization, and corresponding cargo transportation costs).  <BR><BR>Development will be undertaken in phases to support progressive and rational development as deemed best suited to requirements for reasonable accuracy and technical validity of estimates as estimates from a fully developed and finalized system may be applied or contribute to evaluation of budgetary programs for waterway system maintenance.  Generally, the contractual SOW herein is to support the prototype or first phase of computerized system development that will involve analysis of two designated coastal deep-draft harbors as a test bed or test case but that can be readily applied and executed for comparable evaluations of other coastal deep-draft ports or harbor waterways under Federal stewardship in the United States.  More specifically, the SOW is for professional technical labor services to support development of computerized data file structures and creation or augmentation of software or systems programming and related products needed to develop and manipulate databases, control and handle critical data, estimate or synthesize and populate missing data, execute computational algorithms for derived relationships from input data, and (to the extent and nature required) generate analytical and managerial information and reports from resulting calculated output concerning deep-draft maritime transportation trade and operations.  <BR><BR>The emphasis and priority for first phase development shall be to support the evaluation of economic benefits (i.e., waterborne transportation cost analysis) with basic framework structuring and development for evaluation of waterway O&M costs.  Accordingly, associated requirements will include development and evaluation of computerized analytical algorithms and subroutines for waterborne transportation cost analysis.  The operational and mathematical logic and formulation of algorithms respective to both vessel and port operations relative to national economic development (NED) criteria as (mandated for application by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)) will be developed primarily by the staff of USACE-IWR.  The contractor in turn will be responsible for translation of provided logic and algorithms into functional computerized source or programming code and that will correctly execute associated logic and numerical\analytical technique and produce output and information conforming to reporting requirements to be specified for the system.  The contractor will also be responsible for any affiliated or ancillary technical labor, supplies, and supply services appropriate for described work and responsibilities considered a reasonable expectation for professional work comparable in nature. <BR><BR>Correspondingly, the work will first require integration and manipulation or processing of several separate databases that will be acquired from both the private sector and developed or compiled from within the Federal Government (with the latter source being most notably the Army Corps of Engineers).  Databases assembled by the Government and to be provided to the contractor will include (but are not necessarily limited to) information for vessel name and IMO number, date (and time, where available) of vessel movement, direction of vessel movement, tonnage laden or discharged, and prior port of call.  Additional databases to be secured by the Government from private\commercial sector sources and provided to the contractor will include ship registry information (such as from the Lloyds Register of Ships) that will allow cross-matching of vessel physical characteristics (i.e., type of vessel, length, breadth, summer loadline draft, cargo capacities etc.) computerized tables for itinerary listings and voyage distances.  The primary mechanism for merging or combining databases will be the  vessel IMO number which will provide for critical common identifier across all or most of the databases or sources that will be employed.<BR><BR>Databases or requisite database access will be provided to the contractor by USACE-IWR.  Generally, the databases involved will include (but not necessarily be limited to) the following information:<BR><BR>Water Commerce Statistical Center Data Files (USACE-WCSC\IWR)<BR>-	Transits and calls<BR>-	Tonnage loaded and\or discharged<BR>-	Selected vessel characteristics concerning identification and transit at a given harbor (vessel transit draft, IMO number, etc.)<BR>-	Vessel operating costs per unit of time<BR>-	Vessel load factor parameters<BR><BR>Other Government (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] & USACE]<BR>-	Tides and tidal datum information (benchmarks; elevations, probabilities for elevation, duration and frequency, etc.)<BR><BR>External\Commercial Data Sources<BR>-	Vessel characteristics & itinerary information (LRFairplay Lloyds Register & Sea Web)<BR>-	Computerized nautical distance tables (Veson Nautical)<BR><BR><BR>Via integration of these databases, data and information concerning deep-draft vessel movements with regard to vessel characteristics, general parameters for vessel management and operations, and cargo throughput will be available that will allow subsequent evaluation and analysis of transportation costs in the context and guidance for NED criteria.  As with many general transportation databases it is anticipated that initial input data will need to be reviewed, screened and reasonably corrected within an automated environment for missing and erroneous data.  The logic and algorithms for related data correction are to be developed by USACE-IWR and provided to the contractor.    Nonetheless, given a primary objective evaluating vessel voyage costs, the contractor or provider of required professional services must be thoroughly and expertly versed in the evaluation of deep-draft waterborne transportation costs within the framework of NED criteria including the ability to understand detailed information and statistics regarding or associated with:<BR><BR>-  General input data and database structures of the transportation statistics routinely handled and compiled by the Corps Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC)<BR>-  Vessel physical characteristics and parameters respective to type and deadweight class of carrier including but not necessarily limited to:<BR>- Physical dimensions and capabilities for speed and related bunkerage consumption<BR>- Analysis of volumetric and weight carrying capacity,<BR>- Variability of displacement\immersion characteristics relative to management and   analysis of critical load factors (cargo and carriage load rates and regime, allowances for stowage and cargo density, fixed and variable ballast, bunkerage management etc.)<BR>- Vessel operating cost structures relative to mode of operation (whether in-port, at-sea, etc.) <BR>-  Port and Terminal Operation; foreign and domestic, with concern for but not necessarily limited to:<BR>	- Cargo throughput capability of facilities<BR>- Supporting waterway system characteristics or specifications and how they relate to limitations of vessel operating parameters or management practices (depths, use of tide windows, terminal capacities, etc.)<BR>-  Port\terminal operating cost structures (explicit tariffs and harbor or port surcharges; implicit costs or cost allocations).<BR>-  Understanding critical inputs or factors for evaluation of potential variances in cost structures due to changes in vessel operations.<BR><BR><BR>As generally defined the process for estimation of waterborne transportations costs will involve five (5) general stages or elements:<BR><BR>I. -  Initial merge and combining of required databases containing data as available to derive the primary structure of databases and listings containing base input data regarding vessel operations and characteristics (including cargo movements) by date and location.<BR><BR>II. -  Computerized processing for review of validity\consistency of data as initially input, and execution of computerized algorithms to synthesize or populate values or parameters for missing data or input required for waterborne transportation cost calculations. <BR><BR>III. -  Calculation of waterborne transportation or vessel voyage costs (at the individual vessel movement level [with separate tabulations for inbound versus outbound or import versus export, etc.]<BR><BR>IV. -  Aggregation of waterborne transportation cost structures for individual vessels into summary level reports or templates addressing (but not necessarily limited to) vessel type and size class according to port or location, waterway segment or reach, and reference depth.  The benchmark for waterway segment depth shall be the reference depth (as constructed and ideally maintained) of the supporting waterway segment or section corresponding to each vessel movement.<BR><BR>V. -  Information as derived for stage IV with alternatives for reference depth (and corresponding adjustment(s) to waterborne transportation costs) based on assumptions for reduced or modified levels of maintenance dredging.<BR><BR>Time span for data evaluation -  Ultimately for a fully developed system (should further development be implemented) the time frame for data evaluation and aggregation would\will be three (3) to five (5) years historic and three (3) years to five (5) years into the future based on a forecast module or mechanism to be integrated into the system.  For the first phase or test bed for development however, data time span shall be limited to the three most recent and complete calendar years of waterborne commerce data as available from the WCSC-USACE (which at present, as of the development of the SOW herein, spans from 2004 through 2006).  Respective to applied databases, calculated values and desired managerial information from the system, needed features for computerized programming will entail the ability to review and evaluate data and statistics on an annual basis for each year of data addressed or input into the system as well as the ability to aggregate designated or selected years to derive arithmetic average and average annual equivalent (AAEQ) valuations.  The ability to derive aggregated annual, annual arithmetic average and AAEQ values shall apply to tabulation of both transportation cost structures, transportation cost structure constituents, and project O&M costs.  Per requirements for ability to audit and verify applied data, algorithms, and assumptions for each individual vessel movement, capabilities to drill down and review via summary voyage cost table(s) all pertinent data by individual vessel call and transit shall be developed programmed as an integral part of the system from which higher level reports and aggregated statistical tabulations shall be derived.<BR><BR>Developmental work by the contractor will require access to detailed WCSC traffic data and information.  Due to confidentiality requirements for reporting or contributing parties, the contractor shall provide a secure physical platform for storage and handling for SOW task work or execution.  This platform will be safeguarded for intrusion and unauthorized access whether by direct physical access or via any electronic means (such as through the internet).  The contractor will be provided needed data and information for development via secured means or mode of transfer (to be determined by the Government) and the contractor will provide for secure access via a secure link between the contractors developmental platform and supporting or collaborative parties or personnel within the Corps as required, most notably technical analysts employed at the USACE-WCSC and USACE-IWR.  As a requirement of the SOW herein, the contractor will prepare and submit a security plan for the safe and secure handling and transfer of data and information identified as proprietary, sensitive, or confidential and not intended for public distribution or handling and access otherwise than as approved by the designated approving official for USACE-WCSC or USACE-IWR.  This security plan will address three general areas, a.)  specifications of the development platform, b.) proposed measures for security, and c.) acceptance of responsibility maintenance of data and information security to the extent practical and reasonably within the contractors realm of authoritative control.<BR> <BR>On-site contact\coordination and associated travel -  It is envisioned that due to the detailed nature of the work as described that facilitation of work efforts will require technical analysts and representatives of both the contractor and USACE to meet together on-site (preferably at USACE-IWR [7701 Telegraph Road, Casey Building, Alexandria, VA, 22315] where discussion and review of concepts and products than cannot not be readily conducted or resolved via written correspondence or standard electronic communication can be most efficiently or interactively conducted.  Specific to the requirements for described work and objectives for product demonstration, it is requested that the contractor include in his response an estimate for reimbursable travel costs and proposed time periods for travel and meetings.<BR><BR>Technical Point of Contact (POC) -  The technical point of contact for work requirements and selected shall be:<BR><BR>Ian Mathis<BR>Institute for Water Resources  (USACE-IWR)<BR>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USCAE)<BR>7701 Telegraph Road<BR>Alexandria, Virginia  22315<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a Brand Name Only requirement and a small business set-aside.  NGA has standardized HP ProLiant servers. Maintaining the same hardware architecture minimizes total cost of ownership. All LAN components within a network need to work with all other components flawlessly. Any brand or part that is incompatible or malfunctioning will quickly degrade the entire network performance to an unacceptable level.  This complexity and fragility is the reason that NGA must continue to maintain their HP servers with certified HP Parts and Technicians.  HP parts are essential to the Government's requirement thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  Please submit HP warranty service only; resellers are sufficient but no  third party warranties.  Period of Performance will be one (1) year from date of award.  Award will be made based on lowest price technically acceptable.  See attachment for item details.

<a href="mailto:christopher.lende@us.army.mil">USPFO for Montana</a>
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. MTARNG anticipates award to one small business, subject to availability of funds. The NAICS Code is 541930 and the size standard is $6.0 million.<BR><BR>STATEMENT OF WORK<BR><BR>1.	The Montana Army National Guard (MTARNG) State Partnership Program (SPP)is conducting Military Combat Lifesaver training with members of the Kyrgyzstan Army as part of an ongoing State Partnership Mission.<BR><BR>2.	The MTARNG SPP needs all course materials, currently in English, translated into Russian Language.<BR><BR>a.	The course material consists of a manual of approximately 68,000 words of text in both Microsoft word and Adobe .pdf files, and an additional 360 PowerPoint slides contained in approximately 10 PowerPoint Presentations.  The material is for a program which teaches advanced medical techniques to non-medical personnel.  The translation will need to maintain the format (including illustrations) of the original.<BR><BR>b.	The translator(s) must ensure consistent translation of terms which have multiple possibilities for translation - or in other words, the document must be a coherent whole in which technical terms remain consistent throughout.<BR><BR>c.	The materials to be translated are property of the US Government and the translated copies will remain the property of the US Government.<BR><BR>d.	Translation is to be completed and delivered in electronic form NLT 06 September 2008.<BR><BR>e.	In order to aid evaluation of bids submitted, contractors will also be required to translate page 4-6 (see below) of the text in order to evaluate translation ability.<BR><BR>3.	Contractor will be supplied electronic copies of material to be translated upon contract award.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR>Page 4-6, text:<BR><BR><BR>(b) Wrap the other tail around the casualty in the opposite direction and<BR>bring it back over the dressing.<BR><BR>(c) Tighten the tails and tie them with a nonslip knot over the center of<BR>the dressing. The knot will provide additional pressure over the wound and will help to<BR>keep the seal airtight. The bandages should not be tight enough to interfere with<BR>breathing.<BR>CAUTION: If an object is protruding from the wound, tie the knot beside the object,<BR>not on it.<BR><BR>4-6. POSITIONING A CASUALTY WITH A DRESSED OPEN CHEST WOUND<BR><BR>Position the casualty on his side (recovery position) with his injured side next to<BR>the ground (figure 4-4). Pressure from contact with the ground acts like a splint to the<BR>injured side and helps to reduce the pain. (Positioning the casualty on his uninjured<BR>side might cause difficulty in breathing.)<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Figure 4-4. Casualty with a dressed open chest wound.<BR><BR>NOTE: The casualty may wish to sit up. If he can breathe easier when sitting up than<BR>lying on his side, allow him to sit up with his back leaning against a tree, wall,<BR>or other support. If he becomes tired, have him lie on his injured side again.<BR><BR>Section II. TREATING TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX<BR><BR>4-7. TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX<BR><BR>Tension pneumothorax occurs when there is a buildup of air in the plural space<BR>and the air cannot escape. As the air outside the lung continues to increase, the<BR>affected lung continues to collapse. In addition to causing further collapse of affected<BR>lung, the increasing pressure of the trapped air pushes on the mediastinum (the mass of<BR>material separating the two plural sacs). This movement of the mediastinum may<BR>compress the uninjured lung, major blood vessels, and the heart. You will need to<BR>perform a needle chest decompression to relieve the pressure of the tension<BR>pneumothorax.<BR><BR><BR>IS0871 					4-6<BR>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Other factors considered will be the vendors submitted translation of page 4-6. Offerors shall ensure that the above factors are listed in their proposals. If translation from Offerors meets our requirements set for in the statement of work, price will be the determining factor.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:  NHLBI-PB(HL)-2008-199/MKL

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format specified in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(HL)-2008-199/MKL and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small businesses.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to procure the items specified below from Roper Scientific, Inc., Doing Business As (DBA) Photometrics, 3440 East Britannia Drive, Suite 100, Tucson, Arizona  85706-5006.

1)  QUANTEM: 512SC
MAG Biosystems EMCCD camera and MAG Biosystems Advanced Capture software option for MAG Biosystems Laser-based Live-Cell Confocal Imaging System.  This product includes control software for Confocal, automated Olympus microscope, Filter Wheel and other Illumination devices, plus all MAG Biosystems camera and device drivers, including MAG Biosystems Laser Launch Unit.  Includes high-speed EMCCD camera option for Confocal, 1394 interface card, power supply and cables, and a USA power supply unit. 

2)  MAG Confocal System:  MAG Biosystems Laser-based Live-cell Confocal Imaging System for inverted Olympus microscope.  Product Description:  Pinhole array confocal system with illumination light-gathering microlens system.  High-speed live-cell confocal imager, includes motorized filter and beamsplitter, fiber optic coupling, laser beam shaping optics. Includes camera mounting hardware for Sony 285 CCD camera.  Computer-interface digital controller also included for adjustable disk speed.  USA power supply, power and control cables included.

3)  Semrock Dichroic, Quantity of one (1).
Semrock triple pass dichroic for DAPI, FITC, and TRITC.

4)  Chroma Emission Filter, Quantity of one (1).                                                        DAPI/FITC/TRITC.

5)  Adapter for EMCCD Camera, Quantity of one (1).
EMCCD camera mounting adapter for MAG Biosystems Laser-based Confocal Imaging System.  This adapter is required for mounting all 8mm x 8mm CCD camera systems to MAG Biosystems confocals. 

The MAG Biosystem and the MAG EMCCD camera are two critical devices that the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) require in order to upgrade their existing Olympus microscope for high resolution imaging.  This Olympus microscope will be the central instrument in a project to examine the cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur upon the interaction of lymphocytes with target cells.  To achieve this goal, the LCB has recently modified the microscope by adding a custom-made optical trap to manipulate target cell position.  In its current form; however, the microscope lacks the necessary sensitivity and resolution for imaging single live lymphocytes during their interaction with target cells.  The MAG Biosystem provides a spinning disc confocal imaging capability that consists of Yokogawa CSU-X1 head and filter sets.  This system generates bright images with minimum photobleaching.  The MAG EMCCD camera (QUANTEM: 512SC base) provides superior sensitivity relative to similar cameras in the current market.  The coupling of these two devices will enable the LCB to visualize the dynamics of small and relatively dim objects such as centrosomes and microtubules in live lymphocytes.  Therefore, the addition of this MAG spinning disc imaging system to the existing optical trap microscope is absolutely essential to the studies being performed in the LCB.  

The MAG Biosystems has the spinning disk with patented micro-lens technology for increased light throughput.  The disk speed, filter position, and emission filters are custom configured for the LCB’s existing microscope and are all controllable via software that is currently owned by the Lab.  The MAG EMCCD camera is 1394 controllable for high-speed data transfer.  This feature also eliminates the need for a control board.  The other unique features of this camera are that it is gain-stabilized and has an internal calibration routine to compensate for EMCCD decay over time.  All of these features add up to the high quality of performance required for the high resolution imaging in the LCB’s research studies.
 
The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions:  1) FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  ISSUED BY:  USACE, Humphreys Engineering Center Support Activity, ATTN:  CECT-HC, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315-3660.  The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.  The NAICS Code is 541511.  The following FAR provisions apply:  52.212-1,  52.212-2, 52.212-3 52.212-4, and 52.212-5.<BR><BR>Request for Proposals:  Development of an Electronic Permitting (E-Permit) System for the US Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Regulatory Program<BR><BR><BR>Background:  The mission of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Regulatory Program is to protect the Nations aquatic resources, while allowing reasonable development through fair, flexible and balanced permit decisions. The Corps evaluates permit applications for essentially all construction activities that occur in the Nations waters, including wetlands.  Extensive documentation on the USACE Regulatory program may be found at: http://www.usace.army.mil/cw/cecwo/reg/<BR><BR>The electronic permitting system to be developed under this contract will allow applicants to apply for permits online over the internet.  The current application for a regulatory permit is Engineering Form  4345.  http://www.usace.army.mil/cw/cecwo/reg/eng4345a.pdf.  It is expected that the current form will be revised during the request for proposal process to reflect changing in federal regulation. The e-permit system should allow both the electronic submission of permits and for the completion and off-line submission of permit requests   The E-Permit system must allow for the establishment of user accounts so an applicant or agent/consultant can manage and track multiple pending or completed applications. The system must allow for the uploading of associated documents to be associated with the permit. The E-Permit system should support checking the status of permit application regardless of whether it was submitted online or mailed it to the Corps.   <BR><BR>A number of states have ongoing E-Permit programs and joint application programs with USACE.  The E-Permit system will be required to support interaction with multiple states, and specialized data element requirements for various states.  A standard XML schema for E-Permits will be developed, reviewed and published as part of this contract.    The E-Permit system must interface with an Oracle database on an internal USACE network.  The E-Permit system system will reside outside the USACE protected network, and may be either hosted on publicly accessible servers at USACE, or at an off-site hosting facility provided as government furnished equipment.   A data transfer mechanism that allows data to be pushed from the internal network and pulled to the internal network via XML or other specification will be established as part of this contract. <BR><BR><BR>Technical Requirements<BR><BR>This E-Permit application will be required to support interoperability with other information systems. Interoperability must be based on DoD approved open standards in the DISR.  The proposed solution must support the USACE standard internet browser which is Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 with SP1 and must support other commonly used browsers such as Firefox.<BR>The E-Permit application must operate using secure http protocol (https), and must always have a valid DoD issued certificate. The proposed solution should not require software plug-ins other than those commonly found on desktop computers such as Adobe PDF and Flash.  <BR><BR>The contractor must establish separate development and testing environments.  The testing environment must be available to government and other team members during normal business hours.  The contractor must make use of a government provided code sub-version (SVN) code repository.  The contractor must make use of a government provided issue tracking system.  <BR>Applications developed should be ADA Section 508 compliant.  Applications developed must comply with Army Regulation AR-25-1 for Knowledge Management and Information Management.  Information contained within this system subject to protection under Privacy Act.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals number HSCG44-08-R-TED392.This number is for tracking purposes only.  Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334111.  The SBA size standard in employees is 1,000. The Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), USCG intends to purchase on a non-competitive basis with TRANSAS USA INC. of Bothell WA. for the purchase of 94 each Transas Software Upgrade Licences. The USCG currently owns 94 system licenses for Transas NaviSailor 3000 ECDIS-I, MNS21. This software upgrade is required to provide software installation disk & license to update the software to Transas NaviSailor 3100 ECDIS, MNS 27. The proposed contract action resulting from this synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons/parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis/solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, and for informational purposes of future procurements. The contractor for this proposed Sole Source contract is: TRANSAS USA INC. Cage Code 1K9D6. This is a Sole Source Procurement. 

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
 It is necessary for the performance of Coast Guard Cutters missions to navigate safely in  oceans/waterways/coastlines/ports.
The existing Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) on the 87’ Coastal Patrol Boat Fleet runs Transas NaviSailor 3000 ECDIS-I software.  A Transas software upgrade meets the new requirements at minimum cost without making significant alterations to the system configuration.  It is cost prohibitive and more time consuming to change the ECDIS system software to another manufacturer to meet a few new requirements; because, we would have to completely redesign the system, including software, hardware (ECDIS software certification is completed in tandem with specific hardware), sensor interfaces, support documentation, and training.  By upgrading existing software with the same manufacturer, we will not have to replace the existing hardware, reintegrate sensor interfaces, make drastic changes to support documentation, or provide new training.
As part of the original NaviSailor 3000 ECDIS-I purchase, Transas USA agreed to issue the same license number to all unit licenses as an explicit accommodation to the USCG.  It is normal practice to issue a separate license number for each unit.  This use of license numbers should be maintained to support USCG support of the 87’ CPB fleet.  Transas USA should be treated as the sole source vendor because their dealer network is not able to accommodate an upgrade from NS3000 to NS3100, nor are they equipped to issue several unit licenses under the same number.  
To develop and duplicate this effort would cost the Government an estimated amount of: $2.26 Million Dollars. The estimated cost for hardware and software (this does not include documentation development) is $24,000 per unit (in 2004 dollars) and is based on the initial purchase price of the hardware and software installation when the 87’ CPBs were delivered.  For 94 units, the total cost would be $2.26 Million.  
The estimated cost for the software upgrade alone is $1000, for a total coast of $94,000.
End of Sole Source Justification.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 30 JULY, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about AUGUST 1, 2008. Contact CYNTHIA.D.SOULES,Cynthia.d.soules@uscg.mil or 252-335-6438 for questions regarding this solicitation.

The length of the contract shall not exceed 60 months. The exercise of any option period is subject to the availability of funds at the time of the exercise of the option.

<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The contractor shall provide non-personal services in accordance with FAR Subpart 37.4 - Nonpersonal Health Care Services.

The contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance as specified in the solicitation/contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Security Requirements for Contractor Personnel:</strong> All Contractor personnel utilized under this contract shall submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any PSA/CSOSA facility. The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Background Investigations:</strong> The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work under the contract until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the PSA/CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor. Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a PSA/CSOSA facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below. The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Office of Procurement. The following forms will be provided and must be completed: </span></p>

To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. PSA/CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation. If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with PSA/CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">PSA reserves the right to determine suitability of any contractor or contractor employee to work on this contract prior to the employee gaining access to any PSA facility or system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Contractor's Responsibility:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract.

The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual's presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">All potential offerors are advised that this solicitation includes the clause FAR 52.212-4 (Oct 2003) for Commercial Items, which at paragraph (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR), requires all contractors doing business with the Federal Government after September 30, 2003, to be registered in the CCR database.

<DESC>This announcement is the second amendment to this combined synopsis/solicitation, 601818Q634.  The purpose of this amendment is to correct an email address, correct line item 8's description, publish question and answers that have been received, and extend the closing date of the solicitation.  The following sections in the previous announcment are replaced with the listed below:
(v) Replace L/I 8 with the below: 
8	Channel Iron 4" X 5.4 # - Length 12' minimum	                  1100	ft
(xi) Offers are due no later than 04 August 2008 at 16:00 pm MST. 
(xii) For other information please contact: Mr. Eric Jordan, Contract Specialist: Phone: 303-236-4329 Fax: 303-236-4791Email: eric_w_jordan@fws.gov 
The following are answers to the questions received:
1. Mill seconds.  Is this correct?   Yes this is correct.
2. Line Items 5,6,&7.  Mill products are produced in 20 foot sections (r/l)not 12 feet.  Will you accept?  The minimums are the length we will cut the stock to so that we can use it.  Twice the minimum length would be optimal to minimize waste.
3.  Line Item 8 calls for 12" minimum length.  Is this correct?  No, it should read 12 feet.
4.  Is material galvanized or coated vinyl?  This is just structural steel.  None of it needs to be galvanized or vinyl coated.
5.  Is the pipe to be domestic or import?  Domestic is preferred just because of our unknown of the quality of imported steel.  See the next Q&A for more info.
6.  The requirement is for 2nd mill steel.  Can 1st run import steel be substituted?  If it meets the minimum requirements of 2nd mill domestic steel.  However, any product has to be in accordance with the Buy American Act .
7.  Is the pipe ERW, continuos weld?  We can not answer this question.  The pipe just needs to meet all of the criteria we have specified.
8.  Standard pipe is 21' lengths, will your staff have a way to cut the pipe to length?  Yes we do.  We need 12' lengths so our intention was to buy 24' lengths and be able to cut them in half and use both pieces and have minimal waste and maximize our dollar.  See questions #2 also.
9.  Is the pipe plain end or threaded and coupled?  Plain pipe is fine.  Threaded is not needed.
10.  Can oilfield pipe be used instead of schedule 40 pipe?  No due to it cannot be used for the fence area and the breakout of the different areas are not specified in the requirement.
11.  Can pipe be substituted for 4" tube?  No.  For this item, the square tubing is needed.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to answer technical questions:

Question:  Regarding Specifications 3. Extractor voltage and 4. Supresor voltage: No current value is stated. Can you tell us how much current shall be delivered by these sources?

Answer: Extractor current at least 200 µA; Suppressor current at least 10 µA.
 

Question: Regarding Specification 5. Control: Which kind of interface do you prefer?  IEEE488, Ethernet or USB interface.

Answer:  All three are acceptable.

 
Question: How do you think, the outputs shall be constructed. Do you wish a multiple connector and if yes, have you any proposal for such a connector, or can we do single HV- connectors for each output separately? So we would have four 20kV output connectors (2 for the current supply (heater), one for the extractor and one for the supressor). Do you need an extra output connector for the beam voltage or is it enough to have the two symmetrical heater outputs laying on beam voltage potential?

Answer:  We will eventually build a custom adapter to our cable, so connector is not critical. Single HV-connectors for each output will work. No extra beam voltage connector is required; the two heater outputs are sufficient.

All other items remain unchanged.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to answer questions posed by potential quoters.
Question 1:  
a.	What type of Aramid fiber is being called out specifically (Nomex, Kevlar, Twaron, etc.)?  Also note that there are several different types of each of these fibers (assuming Kevlar:  K29, K49, K100, etc.).  
Answer:  We are looking for a ballistic grade polyaramid.  Based on my knowledge of the marketplace, either Kevlar or Twaron would be acceptable, but Nomex would not be acceptable because it doesn’t have the ballistic resistant properties commonly used in body armor.
b.	Also note that there are several different types of weaves and weights for these fibers (assuming K29: Satin Weave, Basket Weave, 24 oz, etc.).
Answer:  We have previously done work with plain weave Kevlar 129, but it is not our intention to limit this procurement to one particular fiber or weave.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
Question 2:  When speaking of laminated fibers, are they laminated together for a thicker, more rigid laminate, or are they left separated for flexibility?
Answer:  We have previously done work with both 2 and 4 ply laminates, but it is not our intent to limit this procurement to one particular fabric.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date, remain unchanged.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to answer questions posed by potential quoters.
Question 1:  
a.	What type of Aramid fiber is being called out specifically (Nomex, Kevlar, Twaron, etc.)?  Also note that there are several different types of each of these fibers (assuming Kevlar:  K29, K49, K100, etc.).  
Answer:  We are looking for a ballistic grade polyaramid.  Based on my knowledge of the marketplace, either Kevlar or Twaron would be acceptable, but Nomex would not be acceptable because it doesn’t have the ballistic resistant properties commonly used in body armor.
b.	Also note that there are several different types of weaves and weights for these fibers (assuming K29: Satin Weave, Basket Weave, 24 oz, etc.).
Answer:  We have previously done work with plain weave Kevlar 129, but it is not our intention to limit this procurement to one particular fiber or weave.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
Question 2:  When speaking of laminated fibers, are they laminated together for a thicker, more rigid laminate, or are they left separated for flexibility?
Answer:  We have previously done work with both 2 and 4 ply laminates, but it is not our intent to limit this procurement to one particular fabric.  We would like to make this procurement as open and competitive as possible.  It is our objective to obtain armor samples which are representative of what is typically used in the marketplace, but not to use certified models of body armor for research purposes to avoid the appearance of testing commercial products.  A vendor may suggest something which is most commonly used in commercial body armor.
All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date, remain unchanged.

</p>

<p>Question 1: What type of PBX is in use (manufacturer and system model/version)?</p>
<p>Answer 1: There is no PBX for USUHS phone lines. They are 5ESS Verizon Centrex Lines. The switch is owned and maintained by Verizon.</p>
<p>Question 2: In your request, the initial installation is to support 2500 users; however, you also request pricing to provide VM for an additional 7500 users. The hardware specification for the server supporting the initial 2500 users will not meet the manufacturers specifications for a system of the size to support 10,000 subscribers. Shall all respondents supply pricing for a server which will also allow you to grow to 10,000 subscribers?<br />Answer 2: The requirement for 7500 additional users can be eliminated. We will probably never need that many boxes. 2500 will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Question 3: Can you please elaborate on the following request: 14) Voice to Email and Email Notification. The line item requested in the pricing section does not ask for any of the following items which could address item 14 above: Unified Messaging, Email Text to Speech, and Speech Recognition.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Voice to E-mail is an option that would allow a message to be recorded and then delivered over email. This is a very useful feature, because it allows users to listen to their message from their computers and then archive them appropriately. It allows them to read their messages from wherever there is an email terminal with Windows software. This is a good option to have but it is not a critical item and it can be eliminated. Unified Messaging, Email Text to Speech, and Speech Recognition are not features that we require.</p>

<p>Question 4: Regarding the presentation format such as number of hard copies, electronic, or CD's. How would you like this information delivered?</p>
<p>Answer 4: One (1) hard copy delivered either by fax (301-295-1716), mail (4301 Jones Bridge Road, A1040C; Attn: Nadine Utz, Bethesda, MD 20814), or email (nadineutz@usuhs.mil). Please be sure to follow the pricing structure listed in the RFQ.</p>
<p>Question 5: In the Minimum Specifications Item # 13c (. 2,500 Voicemail Boxes expandable to 3,000 Voicemail Boxes). Should we provide the option to expand from 2,500 Voicemail Boxes to 3,000 Voicemail Boxes?</p>
<p>Answer 5: No. 2,500 should be sufficient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Question 6: Is the system you are looking for to be connected with the hospital's PBX and current phone system, or are you looking for stand alone voice-mail boxes? In other words: Are you looking for a voice-mail answering system that will pick-up when the specific party being contacted is not available and then have the option of leaving a message, or a voicemail system where one calls a specific party's voicemail box for the purpose of leaving them a message?</p>
<p>Answer 6: We are not on the hospital's PBX. We are on the Verizon 5ESS Centrex Switch and we are looking for a stand alone answering system that will pick-up when the specific party being contacted is not available or the calling party's line is busy and then have the option of leaving a message.</p>

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG23-08-R-MMN450 is hereby amended to respond to the following Vendor questions received. The following attachments are included and are hereby incorporated into this solicitation: TWIC Questions and Responses, (Amended) Attachment D: Vendor Demonstration Scenario and (Amended) Attachment E: Price Scenario Worksheet.

1. What will be the driver in determining whether the USCG purchases 10 versus 300 devices?

Response: This initial delivery order for 10 TWIC Hand-Held readers will be issued concurrently with the Contract. Additional delivery orders depend upon operational need and availability of funds.

2. On what date will the demonstrations begin?

Response: Product Demonstrations will be held from 11 August 2008 through 14 August 2008 at the United States Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, DC. After the receipt of proposals, Vendors will be provided with available time slots.

3. Is this opportunity related to the sources sought notice that was released awhile back for TWIC Hand Held Readers under # HSCG2307IMMN664? Also is this a new requirement, or is some one else currently doing the work?

Response: Yes this is related to the sources sought notice (HSCG23-08-I-MMN450) posted back in April 2008 and this is a new requirement.

4. May we break the CLIN 00002 into quantities of 10 units by approximate zone of destination? Since the destination ports span a wide geographic area, your cost comparison projections may be improved if we inform you of shipping options (overnight, 2-day, ground) by a comparable quantity across USCG Districts.

Response: Yes as long as there is a Grand Total Price for all 300 TWIC Hand-Held readers for price evaluation. Any proposal without a Grand Total Price may be rejected.

5. For the requested Quantity Discounts, would annual volume pricing bands between different quantity levels be most helpful? Volume bands may assist allocation of costs between individual port locations, and can be broken out to be very granular.

Response: See response to Question 4.

6. Please confirm that Specification # 40A through 40F in the USCG TWIC Portable Biometric Reader specification are Objectives versus Threshold requirements.

Response: Yes they are Objectives.

7. Can you let us know when (how soon after Aug 1 close date) and what city the intended Product Demonstrations are going to be scheduled

Response: See response to Question 2.

8. What is the anticipated contract award date?

Response: On or before 30 September 2008.

9. In Attachment A, Section 1.3.3 Employee Identification, FIPS 201 compliant credentials may be available for employees (depending on their expected length of time on the contract).  Are you stating that a separate credential (showing clearance level) is required for personnel working on this contract?

Response: No

10. In Attachment A, Section 1.13 Intellectual Property, is it the government’s intent that any development under this contract would be considered government use licensing?

Response: Yes. In reference to Attachment A, Section 1.13 Intellectual Property, the Government shall own such rights to modifications made during the performance of the contract.

11. In Attachment A, Section 5.1.5 Inspection and Acceptance of the TWIC Hand-held Readers, please identify all functionality required in order for the hand-held readers to be considered in accordance with the USCG’s Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V).

Response: This USCG’s Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) will be provided after contract award.

12. RFP Reference: Solicitation, page 2, “CLIN 0002:  Delivery (FOB Destination).”
Question: What numbers of units per shipment should bidders use for CLIN 0002?

Response: The initial delivery order and shipment will be for 10 TWIC Hand-Held readers. Additional delivery orders and shipments depend upon operational need and availability of funds. In accordance with the solicitation, it is preferred that a standard delivery price (s) be quoted (F.O.B Destination) for the readers.

13. RFP Reference: Solicitation, page 2, “CLIN 0004:  Travel (excluding travel for training shall not exceed $25,000).”
Question: Are labor costs associated with CLIN 0004 included in the $25,000 figure? If not, will the USCG be opening a different CLIN for labor?

Response: There will be no labor costs associated with CLIN 0004.

14. RFP Reference: Solicitation, page 7, Proposal Page Limit
Question: Will the USCG consider the use of “11x17 fold-outs” for graphics as part of the page limit?

Response: Yes

15. RFP References: Attachment A, Section 5.1.4 Software Updates and Table 7.1 Deliverables and Delivery Schedule; Attachment B, Line 7D

“Attachment B, Line 7D: The reader shall also read the Seafarers’ Identity Documents (SID) and conduct a comparison of the individuals biometric to the template stored in the bar code. – THRESHOLD”

“5.1.4 Software Updates: Based on current versions of the TSA TWIC reader hardware and card application specification, the Contractor shall provide fully tested software updates to the TWIC hand-held readers after the COTR approves that these software updates are necessary. The Contractor shall also provide software patches as needed. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to be aware when current versions of the TSA TWIC reader hardware and card application specification are made available and if software updates are needed.

“Table 7.1 Deliverables and Delivery Schedule: 30 days after current versions of the TSA TWIC reader hardware and card application software is released.

Question: This is an open-ended requirement within a FFP contract and does not address modifications to the TWIC/SID specifications that may affect fundamental changes in hardware as well as software. Will the USCG define such hardware and software updates as a separate contract line item number (CLIN) subject to price and scope negotiation on an as-needed basis?

Response:  Yes. Attachment E (TWIC Price Scenario Worksheet) has been amended to include this new CLIN structure and it is subject to negotiation after contract award.

16. RFP Reference: Section 5.1.5 of Attachment A to the Solicitation
Question: Will a copy of the USCG’s Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) criteria be provided?

Response: See response to Question 11.

17. Page 3, first paragraph, under 1) Technical Capability: b) – is the inclusion of product literature required or optional?  The word used here is “should”.

Response: If the product literature is an essential component of the proposal then it is recommended that it should be included. Please note that the product literature is included in the page limit.

18. Page 3: 2) product demonstration; is the contractor limited to 45 minutes?  Is this a defined cut-off point in the demo?

Response: Yes, the demonstration is limited to 45 minutes

19. Page 4: 5) Relevant Past Performance: can you define further the language that asks that past performance descriptions pertain to readers that are the “same as or similar to the requirements specified in the above specifications and PWS”?  Since the TWIC specifications are relatively new and there have only been pilots heretofore as part of TWIC phase III, it is highly unlikely that readers will have a track record in TWIC usage under the current specifications.  Therefore, what constitutes “similar to the requirements”?

Response: It is understood that the TWIC Hand-Held requirements are relatively new however “same as or similar to” in this solicitation would refer to for example other “same as or similar” biometric readers.

20. Page 7: Proposal Page Limit: does the font size limitation for Volume II also apply to Volume I?

Response: Yes.

21. Attachment A: 1.3.3.  Employee Identification: who is responsible for supplying the required identification badge?

Response: The United States Coast Guard

22. Should the ORCA be sent in paper form?

Response: No, please reference the online link in the price proposal.

23. In the referenced FAR clause, 52.212-5, you indicated that clauses 14 - 21 were applicable.  Clause 14 indicates a total service-disabled veteran-owned set-aside.  Is this correct?

Response: No. Please disregard this clause. The resultant contract will omit the clause.

24. Should we assume that the maximum 12 training courses for CLIN 00003 will be conducted in the Washington, DC Headquarters and leverage your facilities? We may utilize a zone-based approach for geographically-dispersed training and save your team's travel time and expenses by doing so. Also, use of your current facilities will save costs for rental of appropriate training space.

Response: In addition to the USCG Headquarters in Washington DC, other training locations could include the USCG units in Western Rivers, Gulf Coast, Great Lakes, West Coast and other East Coast Locations.

25. What other activities are potentially envisioned for travel requirements encompassed by CLIN 00004 outside of the Kick-Off meeting and occasional status meetings by purpose and frequency? Our team is adept at utilizing virtual meeting facilities, including online conferencing and secure online forums, and can potentially save travel costs.

Response: There are no other activities envisioned for travel requirements outside of the Kick-Off meeting and occasional status meetings.

26. Please clarify the TWIC and PIV Specification with the Two TWIC Cards Presented Simultaneously Use Case (Demonstration Scenario 5).  

a.	It’s not clear what the term “reject” means. Does it mean that an error is displayed/logged, or can the card presentation just be ignored?

Response: Both cards should be ignored as if none were presented. Attachment D (TWIC Vendor Demonstration Scenario) has been amended.

b.	Page 30 of the May 30, 2008 TSA TWIC specification says: “If two or more contactless smart cards are presented at the same time in a TWIC reader's contactless field, the TWIC reader shall reject all of the presented cards.”  This contradicts the FIPS201 specification, which requires FIPS201 cards to meet standards defined in the ISO/IEC 14443 specification for contactless readers, and contradicts the standard anti-collision mechanisms as defined in ISO/IEC 14443-3:2001. Having a contradicting requirement will make multi-mode (e.g., PIV + TWIC) readers impossible. 

Response: Resolving anti-collision may or may not be supported by a reader (PCD). The ISO/IEC 14443-3:2001 standard limits requirements on the reader (PCD) to requiring “detection” of multiple cards (PICC) in the operating field.  There is no language in this standard mandating a reader resolves a collision.

c.	This requirement is difficult or impossible to meet on some platforms with drivers that automatically perform anti-collision detection. The driver may serialize the card presentations to the terminal as though they were presented one after the other. The reader is not even aware of the multiple-card presentation, so it can’t reject the cards.

Response: Respondents are encouraged to create new (or modify existing) drivers to support the required behavior of ignoring multiple cards presented at the same time.

27. Please clarify the CHUID with Biometrics Verification Use Case (Demonstration Scenario 2).  

a.	In the CHUID With Biometrics Verification Use Case Scenario Purpose Section, may we assume that the TWIC cards for persons Alpha and Beta have been registered?

Response: The Hand Held should be configured for CHUID with biometric identification mode.  Registration of TWICs into a PACS is not necessary. Attachment D (TWIC Vendor Demonstration Scenario) has been amended.

b.	Is it correct to assume that the TWIC cards may first be presented to a contact reader contained on the handheld, the TPKs read and temporarily stored on the handheld, and then the TWIC card would then be presented to the contactless interface as described in the procedures?

Response: If a reader is using the contact interface for a transaction, there is no need to begin the transaction as a contact session and then switch “in the middle” to a contactless session; all the information required to perform a biometric match should be retrieved over the contact interface in a single session.   [Refer to Table 4.3 on Page 23 of the TWIC Reader Hardware and Card Application Specification]

28. Please clarify the CHUID with Biometrics Verification Using Wrong Cardholder Use Case (Demonstration Scenario 4).

a.	To meet the May 30, 2008 TSA TWIC specification will you allow the following scenario: the TWIC cards may first be presented to a contact reader contained on the handheld, the TPKs read and temporarily stored on the handheld, the TWIC card would then be presented to the contactless interface as described in the procedures? 

Response: If a reader is using the contact interface for a transaction, there is no need to begin the transaction as a contact session and then switch “in the middle” to a contactless session; all the information required to perform a biometric match should be retrieved over the contact interface in a single session.   [Refer to Table 4.3 on Page 23 of the TWIC Reader Hardware and Card Application Specification]

b.	We want to comply with Table 4.3 on  Page 23 of the May 30, 2008 TSA TWIC specification; "the TPK required to decipher it may be obtained from three possible sources: the magnetic stripe of the card, the contact interface of the TWIC card application, or from the PACS system"

Response: The information in Table 4.3 is meant to detail all available methods for obtaining the TWIC Privacy Key.  What TPK retrieval methods are supported is dependent on reader configuration.  For the USCG’s Hand Held TWIC readers, the TPK may be obtained from the magnetic stripe or the contact interface. The USCG Hand Held TWIC readers will not interface with a PACS. 

29. Please clarify the Minimum of One Second of Time Between Card Presentations Use Case (Demonstration Scenario 8). 

a.	Under Procedure Item 4. Restore privileges of Person Alpha in the PACS prior to starting another scenario, this does not fit with the Reference(s).

Response: Regarding scenario #6 (on page 8), procedure #4 can be ignored since PACS are irrelevant for the USCG Hand Held TWIC reader.

30. The combined solicitation synopsis and PWS states that the reader must be interoperability with the SID (Seafarer’s card) and references Appendix D (Vendor Demonstration Scenario).  As we read the Appendix D of the TWIC reader spec, it refers to AID and ATRs related to CACs and other types of PIV/FIPS 201 credentials.  Is USCG requesting interoperability around the 2-D PDF 417 Seafarers card or DOD Common Access Card (CAC) or both?

Response: Minimum requirements are TWIC and SID.  Other capabilities can be detailed in the RFP response.

31. In attachment B (USCG TWIC Specification), Specification #7D reads:  The reader shall also read the Seafarers’ Identity Documents (SID) and conduct a comparison of the individuals biometric to the template stored in the bar code. – THRESHOLD.  7A-C requires the reader to have contact and contactless smart card read capabilities. The ILO card is neither a contact nor contactless smart card.  What type of mechanism is expected to read the Seafarer’s card as you cannot use a contact or contactless interface based on the Seafarer’s card technology? 

Response: Bar Code.  

32. Is it USCG intent to require multiple bar code standards to be utilized (TWIC / PIV and ILO)? 

Response: No, only bar code read for SID.

33. Is there an issue related to liability for a vendor if it reads a card for the USCG based on an ILO treaty, that has not been ratified by the US, governing the use of the Seafarer’s card?
Response: No.

34. How does the USCG plan to do a validity check of the status of the mariner based on the SID?  Is there a System of Record that stores the status of mariners?

Response: The only requirement at this time is to conduct a biometric match for SID.

35. Is there a national database in the US or another country that can be accessed for the purposes of this RFP per ILO 185 Article 4?

Response: See the response to question 34. 

36. Does the USCG anticipate real time connections to any ILO 185 national databases at the time of the transaction between USCG Handheld and the SID?

Response: See the response to question 34. 

37. Where can test SIDs be obtained?

Response: The USCG will not provide test SIDs.  

38. Can you confirm that only the demonstration scenarios in Appendix D will be required and no other product functionality is required in order to be selected? Given the window of 1 hour for demonstrations, there are some requirements in Appendix B (i.e. battery life of 12 hours) that cannot be demonstrated.

Response: Yes.  All other requirements must be addressed in the written response to the RFP.

39. For the CHUID with biometrics verification scenario, can this be performed alternatively via the contact interface, since you can obtain the TPK and CHUID and perform a successful 1:1 match via the contact interface and will be a faster transaction since you do not need to hold the card to the contactless reader, swipe the mag stripe (to obtain TPK), and then place the finger on the reader? 

Response: If a reader is using the contact interface for a transaction, there is no need to begin the transaction as a contact session and then switch “in the middle” to a contactless session; all the information required to perform a biometric match should be retrieved over the contact interface in a single session.   [Refer to Table 4.3 on Page 23 of the TWIC Reader Hardware and Card Application Specification]

40. For the CHUID with biometrics verification scenario using the wrong cardholder, can this be performed alternatively via the contact interface, since you can obtain the TPK and CHUID and perform a successful 1:1 match via the contact interface and will be a faster transaction since you do not need to hold the card to the contactless reader, swipe the mag stripe (to obtain TPK), and then place the finger on the reader? 

Response: If a reader is using the contact interface for a transaction, there is no need to begin the transaction as a contact session and then switch “in the middle” to a contactless session; all the information required to perform a biometric match should be retrieved over the contact interface in a single session.   [Refer to Table 4.3 on Page 23 of the TWIC Reader Hardware and Card Application Specification]

41. For any of the testing scenarios, if a portable reader does not have contactless capability, can a contact only version be submitted?  Conversely, can a supplier submit only a contactless portable reader?

Response: No.  The threshold requirement is for both a contact and contactless portable reader.

42. Do the readers need to be on the FIPS 201 APL prior to the Aug 1 date?

Response: No.

43. In testing scenario #1, the procedure calls for CHUID read and verification within 2 seconds.  Can you clarify what you mean by verification of CHUID?  Can you clarify how the time measurement will be obtained?

Response: Verification of the CHUID within 2 seconds means the reader performs a contactless read of the CHUID (signed or unsigned), performs any internal data validation tasks (for this mode), and subsequently indicates the presence or displays the CHUID based on the processed information.  The time will be measured from the read to the final indication.

44. Can you clarify that the use of the TWIC CRL for obtaining status information “Section 6, 4th paragraph “A portable TWIC reader shall be capable of downloading and using the most recent TWIC Hotlist. A portable TWIC reader may support a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) subject to availability of a network connection”.  Is an acceptable means for obtaining validity status of the TWIC? 
Response: The TWIC Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is maintained by the TWIC program along with the Hot List.  To use a CRL the reader would need to read the serial number of at least one of the X.509 certificates (e.g. the Card Authentication certificate) held in the PIV card application and check if this serial number appears on the TWIC CRL.  The CRL check is presumed to be done using a network connection.  Alternatively the FASC-N can be checked to see if it appears on the Hot List.  The Hot List is presumed to be loaded on the portable reader on a regular basis and will be used without a network connection.

45. In attachment B, Specification 11C, do want to display the whole CHUID or just the FASC-N.  Can you explain what data elements of the CHUID you expect to see on the Handheld reader screen?  Is the expectation that the whole data block of the CHUID be displayed on the screen of the reader?  If so, what is the value of displaying the whole CHUID to an operator?  This number value does not have any human related value that could be of interest to make an access decision.

Response: As a back-up, enough information, including the expiration date, should be visible to the operator to allow for a manual check against the TSA published hotlist.

46. In attachment B, Specification 15, do you mean 1 model/version for USCG purposes since these are not for the ports themselves?

Response: 1 model/version for the USCG.

47. In attachment B, Specification 15, do you intend for the manufacturer to keep an inventory of the selected baseline device for warranty replacement purposes or new purchases?  If so, what is the expected maximum quantity that the USCG expects the manufacturer to have available in that configuration?  How does the USCG expect the manufacturer to address production component replacement/hardware upgrades that are required due to component obsolescence?

Response: The USCG expects that as a delivery order is placed, a TWIC Hand-Held reader will be delivered by the time specified in the order.

48. In attachment B, Specification 18, does this mean you are requiring the log-in to the device to be via the USCG issued CACs-similar to CAC log-in onto a desktop/laptop PC and use of the CAC per HSPD-12?

Response: No.

49. In Attachment B, Specification 8, how is the USCG determining primary versus secondary biometric?  Is this the 2nd fingerprint biometric on the TWIC?

Response: The biometric template contains, in most cases, two fingerprint minutiae patterns.  The quality value of each fingerprint is detailed in the biometric template.

50. In attachment B, all of the requirements related to the portable media are “Objective” except for #26.  “The reader shall have a cleanup utility to remove all records and data after uploading to portable media – THRESHOLD”.  Is this also supposed to be “Objective” to be consistent with all other portable media requirements in this document?

The display values are meant to be illustrative and not a requirement”.   Does the USCG agree with this approach from TSA or is the requirement in Attachment B supposed to be a requirement or illustrative?

Response: 7-days per week

56. Attachment A: 5.1.3.  What is the intended process for downloading the TWIC hotlist to the mobile device, e.g. thumb drive, daily PC connection, wireless connection, etc.  What is the intended frequency of doing so?

Answer: The Hot List is updated daily from TSA and it is presumed a daily download can be accommodated via thumb drive or similar process.

57. Please, clarify\define the purpose of the TWIC BAA Request, versus the recently requested TWIC RFP Solicitation.

Answer: These two announcements represent different requirements, as documented in the body of each announcement.  Among other differences, the US Coast Guard's RFP is solely related to handheld readers, while the TSA BAA is related to both handheld and fixed readers.  Interested parties should read both announcements and their corresponding instructions carefully to ascertain the differences between the announcements.

SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<p><br />2. Changed documents (marked with asterisk) and additional documents attached to this amendment and incorporated to the solicitation are: <br />Attachment 1 - PWS with Appendix *1 and *1A <br />Appendix 2 and 3 provided to awardee only<br />Appendixes 4 - 6 are included in PWS<br />*Attachment 3 - Proposal Sched Exh A-K KTR Fill-in 7 Jul 08</p>

<p>4. Change Attachment 3 - Proposal Sched Exh A-K KTR Fill-in 25Jun08, to show formula adjustments.</p>
<p>5. The waterless urinals for PAFB have a life time cartridge installed in them. CLIN 0008 is for CMAFS. CMAFS has one or two waterless urinals installed currently. Manufacture is Sloan. Model number is WES-1000. The contractor is to replace the CMAFS waterless urinal cartridges.</p>
<p>6. Question: Amendment 1 Q &amp; A #5 states "Currently, there is a day porter for each facility". Does this mean there is one (1) FTE at CFMAS for Bldg. DV Route as well as one (1) FTE for Bldg 101/617, one (1) FTE for Bldg 1000 Rm 1207 - 1211. For PAFB one (1) FTE at CFMAS for Bldg. 560/570, one (1) FTE for Bldg 1350, one (1) FTE for Bldg 1350/1525 , one (1) FTE for Bldg 1555? <br />Amendment 1, Attch 10 Q and A from 28 May - 17 June 08 Solicitation Amendment 1 .doc, Question #5 reads.<br />5. PWS 1.1.2.1.1 and 1.1.2.1.2 States spills need to be cleaned within 15 minutes. Does this contract require a <br />worker to be full time at the Child Development Center and Gym during open hours?<br />Appendix 1, Special Cleaning, first row - 4th column, states, "Day custodians required to perform continuous <br />inspection and cleaning of tasks marked 2D." Currently, there is a day porter for each facility. Because of the nature <br />of the requirements for cleaning, it is likely there will be a need for increased service during certain times of the day. <br />Contractors shall meet the requirements of the PWS paragraphs 1.1.2.1.1 and 1.1.2.1.2.<br />Answer: No, there is not a porter at any facilities on CMAFS. This statement only appears on the Appendix 1, PAFB, Special Cleaning tab, first row-4th column and the PWS paragraphs stated in the previous answer only applies to PAFB. Therefore, the "each facility" applies only to the buildings listed in Appendix 1, Special Cleaning Tab.</p>
<p>7. Amendment 4 RFP released 16 Jul 08, Page 3, Table of Contents is updated.</p>
<p>8. Amendment 4 RFP released 16 Jul 08, FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Proposal due date is changed to 31 July 08, at 1600hrs.</p>

We are currently awaiting DOL official response to determine the wage rate to use for both locations, PAFB and CMAFS. We expect this determination optimistically on Monday, 21 July 08.</p>

All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.

The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.

Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities. 
Evaluation Factors For Award:  Prospective offers are required to submit a technical and business proposal as discussed herein.  Proposals will be technically evaluated as either "acceptable" or "not acceptable" on the basis of the following criteria.  
a)	Contractor Qualificationsb)	Past Performancec)	Qualifications of Key Personneld)	Course content and outline
The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation terms and conditions, and represents the best value to the Government.  Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable' in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration.  One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc.  The Government is seeking offers which provide the best combination of attributes and price in order to select the greatest value or "best buy" offer.  Therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offer based on the evaluation criteria as previously provided through the SIR.
Proposal Content:  A prospective offeror must submit a complete technical and business proposal, which will encompass, but is not limited to, the content specified herein.  All technical and business proposal areas must be fully addressed.  A negative response is required in the event of no experience for a particular area, or for any item that is not applicable.  Any omission or partial and vague responses may lead to the rejection of the offeror's proposal without discussions with the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to use and evaluate any and all available information pertinent to any offeror and its subcontractors, in addition to the data incorporated in the submitted technical and business proposals, and which may be related to performance periods beyond the last three (3) years.
Tiered Evaluation Of Proposals:  A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in this source selection.  Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns were received.  Once offers are received the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified in this SIR.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next higher lettered tier until award can be made.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):
a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).c)	Very small business.d)	Small business.e)	Other-than small business.
Response submittals must include the following information:
a)   Name of companyb)   Addressc)   Phone and Fax numberd)   Point of contacte)   Email addressf)   Business size status (8(a), Small Business, SDVOSB, VSB, etc.)g)   Verification of registration in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR)h)   Any other pertinent information
Any offeror who believes they can meet the FAA requirements and estimate within the established timeframes is requested to provide supporting qualifications, technical proposal, and cost proposal by July 22, 2008.  
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email at pat.workman@faa.gov Fax, (425) 227-1055.
Non-electronic submittals should be sent to:

<SUBJECT>CTSA Process Evaluation
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-RR-PB-2008-200-DE

<CONTACT>Donald L Ervin, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0365, Fax (301) 480-3345, Email ervindl@mail.nih.gov - Kathleen J. Marsden, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0364, Fax (301) 480-3345, Email km66x@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Center for Research (NCRR) is seeking a professional services contract to procure a contractor to conduct a process evaluation of the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) consortium.  The objective of this requirement is to provide the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with an overview of best business practices as it relates to starting a new center program.  The process evaluation will also provide input into the overall outcome evaluation.  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is engaged in a series of initiatives, collectively known as the “NIH Roadmap for Medical Research”(http://nihroadmap.nih.gov), that promote clinical and translational investigation and aim to improve health and prevent disease. In October 2005, the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), on behalf of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, launched the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) consortium to re-engineer the clinical research enterprise. The goal of the CTSA consortium is to transform the local, regional and national environment for clinical and translational science, thereby increasing the efficiency and speed of clinical and translational research. This transformation is to be achieved by creating an academic home, which can be a Center, Department, or Institute (C/D/I), as determined by institutional circumstances that supports the discipline of clinical and translational research. The C/D/I is expected to include faculty able to conduct original research, develop graduate and postgraduate training curricula and lead programs that integrate clinical and translational science across multiple departments, schools, clinical and research institutes, and hospitals. Members of the CTSA consortium are expected to work together and adopt and disseminate best practices, policies, procedures, and other measures to advance collaborative clinical and translational research and to reduce burden on individual investigators at all academic health centers. Such collaboration will be achieved primarily through the formation of national steering committees on topics such as community engagement, informatics, communications, public-private partnerships, translational research, and others.

The CTSA consortium is a trans-NIH initiative with several trans-NIH working groups that are critical to the management of the CTSA consortium. Two key working groups are the CTSA Project Team, including representatives from all 27 of the NIH ICs, and the IC Director Advisory Board for Oversight of the CTSA consortium, including a rotating Director membership of 6 IC directors. 

NIH awarded 12 CTSAs in FY 2006 totaling $108 million and 12 CTSAs and in FY 2007 totaling $99 million. NIH expects to increase the number of CTSA awards annually so that by 2012, 60 CTSAs will receive a total of approximately $500 million per year.

For more information about the CTSA program, visit: http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/clinicaldiscipline.asp.
http://www.ctsaweb.org

While the CTSA consortium is designed to give institutions the flexibility to develop an appropriate academic home for clinical and translational science, all CTSA institutions are expected to contribute to the following goals of the program: 

•	provide opportunities and resources for original research on novel methods and approaches to translational and clinical science; 
•	provide the translational technologies and knowledge base for the spectrum of clinical and translational science, including all types and sizes of studies and specialties; 
•	integrate translational and clinical science by fostering collaboration between departments and schools of an institution;
•	provide for biomedical informatics and data management;
•	develop partnerships with industry, foundations and community physicians;
•	provide research education, training and career development leading to an advanced degree (Masters or Ph.D.) for the next generation of clinical and translational researchers (including physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and other allied health professionals);
•	conduct self-evaluation activities and participate in a national evaluation of the CTSA program. 

II. Purpose of the Process Evaluation/Key Study Questions

This evaluation will focus on processes associated with implementing the various aspects of the CTSA program, including the use of the CTSA Consortium to identify best practices and barriers to implementation. In order to determine if the overall CTSA program goals are being met, the process of implementing the program through the Consortium are vitally important aspects of the evaluation of the new and complex infrastructure program such as the CTSA.  

This study will include an initial pilot-testing of the research design including data collection procedures and instruments. Based on this pilot testing, the process evaluation design will be refined before it goes full scale.  The findings from the process evaluation will be extremely useful in contextualizing both short and long term outcomes of the CTSA program on its designated goals.  

The CTSA program is an important program initiative within the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. The CTSA program will complement the programs of the NIH Institutes and will work in cooperation with other NIH Roadmap activities and other relevant trans-NIH activities.  

The National CTSA Process Evaluation seeks to understand and track processes to implement a program as large in scope as the CTSA.  The Consortium as a whole is charged with reengineering the clinical research enterprise through transforming the environment for clinical translational science at every level, from local to national, thereby increasing the efficiency and speed of clinical translational research.  Without an understanding of the process of implementation, the potential impact of the program will be poorly understood.  The goals of the process evaluation are the following:

•	Assess the mechanism of a National Consortium to create a collaborative community among the CTSA institutions that coordinates national efforts to re-engineer the biomedical research enterprise through facilitating clinical translational research and multidisciplinary research approaches.
•	Assess the activities that facilitate post-CTSA clinical translational research conducted by the institutions.
•	Assess the reduction of duplicative and/or redundant work processes associated with the conduct and management of clinical translational research projects.
•	Development of an approach to an integrated and comprehensive curriculum to train clinical translational scientists.
•	Understand the characteristics of the CTSA trainees, scholars, and mentors.
•	Assess strategies for re-organization within the CTSA institutions as they implement the program, especially with respect to the cooperation and collaboration among the departments, schools, and outside organizations in clinical translational research.

The 6 CTSA process evaluation study questions (some of which have multiple parts) are as follows:

1.	How have the CTSA institutions formed an integrated National CTSA Consortium? What has the Consortium developed as priorities and action plans? How has NIH participated in the National CTSA Consortium?
2.	How do the CTSA institutions integrate clinical translational science at their institutions? How does the Consortium influence this integration?  What are the models used by CTSA institutions to develop an ‘academic home’ for clinical translational research?
3.	How has the CTSA program developed strategies to recruit, retain, and support the career advancement (promotion and tenure) of clinical translational science researchers? 
4.	What mechanisms are developed and used to increase translation of basic research into clinical studies? Involve community level clinicians into research? Improve feedback from clinical studies and community clinicians back to basic research?
5.	How does the CTSA program disseminate new methods, tools, and resources into community clinical practice?
6.	How does the CTSA program develop relationships with community based organizations and other outreach mechanisms?  Develop strategies for increasing public knowledge of, support for, and involvement in clinical translational science?

<DESC><p>AMENDMENT 01- HEREBY ISSUED TO CHANGE CLOSING DATE OF THIS NOTICE TO CLOSE OF BUSINESS JULY 23, 2008.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This publication serves as notice of intent to procure
services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp;
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute
(TSMRI), located in Juneau, AK, on a sole source basis with Dan Folley owner
and operator of ORV STELLER. The government intends to acquire services using
FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Auke Bay Laboratories (ABL) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center
(AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS will use<span>&nbsp; </span>chartered vessel STELLER to continue annual
monitoring of oceanographic conditions and abundance of juvenile salmon and
ecologically-related species in strait and inshore habitats of southeastern
Alaska from 25 July to 01 August, 2008. This is the twelve year of sampling
conducted by the Southeast Coastal Monitoring (SECM) project in the region.
Operations will involve sampling 9 of the historical SECM core stations in the
northern region. This is seven and a half day cruise that will originate and
terminate at the NMFS Subport in Juneau. The principal scientific objectives
are to collect biological and oceanographic samples with a CTD profiler,
plankton nets, and a Nordic surface rope trawl in the marine waters of the
northern region of southeastern Alaska. Collect oceanographic data at 9
stations associated with seasonal trawling: 1) CTD cast; 2) Standard plankton
hauls [NORPAC 20-m vertical, deep double oblique bongo,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and deep WP-2 (only at ABM)], to be
preserved; 3) Surface water samples (nutrients and chlorophyll), to be frozen;
and 4) Conduct comparative trawling (up to 28 hauls) with<em> Medeia</em> in northern region. Due to the importance on maintaining
the continuity of an existing 11 year oceanographic and biological time series,
an immediate vessel capable of executing this research is needed. The vessel
needs to be equipped for surface trawling for juvenile salmon with a NORDIC 264
rope trawl (20 X 24 m opening) and to conduct oceanographic research with
various plankton nets and temperature/salinity profilers. The STELLER, operated
by Mr. Dan Foley, has previously been chartered by the Auke Bay Laboratories in
April and June of this year. The vessel platform has previously proven its
capabilities to use the required trawl and oceanographic sampling gear. The
government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with a period of
performance that will commence from date of award and will end Sept 30, 2008.&nbsp; See Numbered Note 1, 100% set-aside to small business concerns. All
interested concerns must submit documentation demonstrating qualifications to
provide services as described above within 15 days of the publication date of
this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This
notice may represent the only official notice. <span>&nbsp;</span>This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated
value of less than $100,000.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>****The
Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing
business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor
Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.<span>&nbsp; </span>After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in
CCR.<span>&nbsp; </span>For additional information and to
register in CCR please access the following web site: <span class="MsoHyperlink">http://www.ccr.gov.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>In order to register with the CCR and to be
eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must
have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be
acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at <a href="http://www.dnb.com/eupdate">www.dnb.com/eupdate</a> or by phone at (800)
333-0505. All contractors are also required to complete online Representations

<DESC>NAICS Code: 339111   NACIS Code: 339111 The purpose of Amendment No. 2 to RFQ-NY-08-00012 is to address questions/answers and to incorporate revisions and attachments into the RFQ.The following questions and answers regarding the technical specifications for RFQ-NY-08-00012 are hereby provided:1.  Can the lock-down feature of the mobile cabinets be lockable castors?Answer:  Lockable castors are an acceptable feature for the mobile cabinets.2.  There is only (1) blue color for epoxy resin.  It is a dark blue.  The only matching that can take place between blue epoxy and laminates is finding a standard laminate color which will be acceptable.  Special order colors from laminate manufacturers and epoxy manufacturers are not possible. Answer:  A medium to dark blue is being requested.3.  Can the edges of the epoxy counters be a 45 degree bevel and not be rounded off?Answer:  A 45 degree bevel is acceptable for countertop edges.  The Sanitary Laboratory Furniture Specifications and the SanitarybayCRFQ5.xls drawing are modified to reflect this change.4.  Our supplier of metal casework normally supplies a full extension slide on drawers.  This feature in not only very strong but allows the researcher to pull the drawer fully out of the cabinet.  This allows good visibility of the drawer's contents.  Self-closing full extension slides are available but they are very expensive.  I do not know of any manufacturer who manufactures a self-centering slide.  Not sure what you mean by "hold-open feature" on a drawer slide.  All the drawers, on a cabinet which is leveled, will stay open manually unless they are pushed shut.  Is the "hold-open" feature on the drawer slide to stop the drawer from accidentally closing? Answer:  The "hold-open" feature allows the self-closing drawer to remain open, if desired.  The self-centering feature is hereby deleted from the Sanitary Laboratory Furniture Specifications.5. Request was made for additional information on the Line Item #45 of the Material List. Not sure what this item is.  Will need at least a hand sketch of this item.Answer:  See attachment entitled portable desk birri.dwg.The following revisions are made to RFQ No. PR-NY-08-00012:Paragraph 2 is deleted and replaced as follows:The EPA intends to issue one fixed price purchase order to the responsible vendor whose quote most closely conforms to the specifications, drawings and evaluation criteria set forth in the RFQ.  No 10 of the RFQ Instructions is modified (in capital letters) as follows:10)  In order to be considered responsive, vendors must address each specification listed under attachment Sanitary Laboratory Furniture Specifications and follow instructions above.  Vendors  must include sufficient descriptive material to permit the Government to determine IF the proposed response will meet the technical specifications stated in RFQ.  CAD drawings showing the layout of all proposed furniture must be included in the quote package.Paragraph 2 of Clause 212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items in the Attachment entitled "RFQ-NY-00012 Commercial Clauses"  is deleted and replaced as follows:The following factors, in descending order of importance, are to be used for evaluation purposes:1.  Furniture that most closely conforms to the requirements, dimensions and configuration as described in the attached drawings and specifications.2.  PriceItem 5 of the Sanitary Laboratory Furniture Specifications in the Attachment entitled "RFQ-00012 SOW" is modified (in capital letters)  to read as follows 
5. Color of all epoxy resin counter tops and shelves, as well as any laminates, must be closely matched in color: a medium-to-dark blue color is being requested - exact color to be determined upon acceptance of shop drawings. Edges of epoxy COUNTERtops MAY BE ROUNDED OR BEVELED 45 DEGREES.  Shelves must be rounded over. Epoxy tops should extend one inch over frames of casework, except at walls and be one inch thick.  Backsplashes and sidesplashes must be added whenever a countertop or shelf abuts a wall. Heavy duty supports must be utilized for all shelving.All countertop references in the attachment entitled "SanitarybayCRFQ5.xls" have been modified to read "or 45 DEGREE BEVELED" edge.  See attachment for specific changes.Interested sources can submit their request for the RFQ/Amendments via e-mail address  (lamela.yolanda@epa.gov)  Quotations are due on or before close of business:  July 23, 2008. All other terms and conditions of the solicitation remain the same.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the anticipated release date of the solicitation from 16 July 2008 to 25 July 2008.  

This notice is posted IAW FAR 5.203 and 5.204.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, intends to solicit and award one firm fixed priced contract for Environmental Remediation Services located at Cape Canaveral Air Station, FL, in the support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This action will be initiated under NAICS Code 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.   The subject solicitation will be set-aside for qualified small business concerns IAW FAR 19.502-2. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 25 July 2008 2008.  <BR><BR>SCOPE:  <BR><BR>The following is a summary of the proposed scope of services.  The actual scope of services will be released with the solicitation on or about 16 July 2008.  <BR><BR>Summary:<BR>The following is a brief summary of the proposed CCAFS Industrial Area Regional Treatment Basin planned to be constructed as a Regional Stormwater Improvement Project in the Industrial Area of CCAFS. The purpose/scope of the work plan, design, and stormwater treatment system is to: <BR>1. Manage (capture, route and treat) stormwater runoff from the western portion of the CCAFS Industrial Area (Regionalized Stormwater Basin permitted by SJRWMD), and <BR>2. Prevent (capture and treat) groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents (managed by the FDEP) in the Industrial Area of CCAFS from discharging to the Banana River Lagoon located along the western edge of the installation.   <BR><BR>The Banana River Lagoon has been designated an Outstanding Florida Water, a Federal Manatee Sanctuary, and is part of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.  Therefore, it is critical to prevent contamination from discharging into the Banana River Lagoon through a combination of stormwater management and groundwater capture and treatment.   <BR><BR>Project Approach:<BR>The current design is for the construction of a stormwater retention/treatment basin system on the west side of the CCAFS Industrial Area to capture stormwater runoff from the western portion of the CCAFS Industrial Area and groundwater/surface waters impacted (or potentially impacted) by chlorinated solvent contamination emanating from industrial area groundwater plumes.  It has been determined that contaminated groundwater can upwell into surface water swales, canals, and ditches that eventually discharge into the Banana River Lagoon. <BR>In addition to the retention/treatment basin, changes to the stormwater conveyance systems (ditches, swales, canals, etc.) in the CCAFS Industrial Area will be required to divert stormwater into the basin area. Aeration, volatilization, and phytoremediation shall be the primary methods used to remove volatile organic compounds from the basin water prior to discharge to the Banana River Lagoon. <BR><BR>The proposed improvement plan establishes two wet detention stormwater management areas. The wet detention areas consist of newly constructed lake areas connected by new conveyance swales, piping and control structure. Following the Primary system east of Scrub Jay Road, the overflow is piped to another wet detention system west of Scrub Jay Road for additional treatment.  The wet detention system discharges by control structure to a bubble-up system into a wetland area south of the 1798 canal.<BR><BR>Groundwater and surface water impacted with VOC will be captured and treated through a variety of treatment processing including: <BR>1. Air stripping/aeration/agitation treatment via a SolarBee (or equivalent) treatment unit in the main basin east of Scrub Jay Road <BR>2. Air stripping/aeration/agitation treatment via a solar powered aeration system in the secondary basin west of Scrub Jay Road <BR>3. Phytoremediation via wetland plant species uptake installed throughout the primary and secondary basin system <BR>4. Photoionization/Volatilization via sunlight surface exposure throughout the primary and secondary treatment basin systems <BR>5. Evapotranspiration via atmospheric conditions.  Evapotranspiration is considered to be one of the most significant influences in the pond system based on Floridas climatic conditions.  This process will be a significant factor in the drawdown of the pond surface water elevations to help ensure maximum groundwater plume capture. <BR>6. Air Stripping/treatment via agitation of surface water flow across various surface water features and structures throughout the basin treatment systems <BR><BR>The 1798 canal bubbler/aerator system will need to be removed and partially abandoned as part of the secondary basin construction efforts. The canal bubbler sparge legs will be removed and salvaged for replacement parts for other operation canal bubbler systems at CCAFS.  The blower unit and applicable infrastructure will be removed and temporarily stored or left in place (if unimpacted by construction activities) for future use as necessary.  If the proposed basin treatment system is unable to effectively remove VOC contaminants, the blower system can be retrofitted to provide more significant air stripping treatment in the secondary basin prior to discharge to the wetland system.  <BR><BR><BR>Basin Construction Activities:<BR>The primary construction activities to be conducted as part of the basin treatment system construction generally include: <BR>1. Remove and replace existing sanitary sewer line crossing (east/west) the primary basin foot print. The existing gravity feed sewer line will be replaced with a ductile iron pipe encased in a HDPE sleeve to allow double containment under the stormwater basin while allowing future access for maintenance as needed.<BR>2. Establishment of a truck haul route along Scrub Jay Road and the construction of a temporary bridge crossing over the FT-17 canal to emplace basin spoils in the permitted Titan Soil Staging Area.  Soil samples were collected and analyzed from various locations and depths within the basin footprint to determine re-use options.  All soil sample results were non-detect or below FDEP SCTLs and/or CCAFS background screening criteria.  Therefore, the soil meets the CCAFS clean fill criteria and will be staged at the Titan Soil Staging Area for future use as clean fill. <BR>3. Modify/deepen the existing stormwater conveyance swales and replace existing stormwater pipes to accommodate for the upstream basin.  Replace an array of aging, undersized pipes, which will convey stormwater to the regional treatment system.<BR>4. Excavation of the Primary Basin (east of Scrub Jay Road) and the Secondary Basin (west of Scrub Jay Road) along with the installation of a 20 ft wide access road surrounding both basins.<BR>5. Installation of two (2) primary control structures at the effluent of the primary basin and secondary basin to control water level elevations in the treatment systems.<BR>6. Installation of a bubble-up effluent discharge system into the wetland area south of the 1798 canal from Control Structure #2.<BR>7. Installation of a SolarBee Treatment System (or equivalent) in the Primary Basin and a Solar Powered Aeration Treatment System in the Secondary Pond.<BR>8. Modification of the 1798 Canal west of the secondary basin (see Drawing C-7) to allow for long term establishment of mangroves and other native species which interconnect with the Banana River. <BR><BR>PROCEDURE: <BR><BR>The Government will employ a best value approach in evaluating proposals using trade-off selection procedures as required by AFARS Subpart 5115.1 -- Source Selection Processes and Techniques. Evaluation factors may include technical approach, past performance, and price.  <BR><BR>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: <BR><BR>No responses to this announcement are required. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the RFP when issued.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Any costs incurred as a result of a response to this announcement shall be borne by the firm and will not be charged to the government for reimbursement.<BR><BR>The RFP will be electronically issued using the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Website (https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/).  When issued, the RFP may also be viewed via http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Technical data and supporting documentation will be made available for viewing via FedBizOpps.   <BR><BR>Written, telephonic, or fax requests for a solicitation package will NOT be accepted.

The project work location is at multiple U.S. Coast Guard sites including USCG Sector Houston-Galveston, Harris County, Texas, USCG SFO Galveston, Galveston County, Texas, USCG Station Freeport, Brazoria County, Texas, and USCG Station Sabine, Jefferson County, Texas. The project work includes but not limited to; providing and installing four (4) 24 ft x 60 ft single story Office Modular Buildings complete with interior fixtures, plumbing, HVAC, utilities, and electrical wiring including outlets and distribution panels. Work includes replacing existing pad-mounted transformers with new, and making all potable water and sanitary sewer connections to existing site utilities. Work also includes providing and installing new concrete vaulted 2,000 gal aboveground fuel tank, reuse and re-connect existing pump, and remove/properly dispose of existing 500 gal aboveground fuel storage tank, and construct new 10,000 SF concrete parking lot on exiting grass lot. The solicitation in its entirety and any amendments will be available at no charge online at http://www.fbo.gov under the above solicitation number. At the present time, this acquisition is expected to be issued as a Small Business set aside. However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HubZone certified or 19.1405, if your firm is SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to Deborah.J.Boydston@uscg.mil or by fax at (305)-278-6696.

Your response is required by July 15, 2008.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
