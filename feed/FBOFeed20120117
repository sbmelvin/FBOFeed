<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), 11720 Beltsville Drive, Suite 900, Beltsville, MD 20705-3166 for an analysis of the 2007 National Roadside Survey data. <br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541720, Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.
<p>PIRE conducted the 2007 National Roadside Survey, on behalf of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This survey collected data on children, youth, and adult passengers of drinking drivers, as well as data on the trip and the drinking drivers themselves. The survey contained information on a broad spectrum of persons who chose to ride with drinking drivers, an analysis of this data will allow the CDC to explore the relationship between drinking drivers and their passengers.</p>
<p>The 2007 National Roadside Survey was conducted by PIRE, and the data is proprietary. Therefore, PIRE is the only source capable of conducting an analysis of this data. There are no other recent surveys that collect information on the passenger, driver, and trip and provide information on the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of the driver and the amount of alcohol that the passenger ingested.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email <strong>ONLY</strong> at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-14331 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN&nbsp;February 2, 2012. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>Berta L Biltz, Email boh9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Serum Bank, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCID), has had an active, structured fresh blood and blood products acquisition program for the past decade. New requirements, especially testing of blood donations for hepatitis B and C and for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as, a need for strict confidentiality of records and donor counseling, when appropriate, dictate that the agency seek a contract for the acquisition of fresh human blood/blood products.<br />Blood collection and the need for fresh blood products are varied and important to the different programs at the CDC. Specialized fresh blood and blood products are used as reagents, biological products, control materials in research projects, and for reference diagnostic purposes. In general, fresh blood specimens are required 4-5 days per week, be in the investigators' laboratories within 2 hours or less of drawing and, because of the work schedules, be available before 08:00 am. Thus, the purpose of this procurement action is to acquire, on a timely basis, the blood and blood products testing, counseling and the required degree of confidentiality for blood donation viable for the research quality of the CDC.<br />Emory University is the incumbent contractor and already has a list of eligible donors who have specific rare blood types and titers required by CDC laboratories. Emory has the blood donors, readily available, that fit the profile for the specific blood types needed for CDC to conduct studies on various biological agents. Because expediency is required for many of the specimens to be viable for the research, their proximity to CDC premises gives them the unique advantage of providing these blood specimens to the CDC laboratories in the timely manner. Based on the above, we believe that no other source, but the Emory University in Atlanta, GA can realistically meet our needs. However, interested parties who believe they can provide the same service in a timely manner are encouraged to send a capability statement via email to Bbiltz@cdc.gov by COB, January 9, 2012.<br />Award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement IAW/FAR Part 13 is being contemplated. Individual call orders will be placed against the resulting BPA on the basis of Firm-Fixed Price (FFP). The total period of performance shall not exceed 60 continuous months from date of award.<br />All questions/concerns about the solicitation shall be submitted via e-mail ONLY to BBiltz@cdc.gov. No telephone requests will be honored. The associated NAICS code is 325414 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.

<p><br />The RVSS Upgrade procurement is one element of a broader CBP strategy to rapidly acquire non-developmental (and ideally commercially available) systems to support border protection efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology combines with other resources and capabilities, notably personnel, infrastructure, and intelligence, to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our border protection efforts.</p>
<p>The RVSS upgrade capability will provide enhanced persistent, wide area surveillance for detection, tracking, identification and classification of illegal entries. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The RVSS Upgrade consists of two parallel activities; (1) upgrade selected RVSS sites with newer capability and (2) install upgraded technology at new sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The currently existing RVSS utilizes multiple color cameras and thermal infrared detection video cameras and ancillary equipment, which are integrated into a remotely controlled system that can monitor and record activity within an Area of Responsibility (AoR) during both daytime and nighttime operations. The RVSS sensor images are transmitted via a dedicated communications sub-system to a Border Patrol Station where the information is processed, displayed, and where the USBP agent can monitor and control the system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Government expects the solicitation to be released via FEDBIZOPS on or about 31 January 2012 and is not seeking proposals from industry at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></p>

<p>Full and Open Competition based upon Best Value with a base and option quantities/periods.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:</span></p>
<p>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), single award contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract will be awarded for an initial site upgrade in the State of Arizona. Upon successful completion and Government acceptance of the initial site installation, the Government may at its option, exercise additional station AOR installs within Arizona and the state of Texas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Operation and maintenance of all sites is also contemplated under this contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance of this contract is anticipated to be ten years after contract award.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to increase the maximum order amount of contract NNG10AZ19C withCapital Technology Services Inc. (CTSI), pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only OneResponsible Source. This action will also extend the effective ordering period of thecontract. The Facilities Operations and Maintenance Services (FOMS) bridge contract is anIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with task orders issued on aCost Plus Fixed Fee basis. Quantities ordered under the contract schedule have exceededestimates and it is anticipated that the amount ordered under the contract will reach themaximum order amount on or about February 2012. The government is currently working onawarding a follow-on procurement for FOMS at GSFC which will not be awarded until the endof the calendar year. To avoid a break in service, the Government is increasing thecontract value of contract NNG10AZ19C and extending the ordering period until servicesstart on the follow-on FOMS contract. The current bridge contract supports GSFCsFacilities Management Division by providing the following services: operations,maintenance, and repair of all institutional GSFC facilities and collateral equipment andother related functions such as maintenance, Facilities Operations Console and buildingoperations; mission support to buildings 3/13/14/32; maintenance of uninterruptible powersupply units located throughout the Center; Center High Voltage and Center Power Plantservices; snow removal services; 24/7 hour support and response; institutional planning;and various IDIQ projects to support NASA missions.A break in service poses an unacceptable risk to the support of mission activities. CTSI,as the incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of the on-site facilities and systems andpersonnel to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical services. Aninterruption and restart of the services currently being performed, with a new contractorthat is unfamiliar with the existing facilities and the specific requirements of the FOMScontract, would greatly jeopardize the operation of Goddard facilities. Due to the timeand substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in anothercontractor, CTSI is considered the only contractor that can meet GSFCs needs given theshort period of performance before the award of the FOMS follow-on contract.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact, Yolanda Williams, email:yolanda.a.williams@nasa.gov, not later than 3:00 pm local time on January 31, 2012. Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

The proposed action provides access to CCT transit fare media for NRC employees for official travel. CCT only provides these services for 18 routes throughout the county. The other routes in the county are serviced by the Georgia Regional Transit Authority. The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. A determination may be made by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice and it is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation is available.

The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition is FAR Part 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), where only one responsible source and no other supply or service will satisfy agency requirements. CCT is the only licensed public transportation provider, for these 18 routes throughout Cobb County, that can provide the required services.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><strong>Objective and Background</strong>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information is to support a planned modification to the current FSSI Wireless Telecommunications Expense Management contract and support market research of a planned follow-on contract.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The portal services will enable improved management of wireless assets by providing ordering and reporting via a single, secure portal. This capability is currently on the TEMS contract. Additional TEMS services which are currently on the contract may be acquired individually beyond this portal service.  Service plans and devices procured through this portal are specified under other contract vehicles such as the FSSI Wireless BPA.  The ordering shall utilize the business portal interface that FSSI Wireless BPA awardee(s) will provide.  The current contract vehicle includes the Contract Line item Numbers (CLINs) which incorporate these basic functions.  The purpose of the modification is to enhance the current capabilities of these CLINs to further benefit the users of this contract.  The proposed method of establishing the additional CLIN for the Portal Services would be to take components of existing TEMS CLINs and redefine them into a single CLIN for the proposed Portal Services.  The new CLIN would be an optional CLIN that existing or new customers could then order as a managed service through the existing contract.  This method would ensure that the proposed new CLIN is within scope of the existing contract vehicle. It is fully anticipated that these portal requirements will be included in a follow-on program to TEMS.</p>
<p>The portal shall provide automation of transactions across multiple wireless carriers including moves, adds, changes, disconnects (MACDs) and their necessary agency coordination and approvals.</p>
<p>The ordering portal shall&#9472;</p>
<p><br />&bull;	Support the agency's defined workflow for coordinating and approving wireless service requisitions and allow for the assignment of individuals with specific workflow approval responsibilities or roles.

<p><strong>Utilization/Usage Reports</strong></p>
<p>The following summary reports shall be provided both to the Ordering Entity and to GSA in total for all WFSSI BPA contractors and for each contractor separately:<br />&bull;	Voice and data usage summary &#9472; Peak and non-peak usage (including any minutes or data used at no charge) for the overall contract vehicle and by Ordering Entity.  This report shall also provide a summary of each of the below detailed reports<br />&bull;	Detailed usage &#9472; Include peak and non-peak voice minutes and data use (i.e., number of Megabytes [MBs] or Gigabytes [GBs]), and text messages per device<br />&bull;	Overage &#9472; Breakdown of overage charges, such as extra data usage, shall be detailed per Agency Hierarchy Code (AHC) and per device <br />&bull;	Extra Charges Due to Usage &#9472; Breakdown of any usage for which there will be an extra charge, such as extra data usage, international and WPS usage.  These shall be detailed per AHC and per device<br />&bull;	Overage/underage &#9472; Units most over or most under plan including the amount that each unit is over or under plan in descending order starting with the unit most over or under plan.  The number of units in the report should be programmable.  It is encouraged that the user could choose whether the list should be measured from the total number of minutes or MBs over or under plan or whether it should be relative to the plan above or below that chosen.  The purpose of this is to help the Administrator decide which users should be moved into a different plan if there are pooling overage charges or if the entity is using far less than the number of pooling minutes or MBs than has been allocated<br />&bull;	Zero Usage &#9472; Lists each phone that has had no usage during the previous month and the number of consecutive months that the phone has had zero usage per AHC.  Report includes option to exclude devices that do not have any included minutes or MBs in plan.  Devices with the most zero usage months should be listed first.<br />&bull;	Cost Per MB-Equivalent - Average cost for MB-Equivalent to the customer agency where MB-equivalent is the sum of MB data transferred and voice minutes billed which are converted to MB based on agreed conversion rate.<br />&bull;	Average Cost Per User (ACPU) - Total cost per agency divided by the number of billed accounts.<br />These reports shall be based off the most recent data provided by the wireless service, which will be monthly at minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition Support</strong></p>
<p>Respondents are encouraged to indicate if they have any capabilities to provide acquisition support as an additional option.   Acquisition support is defined as the utilization of a Wireless Portal tool to support wireless acquisition at the agency or task order level where an agency would first insert its inventory into the Portal tool and then use the TEMS service to evaluate which proposal(s) are most advantageous to the agency developing the acquisition.  The acquisition support function could include the following capabilities:<br />&bull;	Coverage: Geographical  analysis of vendor offering or other data analysis of coverage quality, technology offered (2G, 3G, LTE, Wi-Fi, others), etc<br />&bull;	Rate plan analysis<br />&bull;	Device analysis</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 
Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) 2012-1 Camp Lejeune, North Carolina 

INTRODUCTION:

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the USMC Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) Team consisting of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Expeditionary Energy Office, Marine Corps Systems Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command and the Office of Naval Research will take a procurement action in this matter.  Neither the ExFOB Team nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

The USMC ExFOB Team is interested in gathering information to further its understanding of currently available technologies that could enhance the logistics sustainability of  remote Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) engaged in combat operations.
  Specific areas of interest for this RFI include: (1) Wearable Electric Power Conversion and Distribution Systems; and (2) Lightweight, Man-portable, Water Purification Systems for Individual/Fire Team/Platoon Level Internal Resupply.  Technologies of interest are those that would most rapidly and effectively enhance the self-sufficiency of forward deployed, individual Marines operating from a FOB or naval shipping.  Information is requested in the form of a brief technology description, working photographs of technology (no drawings), inclusion of any government reports, tests, demonstrations and/or any currently existing government contractual relationship.

GENERAL BACKGROUND:

Since March 2010, the Marine Corps has held an annual ExFOB event as a venue for industry to demonstrate their latest expeditionary energy capabilities.
  The primary focus at these demonstrations is to observe and evaluate industry solutions that will enhance the Marine Corps self-sufficiency, reduce the energy demand of platforms and systems, and lightening the load of the Marine Corps in current and future expeditionary operations.  Over the last two years the ExFOB Team has accelerated concepts-to-combat to reduce the Warfighter need for fuel, water and battery logistics.  ExFOB has guided the development of new requirements and has informed Marine Corps investment and acquisition decisions.

ExFOB 2012-1 will occur in the first half of the calendar year on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.  The intent for ExFOB 2012-1 is to seek solutions supporting the individual Marine/small unit power and water needs specifically focusing on solutions enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) at sea and when employed ashore.

Information received in response to this RFI is intended to serve two purposes: (1)  Technology descriptions will help formulate requirements development to increase the combat effectiveness of the Marine Corps; and (2) Technology descriptions may result in invitations for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their technologies at the ExFOB 2012-1 at no cost or risk to the Government,  if the manufacturer can prove their product or prototype would be sufficiently developed for a conceptual demonstration by 14 April 2012.
   This ExFOB demonstration will be conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Armys Enterprise Market Investigation Process (EMIP). (http://www.peocscss.army.mil/EMIP.html)

The ExFOB 2012-1 demonstration period will take place between 30 April and 04 May 2012 aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  A three day window on either side of the demonstration will be used for vendor setup and retrograde.  Vendors invited to demonstrate their technology will be referred to as participants and will be contacted via email with a signed letter of invitation NLT 1 Feb.  After this date the Marine Corps will actively engage all participants to determine operations/logistics, data collection plan and retrograde.
  The actual ExFOB 2012-1 data collection will take place over five days from 0800 to 1600.  Participants will be responsible for all containment measures and all water will be demonstrated in a closed loop system.  All measures will be taken by the Marine Corps to insure base safety, security and compliance are upheld throughout ExFOB 2012-1.  At NO TIME are goodie bags, gifts or alcohol allowed on the ExFOB premise.  Participants at the ExFOB can, and will, be asked to leave if they are found to be in violation of the above or acting in an unsafe manner at anytime. 


SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:

Wearable Electric Power Systems 
As the variety of energy consuming devices and batteries in the Marine Corps inventory continues to expand, power source compatibility is becoming a growing concern.
  The increasing requirement for individual Marines to embark on missions carrying redundant energy in the form of multiple incompatible battery types translates into excessive battery weight and a logistical burden on the individual and the force.  The use of wearable, weight-efficient centralized or de-centralized power systems is currently frustrated by the differing electric power requirements of, and interfaces to, hand-carried devices.  An additional complexity arises from the need to distribute electrical power to various hand-carried devices through electrical conductors and dirt resistant, mechanically robust electrical connectors.  Finally, the inability to efficiently harvest and store energy on individuals while both on the move and stationary for varying amounts of time limits the ability to reduce the battery combat load and to extend the power endurance of individuals.
  Information is requested on lightweight, man-wearable expeditionary solutions that form, or contribute to, a system of systems approach that may include one or more of several components: energy harvesting; efficient, high density, energy storage; electric power conversion and distribution; and, power demand reduction solutions for man-portable energy consuming devices.

Lightweight, Man-portable, Water Purification Systems for Individual/Fire Team/Platoon Level Internal Resupply 
The Marine Corps relies on filtration followed by reverse osmosis for purifying large quantities of bulk water from either fresh or salt-water sources.  Microbial sanitation of purified bulk water is maintained via chlorination.
  Water purification at the level of the individual Marine is handled differently.  Currently, the USMC utilizes the MIOX pen and MSR In-Line filter for individual level water purification.  Purification tablets are also included in the Individual First Aid Kit.  As technology has advanced since these items were initially fielded, the USMC is seeking the next generation water purification solution.  The system or technology should be scalable and lightweight using the P248 standards for fresh water.  The system or technology would allow for scalability from the individual to the platoon level.  In addition, simplicity and durability are critical features of a next generation solution.  Power sources should be limited, if possible.
  If affected by the freezing and thawing process, the potential issues should be addressed.    

SUBMISSION PROCESS AND DUE DATE:

Sources capable of fully satisfying these requirements should access the EMIP website below and submit a Technology Application Idea (TAI) submission form as per the directions on the EMIP website.   The ExFOB team is partnered with the Armys EMIP.  The due date for all submissions is midnight on 16 Dec 2011. Additional information regarding the joint Army/USMC review process and ExFOB 2012-1 industry demonstration shall be provided to those who submit TAIs at: http://www.peocscss.army.mil/EMIP.html


NOTE:  This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market capability of sources and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.
  No solicitation document exists at this time.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Information provided in response to this RFI may be shared with other Department of Defense activities.  Responses may not include Classified material.

This DRAFT RFP announcement is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement and should not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.
<p>The HAMS requirement is a non-personal service providing certified medical housekeepers, and janitorial custodians to implement the United States Air Force (USAF) HAMS services at USAF Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) throughout the Continental United States (CONUS). This program provides for aseptic cleaning, protection, and beautification of all rooms and areas identified for coverage at a particular installation to maintain a level of asepsis commensurate with the use of the facility, rooms, and areas. The three general requirements for aseptic management are: 1) aseptic cleaning, which is the removal of soil from surfaces; 2) protection, which is preventing damage to surfaces and equipment caused by normal use or improper cleaning procedures; and 3) beautification which is accomplished through aseptic cleaning and protection to provide a beneficial psychologically impression as it boosts patient, staff, and visitor morale.</p>
<p>The intention of this DRAFT RFP is to convey information to potential Offerors. This DRAFT RFP contains Section B; Section L and Section M evaluation criteria which includes a Sample Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) Individual Medical Facility Exhibit (IMFE) approach; and a Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>Additionally, provided in this notification as INFORMATIONAL DATA ONLY, potential Offerors will find data specific to number of deliveries, occupied bed days, authorized beds, and operating room cases. This data is not to be construed for use in developing a cost proposal, but only to identify potential cost drives for cost per square foot.</p>
<p>The 773rd Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (773 ESS/PK) is seeking questions comments, and concerns from interested parties. Please provide your input no later than (NLT) 2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST), 24 January 2012 to cynthia.lattimore@us.af.mil and sharon.bickford@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)<br />17 January 2012
<p><br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE- SOURCE FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source Flexseal Follow-on contract under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 (a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This authority will be supported by a sole source Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) which will be posted separately to FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>The Government has conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition strategy. A FedBizOpps posting of a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), Reference Number FA8818-11-R-0001, posted 16 December 2009, resulted in two responses. The industry responses have identified two potential contractors. However, additional research has shown that only one source is currently qualified for this type of work. As such, a sole source solicitation will be released upon approval of the Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) document for a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>This sole source follow-on contract will allow Aerojet GenCorp to continue to provide an end product and mission support for the Flexseal retrofit. The current contractual vehicle for these critical requirements expired 30 September 2011. This sole source action will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with an estimated contract value of $49M and an estimated award date on or before 31 May 2012.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the notice for the sole source Flexseal follow-on effort.</p>
<p>As stated previously, a sole source award is expected for the follow-on effort and the solicitation for this requirement is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2012. Notices regarding that acquisition will be posted to FedBizOpps.</p>

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) not a request for proposal (RFP). The US Army Product Director, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD PNT) is seeking sources to provide a family of PNT solutions for US Army and Joint Service applications.  The common component of these items is a SAASM-based GPS receiver.<br><br>This RFI identifies multiple capabilities and interested parties are invited to respond to any or all of the PNT devices described below, or any portion of the devices described below.  The target date for contract award varies by the item described based on complexity of concept. <br><br>1) PNT HUB PHASE I  <br>     A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial applications (host platform) with connectors for external power, antenna and electrical interfaces.  Specific aerial applications may also be considered.  PNT Hub Phase I is intended to mimic the functionality of an AN/PSN-13A Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and not require any changes to host platform software currently utilizing DAGR as an external source of PNT data.  The connectors and external data interfaces shall be of the standard design utilized by DAGR such that the PNT Hub can effectively substitute for DAGR in a DAGR mount and connect to DAGR accessory cables. <br><br>     PNT Hub Phase I shall route PNT data for external devices with a minimum threshold of up to 3; objective up to 4.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard DAGR Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase I is TBD.  This subset of technical documents is estimated to be 80% of the current full PRF and ICD.<br>Desired Product Availability - FY12.<br>   <br>2) PNT HUB PHASE II<br> A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial and potential aerial applications.  Connectors for external power, antenna and multiple electrical interfaces including Ethernet such that it can provide PNT capability on a host platform(s).  The PNT Hub Phase II would incorporate circuitry to prioritize and route PNT data with a minimum threshold of 6, objective greater than 6 external devices.  PNT capability enhancements are envisioned, to include, but not limited to:  precise timing devices (ie. chip scale atomic clock), inertial measurement units, external augmentation software, Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna/Anti-Jam antenna integration, etc.<br><br>     It is acknowledged that the PNT Hub Phase II may require modification of host platform software to accommodate the shared PNT source.  A technical document identifying the standard Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase II is TBD.  The technical documents for PNT Hub Phase II will maintain the basic PNT functionality.  A COTS wireless interface (WiFi/Bluetooth) is contemplated for output of PNT data to external devices.<br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>3) EMBEDDABLE GPS RECEIVER IN MINI-GROUND BASED RECEIVER APPLICATIONS MODULE (MINI-GB-GRAM)<br>  <br>     A chip-mounted SAASM-based GPS receiver that can be integrated/embedded to a host platform mother board or delivered (optionally) installed to a circuit card such that it can substitute for an SSI-GB-GRAM in the Type II SSI form factor.  GRAM is an open architecture specification that provides a non-proprietary definition of hardware and software for embeddable SAASM-based GPS receivers. The current production item is the Small Serial Interface (SSI) GB-GRAM.  The Mini-GB-GRAM would supplement not replace the current production item and is intended for application that cannot be supported by the SSI-GB-GRAM due to size constraints.  The nominal dimensions of Mini-GB-GRAM are not to exceed 1.5 x 1.5 inches.<br><br>     The delivery option provides the opportunity to order Mini-GB-GRAM in a form factor that can substitute for current production item but not be limited to current design or interface parameters.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard GB-GRAM Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to Mini-GB-GRAM is TBD.  This subset of technical documents are estimated to be 60% of the current full PRF and ICD.  The potential for a family of products to support terrestrial, aerial and precision guided munitions domains are envisioned.  Separate products to support separate domains are acceptable.  <br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>4) SAASM INTEGRATION TO COMMERCIAL SMARTPHONE<br>PD PNT seeks input on how best to integrate SAASM to commercial smartphones, e.g., a cradle containing SAASM that would physically connect to a smartphone or a separate device containing SAASM that would interface wirelessly to the smartphone. <br>Key factors: <br><br> 	Use of IS-GPS-153 (open architecture) data constructs<br> 	Full IS-GPS-153 compliant messages is a desired feature<br> 	Use of commercial open architecture wired or wireless interfaces<br>             ~USB <br>             ~Bluetooth or WiFi <br> 	Wireless interface must support encryption<br> 	Smartphone OS is Android open source<br> 	A Droid app to interface with & control  the SAASM module is desired  <br>Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation to Bid, Request for Quotation or Request for Proposal.  Additionally there is no obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)

Date:  	January 09, 2012					PR Number: R157412101109

1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):This purchase request is to obtain Medical Examination Services for Annual Asbestos physicals for Asbestos Workers in the Craft Shops located in Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park. These physicals consist of 1. Filling out an annual work sheet questionnaire, 2. A medical physical exam by a position for each employee, 3. Pulmonary Function test for each employee and a Chest X- ray (at the discretion of the Physician).  														2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):
___X__	Only one responsible source. ______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. 
Explain:  													There is a Medical Clinic Located at Mammoth Hot Springs within a few hundred yards of where all of these asbestos employees work.  All of the employees that need these Asbestos Physicals are duty stationed in Mammoth Hot Springs.  Each of these physicals takes approximately 1- hour to complete, so the Supervisor can make appointments for each of these 19 employees and these employees can basically work right up until the hour of their appointment. At the end of the appointment they can walk right back to work and continue with their work assignment; without any lost time for travel. 
Having these Physicals done anywhere else will require more time away from work and will have an additional cost for the government. Because having these physicals done anywhere else will require having to drive (more than 1- hour each way) in order to obtain these same services at any other medical facility.  Having these physicals done right here at the Mammoth Clinic allows the government and the clinic to stagger these physicals when it is the most convenient for us and does not reduce our work productivity.  IT allows us and the clinic to squeeze these appointments in of different days when we and the clinic are not bust or having to respond to an emergency. Another reason we are requiring that these services should be provided at the Mammoth Clinic is that if for some reason these appointments have to be changed or cannot be done at the appointed time, we don't have a bunch of employees standing around waiting on each other to finish their physicals. They can simply go right back to work and easily return to the clinic at the next opportunity.														 3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:We have had these physicals done at the Mammoth Clinic every year for more than 13 years.We reevaluate having then done at the Mammoth Clinic vs. elsewhere every year, but because of the additional time that the gov't would lose away from work and the additional costs for the transportation for all of these employees to another medical facility it is not feasible to look beyond Mammoth Hot Springs.			These services are available at the clinic located at Mammoth Hot Springs, all the employees are duty stationed at Mammoth Hot Springs, all of these employees can continue to work right up until it is time for their appointment and immediately after their appointment can go right back to work without any lost time driving more than 1-hour each way to obtain the same services that are available a few buildings away from where they work.															4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>The proposed sole source contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  The Government will consider all responses received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this notice of intent.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The period of performance will consist of a one-year base period to begin 1 July 2012 with two one-year option periods.

Syracuse University, S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications is considered the only vendor with the ability to provide the necessary training for Mass Communication Specialists to qualify for supervisory and special placement billets with Navy leadership.
  The advanced-level training is for selected personnel who have demonstrated unusual ability and potential for professional growth.  Course work includes both best commercial practices and special problems and situations unique to military operations.  Selection of another program would require a lengthy and costly adjustment period, during which time the effectiveness of the training would be compromised and the efficiency of the Navy would be reduced.  This program is considered uniquely comprehensive, current, and authoritative for the training of specially selected Navy personnel.  In addition to their special qualifications for Navy training, the S.I. Newhouse School has been fully accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC).

All responses may be emailed to Joe Haviland at joseph.haviland1@navy.mil and reference number N0018912Q0630.

<DESC>Title of Procurement: Using Bivalves as Biosentinels of Microbial Water Quality in the Mid-Atlantic Region
Procurement Number: PR-ORD-12-000213
Type of Notice: Special Notice-Notice of Intent to Sole Source 
Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park Procurement Operations Division, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Mail Code E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709
Response Date: February 1, 2012 at 4 p.m. Local Time 
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Microbiological and Chemical Exposure Assessment Research Division (MCEARD), intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, Inc. (PDE), for access to proprietary historical water quality data of the Delaware River watershed, and collecting ribbed mussels and Asian clams at specific locations in and around the Delaware Estuary.  It has been determined through market research that PDE is the only firm capable of satisfying the Government?s requirement with respect to conducting a research study on using indigenous filter feeding shellfish to monitor eco-systems health and microbial water quality within the US mid-Atlantic region.  PDE was identified as the sole source for this project due to their fixed monitoring stations within the Delaware Estuary,  exclusive access and proprietary historical water quality data on specific sampling sites of interest, proprietary historical data on ribbed mussel density and ecosystem health, and technical expertise that are critical to the success of the research project.
Technical summary: USEPA Region 3 and ORD established a regional methods initiative (RMI) research project to evaluate the potential use of indigenous ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and Asian clams Corbicula fluminae as biosentinels for ecosystems health and microbial water qualities in the Delaware River and surrounding regions.  Ribbed mussels were selected because they have been shown to be more efficient at capturing microorganisms, can filter more water than other indigenous bivalves in the watershed, and they are commonly found across most of the saltwater portions of the estuary. Similarly, Asian clams were selected because they are abundant in freshwater portions of the estuary and are becoming more widely used for water quality assessment.  The area of interest will be on a portion of the Delaware River that drains into a basin inhabited by nine million people.  Major urban areas within this watershed include Wilmington, DE, Philadelphia, PA, Trenton, NJ, and Camden, NJ.   This large  dense human population places the water of the river, its tributaries, and the estuary at considerable risk for animal and human sources microbial contamination.  
The research project requires collecting historical and current water quality data and carefully harvesting live indigenous Geukensia demissa and Corbicula fluminae from areas used for drinking water sources, recreational water sites, and commercial oyster shellfisheries that are impacted by human pollution.  These sites include but are not limited to: the Prime Hook Beach, Broadkill Beach, Holts Landing Beach, and Tower Road Bayside on the Indian River.  These sample and data collection efforts require careful and accurate identification of healthy ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and Asian clams Corbicula fluminae and proper handling, storage, and deployment of these animals to various test sites.   The contractor shall have the necessary training necessary to carry out these tasks and shall have the experience in identifying the appropriate shellfish species that are healthy, actively filtering, and suitable for transplanting into sites.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement by the response date indicated above.   Timely responses will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to David Murphy via the e-mail link below; telephone calls will not be accepted. 
The point of contact for this requirement is David Murphy, Contracting Officer, at Murphy.david@epa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source Contract using Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 Civil Works funds, contracting with other than full and open competition based on only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy USACE requirements for a subscription to NatureServe's Multi-Jurisdictional Dataset (MJD) Web Service. The service provides a quick and convenient way to find out where endangered, threatened, and other at-risk species are located in relation to USACE project locations. The proposed action will make this data available to USACE users across the country. NatureServe is a non-profit organization that represents an international network of biological inventories-known as natural heritage programs or conservation data centers-operating in all 50 U.S. states, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. The objective scientific information about species and ecosystems developed by NatureServe is used by all sectors of society-conservation groups, government agencies, corporations, academia, and the public-to make informed decisions about managing our natural resources. They collect and manage detailed local information on plants, animals, and ecosystems, and also develop information products, data management tools, and conservation services to help meet local, national, and global conservation needs. This subscription will allow unlimited usage/unlimited queries during the subscription year. These data are widely used by government, academia, NGOs, and the private sector to inform conservation and environmental management. A menu of XML and GIS-based web services is now available to streamline access to these data. NatureServe Web Services provides direct access to these data from desktops by integrating the existing distributed network of biodiversity databases held by state and provincial natural heritage programs. Data from most of the U.S. and Canada are accessible. <br>Access to the NatureServe's MJD Web Service will be provided to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Institute for Water Resources (IWR), 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315-3868. The subscription will be available to all within USACE that register to use the service. <br>The estimated total cost of this effort in the Base Year $ $86,347. It is estimated that the yearly cost will have a 3% annual escalation for Option Years 1-4. USACE will realize significant savings compared with obtaining the individual Natural Heritage program data for each state. In addition, we have an included an option to develop/test the subscription on a tablet computer for the governments use.<br><br>NatureServe offers unique access to all available biodiversity data. This subscription service is not provided by any other vendor. As such the data are generally considered the standard for biological evaluations are used by all sectors of society-conservation groups, government agencies, corporations, academia, and the public-to make informed decisions about managing our natural resources. IWR will be able to share the MJD Web Service with USACE districts, providing substantial cost savings to the Government compared with purchasing the data from each state's Natural Heritage database. It also ensures that the data is integrated uniformly. <br><br>NatureServe is the membership organization for a network of 82 independent natural heritage programs and conservation data centers throughout the Western Hemisphere. It was established in 1994 and was originally known as the Association for Biodiversity Information. By 2001, the organization had grown and evolved into its present form. The Nature Conservancy, which since the 1970s had provided scientific and technical support to the network, transferred this role to NatureServe, along with professional staff, databases, and responsibility for the scientific standards and procedures under which the network operates. It would be significantly more expensive than NatureServe's subscription to purchase each state's data separately. Since each state is a member of Nature Serve, these are the only two options to obtain the data. <br><br> NatureServe is presently the only vendor supplying this consolidated data and is used by all sectors of society-conservation groups, government agencies, corporations, academia, and the public-to make informed decisions about managing our natural resources. If other firms become available with similar biodiversity subscription services comparable to NatureServe, then those firms will be considered in future procurements. <br><br>An internet search was conducted to determine if any other vendors exist that have access to the required data. Only NatureServe was determined to be available to provide the desired data consolidated for all 50 states. Also, IWR continuously interacts with consulting firms that provide environmental consulting services, including several firms and subcontractors under an IDIQ contract. Such firms routinely visit IWR and provide information and presentations on their capabilities and expertise. IWR also tracks such firms through communications with other federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Department of Defense and through industry trade and technical publications. At present, none of these other firms can provide the required subscription services comparable to NatureServe's service.<br> <br><br><br>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

</a>
<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective November 10, 2010 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.  The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after July 6, 2011 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated June 6, 2011 (Refresh #17) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers submitted on prior versions received after July 6, 2011 will not be accepted.  

Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number  (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.  For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCI-L3-030084-B (include the dashes). The solicitation is entitled Schedule 084: Total Solutions for Law Enforcement, Security, Facilities Management, Fire, Rescue, Special Purpose Clothing, Marine Craft and Emergency/Disaster Response.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this request. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation parts 12 and 13.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is issuing this acquisition as a Request for Quote (RFQ) under solicitation number LDQ005984.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is. 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing This solicitation is set aside for 100% small business.
<p>Brand name or equal items will be accepted.  If an "equal" item is being proposed, then the product specifications must be included with the quote to demonstrate that the proposed item is equal, and must meet the Minimum Salient Technical Requirements.</p>

<p><br />TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS::<br />&bull;	The MALDI matrix sprayer must be able to spray matrix and solution rapid enough to not saturate the prints and spray with precise control in order to avoid delocalization of analyte.  <br />&bull;	Clogging has been reported as the major problem with matrix sprayers. In order to decrease this issue, the system must be easy to clean and have a heated nozzle to control the matrix from crystallizing in the transfer line. The nozzle should be able to be heated to at least 100 0C or hotter.<br />&bull;	Capable of nozzle flow below 100 microliters/minute.<br />&bull;	Sample plates must lay horizontal in the system while spraying.<br />&bull;	Must have a spot size of less than 100 microns.  The MALDI resolution is around 100 microns so a spot size greater will degrade the quality of the images.<br />&bull;	The unit should have a small footprint and fit in a hood for ventilation.</p>

The certificate shall state that preventive maintenance in accordance with the specifications of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has been performed and that the equipment is performing in accordance with the OEM's specifications such that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any one-time charges (including but not limited to repair or inspection charges) if such maintenance were assumed effective the day after the Contractor's performance ceases. The Contractor is responsible for bearing all costs associated with obtaining such certification at no separate charge to the Government. Should the Contractor fail to issue the required Certificate of Maintainability in accordance with this clause, or should any equipment fail to perform in accordance with the certification, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any reasonable costs incurred by the Government for the purpose of bringing the equipment up to the required OEM maintenance level. If equipment is acquired under this contract, without maintenance of such equipment being concurrently acquired under the contract, the Contractor shall issue a Certificate of Maintainability for such equipment at the time of delivery for each piece of equipment. The certificate shall state that the equipment is in such condition that the OEM (or the OEM's successor in interest) would commit that it would assume maintenance of the equipment without billing any charges to the Government. All charges required to obtain the requisite performance of the equipment, up to the later of the time the equipment is accepted by the Government or the warranty expires, shall be borne by the Contractor. The time the equipment is accepted by the Government is the date that the Government determines that the equipment has passed acceptance testing, not the effective date of acceptance. The fact that the equipment may have been acquired with a warranty does not relieve the Contractor of its obligations under this clause.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Selection and award of the resultant contract award will be based on a review of the offeror's technical approach (including subfactors), the offeror's relevant past performance, and the offeror's price. The Technical Approach subfactors are equal in weight. Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. When combined, they are more important than Price. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offerors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers to determine best value:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach - The Government will evaluate each offeror's Technical Proposal, including their sample syllabus/course agenda, sample course outlines, sample student critiques, sample student manuals and staffing plans (including r&eacute;sum&eacute;s) in order to determine their capacity to perform all the requirements outlined in the PWS.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance - Provide three (3) relevant past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The government reserves its right to obtain relevant past performance information of other sources.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price - The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness.</p>

The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>
<p>Adherence to Regulations and Notices. The Contractor shall ensure that its personnel adhere to the policies promulgated in USCG Regulations, Federal Regulations, Commandant Instructions and Notices.</p>
<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p><br />Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date. Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction for a two-day Electrical Safe Work Practices course (Code 501152) to a class size of 10 to 15 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA and TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this PWS if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the Electrical Safe Work Practices course is to train USCG personnel in safe work practices which meet OSHA's electrical safety standards and provide USCG personnel knowledge to safely perform work.</p>
<p>The Electrical Safe Work Practices course reviews electrical hazards in the home and on the job, electrical hazard recognition, OSHA and NFPA 70E lockout procedures, inspection test instruments, accident investigation, electrical risk assessment and the proper selection and use of personal protective equipment requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to provide students with the technical knowledge and skills to successfully perform Electrical Safe Work Practices during routine electrical work, equipment inspections and safety inspections by USCG military and civilian personnel.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.

Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Since 2002, frequent natural disasters and conflict have displaced populations and generated significant humanitarian needs throughout Afghanistan. Recurrent natural disasters in Afghanistan include drought, floods, landslides, earthquakes and avalanches which affect an average of 400,000 Afghans a year. The majority of individuals displaced under the Taliban regime returned home between 2001 and 2007, according to the U.N. However, natural disasters and continued conflict have resulted in recurrent and protracted displacement. An intensification of conflict, particularly in southern regions, forced more than 100,000 individuals to flee their homes in 2010, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. In addition, between 5.5 million and 6 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2002, according to the U.N. In total, approximately 400,000 individuals are known to be displaced as of April 2011, although restricted humanitarian access impedes comprehensive displacement tracking.</p>
<p>Since 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $260 million in humanitarian assistance to address the needs of returning populations, internally displaced persons, and other vulnerable populations affected by conflict and natural disasters in Afghanistan. USAID/OFDA-funded activities have included support for logistics and emergency relief commodities, responses to food insecurity, severe acute malnutrition, emergency health, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as assistance to recover basic livelihoods. USAID/OFDA continues to support a three-pronged approach to improving humanitarian responses in Afghanistan by supporting a rapid response capacity to address acute needs following natural disasters and conflict, assisting communities and local civil society to better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with natural disasters and enhancing humanitarian coordination and data collection and analysis so that disaster affected populations are identified and needs responded to quickly and appropriately.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Kabul, Afghanistan, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Kabul, Afghanistan, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires a willingness to travel within Afghanistan on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Afghanistan. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Afghanistan Mission, the Embassy's Refugee Coordinator, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations, and NATO-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Regional Office in Budapest, Hungary, the USAID Afghanistan Mission and, as required, U.S. Embassy staff.</p>
<p>The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Afghanistan and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs. This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), Provincial Regional Teams (PRTs), District Stabilization Teams (DSTs), as well as with relevant United Nations (U.N.) and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security and travel policies.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Principal Regional Advisor for Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA), the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Afghanistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, NATO-led coalition forces, OFDA/Washington, and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA's programs in Afghanistan. <br />&bull; Supervise relevant foreign national program staff within the Kabul OFDA Program Office.<br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Afghanistan. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/EMCA regional office, and OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate closely with OFDA/EMCA regional office, OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, DSTs, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and NATO Forces as well as U.N. agencies, International Organizations and NGOs working in Afghanistan.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Capacity and level of activity of local institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of U.N., IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.<br />&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and U.N. agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies, priorities and technical requirements. Work closely with OFDA/Washington Technical Assistance Group (TAG) and PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to the EMCA regional team on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with U.N., NGOs, IOs, GIRoA, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington EMCA regional offices and OFDA's military liaison officers at CENTCOM. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including official reporting cables as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Budapest, Hungary. However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Afghanistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for EMCA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>

<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p><br />Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date.

All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons.

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction for a two-day Electrical Safe Work Practices course (Code 501152) to a class size of 10 to 15 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA and TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this PWS if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the Electrical Safe Work Practices course is to train USCG personnel in safe work practices which meet OSHA's electrical safety standards and provide USCG personnel knowledge to safely perform work.</p>
<p>The Electrical Safe Work Practices course reviews electrical hazards in the home and on the job, electrical hazard recognition, OSHA and NFPA 70E lockout procedures, inspection test instruments, accident investigation, electrical risk assessment and the proper selection and use of personal protective equipment requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to provide students with the technical knowledge and skills to successfully perform Electrical Safe Work Practices during routine electrical work, equipment inspections and safety inspections by USCG military and civilian personnel.

<DESC>Release of the final OSP-3 Request for Proposal is expected by the end of February 2012. Proposals will be due 45 days after RFP release. Award is expected no earlier than September 2012.
<p>Due to changes in anticipated government launch requirements; there will be 2 lanes in the OSP-3 acquisition. Lane 1 encompasses 400lbm - 4,000 lbm to Low Earth Orbit or equivalent, including suborbital capabilities. Lane 2 encompasses 4,000lbm - 20,000+ lbm to Low Earth Orbit or equivalent. In Lane 1 only, successful offerors must provide capabilities to cover the entire lane. Teaming is acceptable to achieve this requirement. In Lane 2, offerors must be able to cover a significant portion of the lane. Comments regarding the appropriate requirement for coverage in Lane 2 are requested from industry at this time.</p>
<p>The OSP-3 CLIN structure has been collapsed into a single launch service CLIN. A mission failure clause will be added defining the financial penalty in the event of a launch failure. The government's intent is to strongly motivate against a contractor-caused failure but not render a contractor insolvent based solely on that failure. Comments regarding the appropriate penalty as a percentage of total price to accomplish this intent are requested from industry at this time.</p>
<p>The ordering period and corresponding fixed prices will cover a period of 5 years from date of award. There will be no option period and on-ramps may only occur in the event that no more than one offeror is on contract for that lane at the 3 year point.</p>
<p>The timeframe for execution of launch has been changed from 18-24 months after Task Order award to 24-30 months after award.</p>
<p>Bids received from contractors proposing the use of GFP will be adjusted for costs associated with aging surveillance, motor refurbishment, booster assembly and transportation.</p>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to the OSP-3 RFP must be based in accordance with customary progress payments. However, proposals for Performance-Based Payments will be considered after award.</p>
<p>The OSP-3 team will seek indemnification of offerors for 3rd party liability resulting from unusually hazardous activities after award. To assist in determining the level at which the Air Force will provide indemnification, industry is invited to comment on their current level of insurance against these risks and what amount is appropriate to require from all offerors.</p>
<p>The government will release a revised draft RFP as soon as practical and will invite industry comments.</p>
<p>Please submit comments to this update via email to anna.burkhalter@us.af.mil. Comments related to this update are due not later seven (7) calendar days from the date of posting.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will be hosting an unclassified Pre-Solicitation Conference (Industry Day) for interested vendors on February 8<sup>th</sup> 2012 from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (EST). The Industry Day is intended to inform industry of program requirements for the operation of the Cellular over the Horizon Enforcement Network (COTHEN), the competition timeline, and to provide a Question &amp; Answer opportunity<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span>CBP developed, purchased and deployed the "High Frequency" COTHEN communications radio network in order to meet CBP's tactical long-range radio communications requirements.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;This national/international network is comprised of land-based, fixed station transceiver systems, remote command and control systems, marine mobile systems, airborne mobile systems, transportable transceiver systems and many special purpose ancillary systems controlled by cellular switching technology. Each system that comprises COTHEN is specifically designed to support tactical law enforcement officers. The network is completely frequency adaptive and employs voice type 1-3 encryption. COTHEN is a primary means of long-range communications for many agencies and therefore it is critical that dedicated program management and conscientious users maintain network integrity. The network has been refreshed and modernized in the last two (2) years.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The center of the network is the Technical Service Center (TSC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TSC is manned 24/7 to support field users in their communication requirements, tactical, emergency or disaster response such as Hurricane Katrina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The COTHEN program has been operational for 26 years.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span>The program has grown to support the Department of Homeland Security and a host of other Federal agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently COTHEN supports Air and Marine platforms and field offices and continued growth is anticipated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><br />A complete description of program support requirements is delineated in the attached Statement of Work.&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Note: This announcement is not a "bidder's conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. CBP will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>INDUSTRY DAY Announcement:</p>
<p><br />The Naval Air Systems Command is sponsoring an unclassified Industry Day for an upcoming requirement for the US Navy's Laser Guided Training Round (LGTR) Program production requirement. The event will provide a general overview of PMA-201's LGTR requirements, a forum to ask questions, networking opportunities, and an opportunity to have a one-on-one session with the Government. The Industry Day will take place on the 31&nbsp;January 2012.</p>
<p>The Industry Day is intended to provide a venue for the Government and Industry to exchange information. Attendance at this Industry Day is limited to U.S. firms only due to security limitations as a result of Non-Foreign Space Availability. If industry partners have any questions or comments regarding this requirement, please submit specific questions to Ms. Peggy Belcher no later than 24 January 2012. Please indicate whether the question is either "General" - to be addressed during the Industry Day presentation or "Competition Sensitive" - to be discussed in a one-on-one session.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will begin at 08:00 and conclude before 12:00 on 31 January 2012 at DCS Corp Building 1 located at 46641 Corporate Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653. The complex will be open by 07:30 to accommodate registration verification. Following the Industry Day presentation, the Government will host one-on-one sessions with interested Prime Vendors, along with their anticipated subcontractor team, provided prior coordination with the Government is established. The one-on-one sessions give Prime Vendors a chance to ask specific questions regarding the program that they did not want to share during the presentation. These sessions will be limited to 30 minutes and will be held between 12:30 - 16:00 on 31 Jan. Session times will be randomly assigned and Prime Vendors will be notified of their time slot via email.</p>
<p>Industry Day Registration: Pre-Registration is REQUIRED. No general admission will be allowed. This is a no-fee event and seating is limited to three individuals for each company as there is limited seating.

<p>Hard copies of the presentation materials will not be provided at the Industry Day. However, the Industry Day presentation, resulting Questions and Answers, and a listing of the Companies who attended will be provided via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website following the event.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a contract, a request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The Navy will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A MODIFICATION NOTICE OF THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) POSTING FOR EXFOB  2012-1 CAMP LEJEUNE, NORTH CAROLINA.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION NOTICE IS TO AMEND THE RFI DUE DATE FOR A TAI SUBMISSION FROM 16 DECEMBER 2011 TO 20 JANUARY 2012.  VENDORS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED A TAI NEED NOT RE-SUBMIT.  

*********************************************************

INTRODUCTION:

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the USMC Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) Team consisting of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Expeditionary Energy Office, Marine Corps Systems Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command and the Office of Naval Research will take a procurement action in this matter.
  Neither the ExFOB Team nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

The USMC ExFOB Team is interested in gathering information to further its understanding of currently available technologies that could enhance the logistics sustainability of  remote Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) engaged in combat operations.  Specific areas of interest for this RFI include: (1) Wearable Electric Power Conversion and Distribution Systems; and (2) Lightweight, Man-portable, Water Purification Systems for Individual/Fire Team/Platoon Level Internal Resupply.  Technologies of interest are those that would most rapidly and effectively enhance the self-sufficiency of forward deployed, individual Marines operating from a FOB or naval shipping.
  Information is requested in the form of a brief technology description, working photographs of technology (no drawings), inclusion of any government reports, tests, demonstrations and/or any currently existing government contractual relationship.

GENERAL BACKGROUND:

Since March 2010, the Marine Corps has held an annual ExFOB event as a venue for industry to demonstrate their latest expeditionary energy capabilities.  The primary focus at these demonstrations is to observe and evaluate industry solutions that will enhance the Marine Corps self-sufficiency, reduce the energy demand of platforms and systems, and lightening the load of the Marine Corps in current and future expeditionary operations.
  Over the last two years the ExFOB Team has accelerated concepts-to-combat to reduce the Warfighter need for fuel, water and battery logistics.  ExFOB has guided the development of new requirements and has informed Marine Corps investment and acquisition decisions.

ExFOB 2012-1 will occur in the first half of the calendar year on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.  The intent for ExFOB 2012-1 is to seek solutions supporting the individual Marine/small unit power and water needs specifically focusing on solutions enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) at sea and when employed ashore.

Information received in response to this RFI is intended to serve two purposes: (1)  Technology descriptions will help formulate requirements development to increase the combat effectiveness of the Marine Corps; and (2) Technology descriptions may result in invitations for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their technologies at the ExFOB 2012-1 at no cost or risk to the Government,  if the manufacturer can prove their product or prototype would be sufficiently developed for a conceptual demonstration by 14 April 2012.
   This ExFOB demonstration will be conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Armys Enterprise Market Investigation Process (EMIP). (http://www.peocscss.army.mil/EMIP.html)

The ExFOB 2012-1 demonstration period will take place between 30 April and 04 May 2012 aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  A three day window on either side of the demonstration will be used for vendor setup and retrograde.  Vendors invited to demonstrate their technology will be referred to as participants and will be contacted via email with a signed letter of invitation NLT 1 Feb.  After this date the Marine Corps will actively engage all participants to determine operations/logistics, data collection plan and retrograde.
  The actual ExFOB 2012-1 data collection will take place over five days from 0800 to 1600.  Participants will be responsible for all containment measures and all water will be demonstrated in a closed loop system.  All measures will be taken by the Marine Corps to insure base safety, security and compliance are upheld throughout ExFOB 2012-1.  At NO TIME are goodie bags, gifts or alcohol allowed on the ExFOB premise.  Participants at the ExFOB can, and will, be asked to leave if they are found to be in violation of the above or acting in an unsafe manner at anytime. 


SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:

Wearable Electric Power Systems 
As the variety of energy consuming devices and batteries in the Marine Corps inventory continues to expand, power source compatibility is becoming a growing concern.
  The increasing requirement for individual Marines to embark on missions carrying redundant energy in the form of multiple incompatible battery types translates into excessive battery weight and a logistical burden on the individual and the force.  The use of wearable, weight-efficient centralized or de-centralized power systems is currently frustrated by the differing electric power requirements of, and interfaces to, hand-carried devices.  An additional complexity arises from the need to distribute electrical power to various hand-carried devices through electrical conductors and dirt resistant, mechanically robust electrical connectors.  Finally, the inability to efficiently harvest and store energy on individuals while both on the move and stationary for varying amounts of time limits the ability to reduce the battery combat load and to extend the power endurance of individuals.
  Information is requested on lightweight, man-wearable expeditionary solutions that form, or contribute to, a system of systems approach that may include one or more of several components: energy harvesting; efficient, high density, energy storage; electric power conversion and distribution; and, power demand reduction solutions for man-portable energy consuming devices.

Lightweight, Man-portable, Water Purification Systems for Individual/Fire Team/Platoon Level Internal Resupply 
The Marine Corps relies on filtration followed by reverse osmosis for purifying large quantities of bulk water from either fresh or salt-water sources.  Microbial sanitation of purified bulk water is maintained via chlorination.
  Water purification at the level of the individual Marine is handled differently.  Currently, the USMC utilizes the MIOX pen and MSR In-Line filter for individual level water purification.  Purification tablets are also included in the Individual First Aid Kit.  As technology has advanced since these items were initially fielded, the USMC is seeking the next generation water purification solution.  The system or technology should be scalable and lightweight using the P248 standards for fresh water.  The system or technology would allow for scalability from the individual to the platoon level.  In addition, simplicity and durability are critical features of a next generation solution.  Power sources should be limited, if possible.
  If affected by the freezing and thawing process, the potential issues should be addressed.    

SUBMISSION PROCESS AND DUE DATE:

Sources capable of fully satisfying these requirements should access the EMIP website below and submit a Technology Application Idea (TAI) submission form as per the directions on the EMIP website.   The ExFOB team is partnered with the Armys EMIP.  The due date for all submissions is midnight on 20 January 2012. Additional information regarding the joint Army/USMC review process and ExFOB 2012-1 industry demonstration shall be provided to those who submit TAIs at: http://www.peocscss.army.mil/EMIP.html


NOTE:  This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market capability of sources and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.
  No solicitation document exists at this time.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Information provided in response to this RFI may be shared with other Department of Defense activities.  Responses may not include Classified material.  Responses to this notice will not be returned.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  Information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time for publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) announcement.

<DESC>The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) has completed the first and second phases of the Kuali Financial System (KFS) implementation project which provides basic functionality as a Management Information System for finance. KFS is a community supported project that provides a comprehensive suite of financial software designed to meet the needs of all Carnegie Class institutions. Based on Indiana University's Financial Information System (FIS), it is the first of the Kuali projects and incorporates the baseline FIS functionality and approved enhancements, in what has become the Kuali mold: a collaborative approach to design, an open development platform, and a web-based operating environment.
NPS desires to expand and enhance the installed system over the next year with the increased functionality and customization requested by the users.
