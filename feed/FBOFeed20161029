<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to request A&E qualification information for the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Heart of Texas Health Care Network (VISN 17), AE Short Selection Database.
WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION DATABASE USED FOR?
The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 17 utilizes the Short Selection database to award Architect-Engineer (AE) contracts, below the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000.00), VISN 17 includes the following Health Care Systems:  Amarillo VA Health Care System (Amarillo, TX); El Paso VA Health Care System (El Paso, TX); West Texas VA Health Care System (Big Spring, TX); Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (Temple, TX), South Texas Veterans Health Care System (San Antonio, TX), VA North Texas Health Care System (Dallas, TX), VA Texas Valley Coastal Bend Health Care System (Harlingen, TX). 
VISN 17 includes the following VA Medical Centers:  Dallas VA Medical Center (Dallas, TX); Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Waco, TX); Kerrville VA Hospital (Kerrville, TX); Sam Rayburn Memorial Veterans Center (Bonham, TX); George H. O Brien, Jr. VA Medical Center (Big Spring, TX);  Thomas E. Creek VA Medical Center (Amarillo, TX);  VA Medical Center (El Paso, TX) and Corpus Christi Outpatient Clinic (Corpus Christi, TX) in addition The Austin Information Technology Center (Austin, TX) is included within VISN 17.
The database contains all of the qualified, interested AE firms that respond to this notice for consideration for future approved projects falling within the NAICS codes indicated. Examples of some of the types of work include, but is not limited to; low volume design, design of small warehouses and offices, design of building renovations, historic preservation, rehabs to improve energy efficiency and safety concerns, energy audits and studies, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, LEED consulting, design of HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, construction inspection, construction period services, asbestos investigations, mapping services, drafting services, surveying (construction and property), geotechnical investigation, and environmental investigations, reviews, inventories, and audits.
There are no known projects at this time.  We are establishing our pool of qualified, interested AE firms so that as projects are identified and funding is available we are positioned to utilize the short selection process to relatively quickly and efficiently obtain AE services.
WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?
The Short Selection Process utilizes the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-5.
For AE projects with an estimated total fee under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, (currently $150,000.00), The Selection Board shall review and evaluate architect-engineer firms in accordance with FAR 36.602-3 and VAAR 836.602-1, except that the selection report shall serve as the final selection list and shall be provided directly to the contracting officer. The report shall serve as an authorization for the contracting officer to commence negotiations in accordance with 36.606. A proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. A-E data files will be maintained by Geographic Location, Small Business Program and NAICS code. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.
Currently, as required by VAAR 819.7004, VA Contracting Order of Priority, the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisitions for AE procurements in all NAICS Codes herein, shall be set-aside for SDVOSB firms. 
Future Contracts will be for AE Services, including the following NAICS:
541310   Architectural Services
541320   Landscape Architectural Services
541330   Engineering Services
541340   Drafting Services

541360   Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services
541370   Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical)

541620   Environmental Consulting Services

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference.

<DESC>Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) activity.  

The United States Government, represented by the U.S Agency for International Development in Southern Africa (USAID/Southern Africa), intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an anticipated award of a contract for the implementation of the Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) activity.

Objectives: 
The overall objective for the contract is to provide program, administrative, financial management and acquisition and assistance support services to USAID’s Missions and offices in the Southern Africa region, including the Power Africa Coordinator’s Office.

The objective of the Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) contract is to provide services to USAID’s Missions and offices in the Southern African region, including the Power Africa office, in the areas of program support, administrative, financial management and acquisition and assistance services when needed to ensure USAID’s continuing ability to successfully implement its development assistance activities in the region.  It is envisioned that this will be accomplished through the following four tasks:

Task 1:		Program Support Services  

Task 2:  	Administrative Support Services

Task 3:  	Financial Management Services

Task 4: 	Acquisition and Assistance Services

A draft copy of the Statement of Work is attached for reference.  The finalized Statement of Work will be included as part of the RFP package, if/when an RFP is eventually published.  The anticipated period of performance for this activity is five (5) years from the date of award, subject to the availability of funds.  

This procurement is being conducted as a total small business set-aside in accordance with Part 19.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services).

The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.  Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package may be limited to this electronic medium.   

Issuance of this notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. 

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, which will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov and on the FedConnect web site at www.fedconnect.net. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<p>Architect Engineer and Construction Contracting Industry Day for Repair, Maintenance, Construction and Design Services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Europe District Projects for Israeli Ministry of Defense (MOD) Facilities in Israel.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Europe District, in conjunction with the Israeli MoD intend to be hold two (2) Industry Days to present the Israel Foreign Military Sales (FMS) - Construction Program. Presentations will be provided on future USACE Israel FMS construction Best Value contracts and the existing FY15 Israel Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).</p>
<p>The objective of the industry days is to provide information to interested United States construction contractors and architect engineer firms on the general scope of USACE design build and design bid build projects within Israel; typical infrastructure and facilities being procured; potential repair, maintenance and construction opportunities to support MoD facilities in Israel; as well as information on the solicitation and proposal process for best value and the FY15 Israel MATOC. All briefings will be presented in English with no translations.</p>
<p>Currently the Israel FMS Construction Program has $400,000,000 in on-going construction projects and $165,000,000 in Pre-award actions. The Program projects six (6) to ten (10) Best Value acquisitions ranging from $15M to $250M and approximately thirty (30) $1M to $15M additional task orders on the FY15 Israel MATOC over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC permits bringing on additional United States Contractor(s) under the On-Ramp procedures as planned for in the original Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solicitation W012GB-14-R-0030. Solicitation W912GB-17-R-0002 will be posted on FedBizOpps immediately after the completion of the Industry Days to solicit interested Contractors to submit Best Value proposals.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC is a $249.5M construction IDIQ with a base year ($49.9M) and four (4) option years ($49.9M each). Six (6) contracts were awarded on 18 Jun 2015. The contracts are currently in Option Year 1 with Option Year 2 to be exercised in Jun 2017. The number of current active contracts is five (5). The On-Ramp procedures as provided in the initial solicitation and contracts awarded are:</p>
<p>"The Government reserves the right to re-open competition at any time during the term of the contract. The KO intends to periodically review the need for additional Contractors during the contract period of performance (PoP). If it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to add Contractors, an on-ramp may be executed. When an on-ramp is used, the Government will advertise the reopening of the competition on FedBizOpps. All new awardees shall meet the criteria established in the initial solicitation. The evaluation and selection of awardees for any on-ramp will be the same as the evaluation and award criteria used for the initial basic contract awards. The anticipated number of awards will be announced in the reopening announcement posted to FedBizOpps; however the PCO has the discretion to award more or fewer contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending upon the quality of the offers received."</p>
<p>"Any Contractor that received a basic contract award shall not re-compete. The new awardee(s) will compete with any existing or remaining Contractors for all task orders. Any additions due to on-ramps will not impact the contract ceiling. The ordering period for new awardees will not extend the overall maximum term of the original contract, nor shall it re-establish the contract base period. The new awardee(s) will be eligible to compete for future task order requests for proposal issued against the basic IDIQ contract. The Government will not consider unsolicited request for additional Contractors."</p>
