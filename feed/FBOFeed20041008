<SUBJECT>R -- INDEXING OF BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE
<SOLNBR>05-101-KS
<RESPDATE>112304
<CONTACT>Kala Shankar, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 496-6546, Fax (301) 402-0642, Email shankak@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Mary Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email SMITHM@mail.nlm.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a need for indexing of approximately 550,000 biomedical and life sciences journal articles per year for citation in MEDLINE/PubMed. Indexing is to be performed over a one-year period (April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006), with options to extend for four additional one-year periods.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.

	   Most of the articles to be indexed are in English, with lesser amounts in German (approximately 8,000 articles annually), French (8,500 articles), Japanese (6,500 articles), Russian (6,500 articles), Spanish (6,000 articles), Italian (2,500 articles) and sixteen other foreign languages (each fewer than 1,000 articles annually). The articles to be indexed are in highly technical, scientific, biomedical and life sciences subject areas (e.g., anesthesiology, biochemistry, cardiology, genetics, hematology, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, neurology, pharmacology, radiology, etc.) and are from journals selected by NLM for citation in MEDLINE.

Indexing will be performed in accordance with established policies and procedures set forth in NLM’s Indexing Manual.  Indexers must analyze each journal article for subject content and apply appropriate subject headings drawn from NLM’s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). As part of the analysis and indexing of each journal article, gene indexing will be performed when appropriate. Gene indexing will consist of the creation of an annotated link between the citation for the journal article and the appropriate record for a gene or protein in the Entrez Gene database of NLM’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Approximately 55,000 gene indexing links will be created annually.

   Indexers who work on this project must complete the standard training regimen provided at NLM’s facilities in Bethesda, Maryland.  The training regimen, taught by a team of senior Index Section revisers, and scheduled by NLM, consists of formal two-weeks of Indexing Class and informal one-on-one training and feedback.  The total formal and informal training regimen requires trainees to work on site at NLM for at least six weeks, depending on the proficiency of the individual.  The minimum educational requirement for proposed trainees is a Bachelor’s degree with a major in the biomedical sciences, or its equivalent in work experience in a biomedical field.

Journals to be indexed will be assigned by NLM to individual indexers in batches containing approximately one week’s work capacity and based on the indexer’s language and subject capabilities.  NLM prefers that indexers work in the local Washington, DC metropolitan area and requires local work to be completed and returned within one week of assignment at NLM.  NLM will allow indexers to work outside the Washington, DC area, but the contractor must then bear all costs related to pick-up, delivery and return of journals between NLM and indexers, and journals must be completed and returned to NLM within fourteen days of pick-up.  Rapid processing of work is required to ensure the currency of citations in MEDLINE.  Average production from trainee indexers in past years has been 55 articles per week during the first six months; average weekly production from individual trainees during the first six months has ranged from 27 to 97 articles per week.

   Indexers will perform work online using NLM’s Web-based indexing system, the Data Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS).  Online work will be performed using Government equipment loaned by NLM for installation at individual work sites.  Equipment will consist of a specially-configured workstation and telecommunications setup.  

   Indexing is also sought for up to 6,000 chemical queries per year to be indexed by chemical specialists, and for up to 1,800 records per year of ongoing health services research projects for the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR). 

   Multiple awards are anticipated for this project.  Awards will be based primarily on the merits of the proposed indexing personnel, ranked by experience with NLM indexing, past performance with any form of indexing or work involving analysis of the biomedical literature, and subject and foreign language expertise.  All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The purpose of this initial market survey is to: 1. Provide industry with the Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s (FAA) projected voice switching requirements that will fulfill FAAâ€™s future vision for the National Airspace System (NAS).  These projected requirements are as described in the high-level NAS document, the NAS Architecture 4; and  2. To have industry describe how state-of-the-art voice switch technology that is available (or in development) from air traffic control (ATC) voice switch vendors that may meet these requirements.  For those requirements that are not met by voice switching products currently available, the FAA is interested in how easily the un-met requirements can be added and the time frame for such developmental activities. Advise whether the absent requirement is currently being developed through internal research and development (IR&D) or is the development anticipated through an FAA-funded contract.  FAA anticipates using the information contained in your responses to refine its future voice switch requirements.  FAA views this request as one of several additional market surveys.  Proprietary information/data may be submitted and will be handled according to FAA procedures. This public notice is not intended to guarantee procurement of requirements addressed in this market survey.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation, submittal of inquiries, or responses to this market survey and shall not reimburse any firm for any costs incurred in responding or preparing responses to this Market Survey. Responses to this Market Survey are to be submitted in accordance with the attached Request for Information instruction to: Federal Aviation Administration, ATTN: Larry Greer ATO-A, Room 403, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20591.   Questions on this market survey may be forwarded to Larry Greer, Contracting Officer: larry.greer@faa.gov or Tel: 202-493-4810.

Sponsorship is contributed in the form of monetary and/or in-kind contributions. As a return on your investment, your company may receive unprecedented recognition in the form of audio, and print media coverage. Sponsor exposure, with varying sponsorship levels, may include name/logo recognition, brochures, media coverage, feature articles, photo opportunities, posters, and will be prominently acknowledged throughout the event.  All offers will be considered. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept offers for sponsorships from any contractor, including their affiliates (division, business groups, subsidiaries, etc.) subcontract arrangements, teaming partners and joint venture partners who are currently participating in, or who intend to participate in, any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), or will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,000 or more.  If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the Government.  More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered.  Requests for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than December 10, 2004.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 05-01 High-Precision Long-Range Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD); CLOSING DATE:  07 OCT 2005; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  12:00 Noon, 24 November 2004; local Arlington, VA time.  POC:  Stephen Griggs, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA05-01@darpa.mil; Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/HPLD/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing to support the DARPA High-Precision Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD) program.

The objective of the HPLD program is to develop and demonstrate new target-in-the-loop active optics  approaches and novel high accuracy pointing methods. This new technology will be demonstrated in an affordable, small, laser-target-designator/locator package that will enable the user to observe, track, and designate a target at operationally significant ranges. DARPA anticipates that these new target-in-the-loop active optics  approaches and novel, high-accuracy pointing methods could enable a single operator to precisely determine, within a 1m spherical error, the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of a target up to 10 km away.

The active optics and associated processing of the device will be capable of controlling the spot size, and correcting/stabilizing the beam and image line-of-sight for atmospheric turbulence and platform jitter. These capabilities will vastly improve the performance of small handheld and UAV optical systems.

These new target-in-the-loop active optics approaches will be different than the current astronomic-based systems. There will be a long horizontal path at ground level with significant turbulence along the entire path.  The target has real extent, depth, and surface roughness, and there is no compliant beacon or guide star to aid atmospheric compensation. These features, coupled with the additional requirements that the system be small, power-efficient, and affordable, force a new set of solutions. These new optical components, control methodologies, and digital processing required to operate in this environment are at the core of this solicitation.

To focus the design effort, DARPA has selected a handheld laser target designator/locator system as the target application and demonstration vehicle for the HPLD technology.  This device will be used by ground combat elements that conduct terminal attack control (TAC) and call for fire (CFF).  Therefore, it should be designed to support their full range of operations and deployment methods, and be able to survive in a harsh environment for long periods of time with minimal maintenance. At a minimum, the device must be capable of day and night operation, target observation, designation and location at 10 km, and communication with other devices. Once the position is precisely determined, the operator should be able to observe, track, and laser-designate the target as required, using a single device. The system might consist of the device, tripod, and any other components necessary to achieve the required pointing accuracy calibration. Once calibrated in a location, the device should be able to operate without any outside aid other than GPS.  

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer’s Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA05-01) on or before 12:00 Noon, November 24, 2004, local Arlington, VA time.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations.   The HPLD program may be subject to U.S. Export Controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and National Security regulations. All performers must meet the requirements for participation set by those regulations.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Scientific and Technical Approach; (b) Military Benefit; (c) Operational Utility; (d) Management Approach; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (f) Cost Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities. 
A critical area of focus for DHS is the protection of the homeland from the release of a biological agent as demonstrated by the currently deployed BioWatch surveillance system. In FY04 HSARPA initiated two critical bio-sensor development initiatives under the Detection Systems for Biological and Chemical Countermeasures (DSBCC) Program, RA03-01. The Bioagent Autonomous Networked Detectors (BAND) and the Rapid Automated Biological Identification System (RABIS) initiated under RA03-01 will provide a cost effective, robust capability for continuous monitoring for a broad range of potential bio-aerosol threats with very high sensitivity and specificity. As a complement to the technology programs initiated under RA03-01, HSARPA is initiating the Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS) program which seeks to develop, test and transition the next generation of rapid bio-aerosol sensors for use in Detect-to-Protect system architectures. The IBADS program will develop optimized sensor systems characterized by the following metrics (see Appendix G for definitions): 
&#56256;&#56451;ƒnImproved Sensitivity (Level of Detection) 
&#56256;&#56451;ƒnLow Probability of False Positive (Pfp) 
&#56256;&#56451;ƒnHigh Probability of Detection (Pd) 
&#56256;&#56451;ƒnRapid Response Time 
&#56256;&#56451;ƒnLow Cost of Ownership 

The IBADS program will support research to determine trade-offs between the above metrics for selected sensor concepts with a particular emphasis on the relationship of performance to lifecycle cost, facilitating the evaluation of candidate Detect-to-Protect system architectures. 
The term ¡§bidders¡¨ is used generically to refer to respondents to this BAA. The BAA should not be construed as an Invitation for Bids within the meaning of Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 14.

<DESC>The Philadelphia Division of FISC Norfolk’s Contracts Department is seeking industry comment on a draft specification for the U.S. Joint Forces Command’s (USJFCOM) enterprise portal capability.  The portal capability is intended to provide the USJFCOM with a unified web presence and standardized knowledge management functionality.  The portal’s architecture is to be designed to minimize both cost and duplication of effort and capability across directorates within the USJFCOM.  The portal will streamline legacy applications and provide the standard environment for all future web development initiatives.  It is intended to fulfill this requirement through the procedures of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, resulting in the placement of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type of contract.  A draft copy of the JFCOM’s portal requirement is available at the following website:  www.neco.navy.mil.  The pertinent reference number is N00140-05-R-0116.  Industry is invited to review the draft specification and to provide comments that will enhance and streamline the resultant procurement.  In particular, the Government is interested in industry’s input in response to the following questions:  Does the draft specification provide sufficient detail to enable offerors to prepare competitive fixed price proposals?  If not, what additional information is required?  Is the draft specification restrictive of competition?  If so, how?  Any other input that industry believes would facilitate the procurement process and enable the achievement of the forestated goals for USJFCOM’s portal requirement is invited.  Responses to this request for comment may be directed to Guy.Goss@navy.mil.  It is requested that responses be submitted by no later than 22 October 2004 for the Government’s consideration.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

Prototype - Tool and Process Validation (Phase I): This task includes the demonstration of the B-FCAP Tool, a detailed examination of the required system interfaces with existing Navy CMMS and Facilities Management (FM) systems, and optimized SRM assessment, planning and execution business processes through utilization of a Contractor provided simulation software and test bed.  The Phase I validation will support the documentation and the Navy-wide implementation requirements (hardware, software and training) for Phases II and III.  This phase will be accomplished utilizing contractor personnel and equipment. Performance period is approximately 120 days, with estimated value of $500,000 - $1,000,000.

In this phase, the Contractor will provide the required equipment and train Navy installation personnel.  The Phase II Implementation will be held simultaneously at Norfolk, Virginia and at San Diego, California Navy installations identified in the Phase II Scope of Work.  Performance period is approximately 150 days, with estimated value of $4,000,000 - $5,000,000.

Full Implementation Roll-out (Phase III): This task includes a Navy-wide rollout of the B-FCAP tool, system interfaces procedures and SRM assessment, planning and execution business processes.  In this phase, the Contractor will provide the required equipment and training necessary to the Navy to accomplish full implementation.  The implementation schedule will be defined in Phases I and II.  Performance period is approximately 300 days, with estimated value of $1,500,000 - $2,500,000.

The selected firm must have on-line access to e-mail via the Internet.  The contract requires that the B-FCAP tool be a web application.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Dayton T. Brown, Inc, Bohemia, NY.  The government intends to procure the Control System and User Interface Replacement for the A/F27T-10 Hydraulic Component Test Stand (HCTS) under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, as Dayton T. Brown, Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and the only company with the expertise to accomplish the requirement in the necessary timeframe.  The A/F27T-10 Hydraulic Component Test Stand (HCTS) provides the hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic power, instrumentation and controls necessary for diagnostic testing and functional acceptance of repaired/overhauled aircraft hydraulic and pneumatic components.   The test stand’s current control system consists of a DAYTRONICS data acquisition system and an antiquated control system, which includes a DOS based computer interface to control the various output of the test stand.  The Navy’s intention is to remove and replace this control system with new state of the art hardware and software.  The new system should provide several advantages to the Navy including improved ease of the operator interface, improved reliability of the hardware and stability of the software.  Included as part of this replacement/upgrade will be the update of all logistic support requirements.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should reference N68335-05-R-0004.    No solicitations will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation NNG04082040Q on a sole source basis for Hybridized IR Detectors. The two best hybrids produced out of five will be delivered to fulfill this contract. The procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Rockwell Scientific Company under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.	The Government requires the detector vendor to provide the modified, completed detectors mounted in packages specifically designed for the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument.  The new detectors are intended to address an issue affecting the existing WFC3 near-IR flight detector. The flight detector was provided by Rockwell Scientific Company; hence they are the only company familiar with its design and performance requirements.	 Furthermore, the package which provides the electrical, mechanical and thermal interfaces to the WFC3 instrument was designed and fabricated by Rockwell.  Rockwell Scientific Company has a residual inventory of partially fabricated near-infrared detector arrays, developed for the WFC3 program, that are suitable for this investigation (individual die that have not yet been packaged, wafers that have been grown but not diced.  In order to investigate this phenomenon, the Government requires detectors of the same design as the current WFC3 flight detectors, with the substrates thinned or removed.  Thus, utilizing another vendor would cause delays in the delivery of the WFC3 instrument.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 23, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is publishing this Request for Information (RFI)and the draft Performance Work Statement(PWS)for cafeteria services serving in its Washington D.C. headquarters complex.  It is issued as a draft to seek comments and suggestions from experts in the food service industry that will assist us in meeting our ambitious goals for the solicitation that will follow.

The USDA headquarters is in a 4 building complex which houses approximately 6000 employees and is situated along the National Mall and near neighboring Smithsonian Institution museums.  Approximately 2000 additional employees are located in nearby leased office space.  As the department responsible for ensuring the safe, efficient and healthful use of the nation’s food and fiber resources, it wishes to provide its employees and many visitors with a food service that is pre-eminent among the federal agencies that offer food services in their facilities.  

The USDA headquarters complex has 3 primary food service venues:  the South Building’s main cafeteria and the Whitten Building’s café and dining room.  The successful offeror will receive a concession to operate these dining facilities and will be expected to provide customers with a variety of menu choices and dining experiences.  These will include a range of healthy eating alternatives, popular fare and some restaurant style selections at a variety of pricing points.  The intention is to meet the diverse economic and life style needs of the USDA employee and visitor population.

As a virtual small city within a multi-building complex, it is important to us that we offer both the serviced population and the concessionaires serving them with the flexibility to make the dining and business decisions that serve their respective and interdependent needs.  We recognize that employees have the choice to go elsewhere for meals or to bring in their own meals.  Our desire is to make it convenient, desirable and cost effective for employees to eat in our food service establishments, while letting market forces shape the creativity and decisions of our concessionaire.  We also hope to send a message to those using our facilities that USDA stands for quality, variety and healthfulness in food choices.

Finally, because we are a government entity and because we are offering the potential contractor a great business opportunity with an employee base that is in some ways a captive audience, we will oversee product pricing and offerings to ensure reasonableness and the ability of our physical infrastructure to support the ideas proposed by the concessionaire.  We look forward to receiving your comments and ideas for helping to make USDA the new standard of quality in employee food services.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Correct Version. Point of Use Consignment Concept Study Request for Information The Department of Veterans Affairs does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, market information, and capabilities for planning purposes.  To satisfy all requirements pertaining to and governed by regulations and policies, it is in the best interest of the Government to prevent and eliminate future problems.  It is also requested that a market research be conducted, finalized, and all conclusions documented prior to further advancements of this study.  This request for information is in accordance with the FAR Chapter 15, Subpart 15.201.  The Government believes all information provided from industry sources is important, and will be used for the possible implementation process.   Purpose: To determine if direct delivery of medical products to a Point of Use (Vending machine) by a medical supply distributor is feasible using the consignment arrangement.  The Contractor provides the Point of Use equipment (POU) at no charge and stocks it on a consignment basis, charging VA only for the products that are used.   Objective:  1. To have a Contractor provide POU equipment to designated facilities Cardiac Cath Labs. 2. Determine if equipment can accommodate necessary supplies for designated areas. 3. Contractor will provide and replenish all medical supplies on a consignment basis without medical center involvement. 4. The contractor will be required to provide service to the POU for approximately 6 months  5. Central Office will determine if the selected outside Contractor can meet and maintain storage and distribution standards in accordance with VA Directive/Handbook 7176 at the conclusion of the service provided.   6.

Goal: The Point of Use Consignment Concept Study will determine whether Point of use provide operational improvements, savings, reduction, and consumption in supply usage and the overall efficiency for Medical Center Supply Management.  This comparative study will also determine if POU systems currently located at a separate facility managed by in-house VA personnel using the traditional replenishment method has an impact on the performance of the medical center clinical staff, and medical supply technicians.  The test will conclude if in fact the medical facilities can apply the same distributor concept establish a method to reduce consumption, cost and be effective and prove the overall capability of the POU system is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received comments from both interested companies and the Government's Most Efficient Organization (MEO) team on the draft solicitation issued June 29, 2004.  Amendment no. 4,  issued today,  contains the questions/comments received and the Service's response.  After analyzing the comments and the workload data, the Service is modifying the solicitation and plans to release the final solicitation approximately October 29, 2004.  Because of the delay in issuing the final solicitation,  the due date for proposals and the Agency Tender will be extended to February 28, 2005. One of the major changes made to the solicitation is all workload data for the National Fish Hatcheries and Fish Technology Centers (FTC) where Animal Caretakers or Biological Science Technicians (BST) (or both) work have been placed into this solicitation.  Previously, the hatcheries and FTCs where BSTs work were in draft solicitation 982104R054.  As a result, the title of the solicitation is changed to Aquatic Species Husbandry. The revised solicitation, to be issued under 982105R053, will have approximately 25 more locations in the final solicitation than appeared in the draft.   The solicitation and amendments are available at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received comments from both interested companies and the Government's Most Efficient Organization (MEO) team on the draft solicitation issued July 16, 2004.  The questions/comments received and the Service's responses are contained in amendment no. 5 to this solicitation issued today and available at the website http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  After analyzing the comments and the workload data, the Service is modifying the solicitation significantly and extending the time period for the study. Following is an approximate schedule for the solicitation (1) Release final solicitation:  February 1, 2005 (2) Proposals and Agency Tender due:  June 1, 2005 (3) Award decision: September 1, 2005.  Significant revisions include: (1) Removal of workload from National Fish Hatcheries and Fish Technology Centers: All of the workload for the National Fish Hatcheries and Fish Technology Centers (FTC) where Animal Caretakers or Biological Science Technicians (BST) (or both) work has been moved from this solicitation to the Aquatic Species Husbandry solicitation, which is solicitation 982104R052. As a result, approximately 25 hatcheries and FTCs will not appear in the final solicitation.  (2) Addition and removal of sites: The Service may add sites that in FY 2003 hired Biological Science Technicians (BST) temporarily for seasonal projects. The Service also may exclude some sites. Because of our ongoing analysis, at this time the Service cannot provide the exact number of site locations that we will include in the competition.  A revised list of sites will be posted after it is finalized.  Amendment no. 5 contains other revisions.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a modification to Purchase Order 4C-S092-NBLX with Lotus Engineering.  The purpose of the modification is to provide EPA with 12 additional sets of repeatable emission tests on lawnmower engines.  The lawnmowers will have been aged in an in-use field aging program and therefore will be given to Lotus for testing with approximately 100 hours run time.  Three repeatable emission tests per set are to be completed before the engine hour meter reads 125 hours.  This data must be collected prior to December 1, 2004.  Given the need for continuity of data being collected currently being performed within the parameters and engine set up established in Purchase Order 4C-S092-NBLX and given the limited time in which this data is to be collected, EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lotus Engineering.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received not later than October 22, 2004 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), PM Light Tactical Vehicles (PM-LTV), Warren, Michigan, amends the HMMWV Repower Market Survey that was published in FedBizOps on 29 April 2004. The Government has revised the acquisition strategy for the HMMWV Repower Program.  In the first phase, the Government will conduct a limited source procurement and award up to three (3) contracts for five (5) each Repower kits, field service assistance fo r the installation of the kits at Red River Army Depot (RRAD), and field service test support at up to two Government test sites.  This will be followed by a second phase wherein the Government will down-select, from those contractors successfully completi ng phase one, a single award of a multiple year production contract for 700 each, HMMWV Repower Kits, in the base year, plus up to five (5) option years in quantities up to 3000 each option year.  Formal Best Value Source Selection procedures will be utili zed to conduct the down-select and the data gathered from performance and reliability testing under the phase one contracts at Government test sites will be used as part of the phase two formal source selection evaluation. It is not the Governments intention that contractors should develop a new engine, or a new major component, for this effort.  The engine and other major components selected for the Repower Kit must be currently available and fit into the Recapped HMMWV en gine compartment space.  The engine selected must be a current, EPA compliant production engine with contractor manufacturing capacity sufficient to support production for the Phase Two contract no later than 1QTR FY06.  The exterior dimension of the engin e should not exceed 34 inches in height and 35 inches in width.  The weight of the engine, as shipped from the engine manufacturer, must not exceed 900 pounds, excluding packaging.   If your firm wishes to be considered for Phase One of this effort, offerors must provide the following: 1)  CAD data in 2D format on the exterior dimensions of the dressed and undressed engine. 2)  Current production rate for your proposed engine. 3)  Your plan for how long the proposed engine will remain in production. 4)  The production rate of any other major components of your proposed Repower Kit. Also, if you have not already provided responses to the questions in the previously released market survey dated 29 April 2004, that information is also required by the date stated below.  The previous market survey can be found at:   http://contracting.ta com.army.mil/majorsys/hmmwvrepower/hmmwvrepower.htm. Please send your responses electronically to Mr. Chester Ray at rayc@tacom.army.mil by October 19, 2004.  You will be permitted to mark any document or information submitted as confidential.  Please mark your information with any proprietary markings you m ay feel appropriate. Any product literature than cannot be emailed may be sent to Mr. Ray at: 	Command 	U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command 	ATTN:  AMSTA-AQ-ATBA/MS 416 	6501 E. Eleven Mile Road 	Warren, MI 48397-5000 Your input is voluntary and no funding will be provided as compensation for your participation in this survey.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Sophia Hurt, Contract Specialist, Ph:(202) 273-5739, Fx:(202) 273-7448
<DESC>Point of Use Consignment Concept Study Request for Information The Department of Veterans Affairs does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, market information, and capabilities for planning purposes.  To satisfy all requirements pertaining to and governed by regulations and policies, it is in the best interest of the Government to prevent and eliminate future problems.  It is also requested that a market research be conducted, finalized, and all conclusions documented prior to further advancements of this study.  This request for information is in accordance with the FAR Chapter 15, Subpart 15.201.  The Government believes all information provided from industry sources is important, and will be used for the possible implementation process.   Purpose: To have a Contractor determine if direct delivery of medical products to a Point of Use (Vending machine) by a medical supply distributor is feasible using the consignment arrangement.  The distributor provides the Point of Use equipment (POU) at no charge and stocks it on a consignment basis, charging VA only for the products that are used.   Objective: 1. Confirm that vendor replenishment consignment method reduces supply consumption. 2. Determine if equipment can accommodate necessary supplies in designated areas. 3. Test contractor performance for complete replenishment without medical center involvement. 4. Conduct a study for approximately 6 months to determine if fees paid for this service is cost effective. 5. Determine if an outside distributor can meet and maintain storage and distribution standards in accordance with VA Directive/Handbook 7176.   6. Determine the usage of approved medical supply substitutes being stocked and replenished in designated area.   Goal: The Point of Use Consignment Concept Study will determine whether Point of use provide operational improvements, savings, reduction, and consumption in supply usage and the overall efficiency for Medical Center Supply Management.  This comparative study will also determine if POU systems currently located at a separate facility managed by in-house VA personnel using the traditional replenishment method has an impact on the performance of the medical center clinical staff, and medical supply technicians.  The test will conclude if in fact the medical facilities can apply the same distributor concept establish a method to reduce consumption, cost and be effective and prove the overall capability of the POU system is in the best interest of the Government. Please forward your information to Sophia Hurt (049A3) at sophia.hurt@mail.va.gov or Department of Veterans Affairs, Acquisition Operations Service (049A3), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20420.  All responses must be received by 12 noon on November 8, 2004.

<DESC>Point of Use Consignment Concept Study Request for Information The Department of Veterans Affairs does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, market information, and capabilities for planning purposes.  To satisfy all requirements pertaining to and governed by regulations and policies, it is in the best interest of the Government to prevent and eliminate future problems.  It is also requested that a market research be conducted, finalized, and all conclusions documented prior to further advancements of this study.  This request for information is in accordance with the FAR Chapter 15, Subpart 15.201.  The Government believes all information provided from industry sources is important, and will be used for the possible implementation process.   Purpose: To have a Contractor determine if direct delivery of medical products to a Point of Use (Vending machine) by a medical supply distributor is feasible using the consignment arrangement.  The distributor provides the Point of Use equipment (POU) at no charge and stocks it on a consignment basis, charging VA only for the products that are used.   Objective: 1. Confirm that vendor replenishment consignment method reduces supply consumption. 2. Determine if equipment can accommodate necessary supplies in designated areas. 3. Test contractor performance for complete replenishment without medical center involvement. 4. Conduct a study for approximately 6 months to determine if fees paid for this service is cost effective. 5. Determine if an outside distributor can meet and maintain storage and distribution standards in accordance with VA Directive/Handbook 7176.   6. Determine the usage of approved medical supply substitutes being stocked and replenished in designated area.   Goal: The Point of Use Consignment Concept Study will determine whether Point of use provide operational improvements, savings, reduction, and consumption in supply usage and the overall efficiency for Medical Center Supply Management.  This comparative study will also determine if POU systems currently located at a separate facility managed by in-house VA personnel using the traditional replenishment method has an impact on the performance of the medical center clinical staff, and medical supply technicians.  The test will conclude if in fact the medical facilities can apply the same distributor concept establish a method to reduce consumption, cost and be effective and prove the overall capability of the POU system is in the best interest of the Government. Please forward your information to Sophia Hurt (049A3) at sophia.hurt@mail.va.gov or Department of Veterans Affairs, Acquisition Operations Service (049A3), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20420.  All responses must be received by 12 noon on November 8, 2004.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  
THE HEADQUARTERS, AIR FORCE SERVICES AGENCY, CASH ADMINISTRATION/MANAGEMENT DIVISION (HQ AFSVA SVFB/C) IS SEEKING A COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP)-GRADE “INDUSTRY STANDARD” CORE TREASURY MANAGEMENT (IN-HOUSE BANKING) SOFTWARE/SYSTEM TECHNICAL SOLUTION THAT WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBLE USER-DEFINED BUSINESS RULES AND FEATURES FOR THE BALANCE AND DETAIL REPORTING, CASH CONCENTRATION, CHECK ISSUE/PAID (POSITIVE PAY) RECONCILIATION, BANK AND VIRTUAL ACCOUNT RECONCILIATION, BANK AND VIRTUAL ACCOUNT RECONCILIATION, OPERATIONS OF IN-HOUSE BANKING ACCOUNTS (I.E. VIRTUAL ACCOUNTS TO INCLUDE INTERESTS AND LOAN BEARING ACCOUNTS), CASH POSITIONING AND FORECASTING, TREASURY WORKSHEET MODELING, FIELD BANK ACCOUNT SWEEPS, NATIONAL AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION (NACHA FORMATTED ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER (EFT) INITIATION AND DOMESTIC/INTERNATIONAL WIRES), ADHOC REPORT WRITER, GENERAL LEDGER INTERFACE, GUI GENERIC IMPORT, ELECTRONIC MAIL CONNECTIVITY, VIRTUAL ACCOUNT FUND TRANSFER CAPABILITIES, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEAL AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT (I.E. TRANSACTION AND TRANSLATION GAIN/LOSS).  
BACKGROUND.  The Treasury Division of the Financial Management Directorate, through the Air Force Cash Management and Investment Program (CMIP), provides for central consolidation and management of all nonappropriated fund (NAF) cash resources.  The Treasury Division uses one principal concentration bank, and maintains accounts in other financial institutions on or near approximately 90 Air Force bases throughout the world.  Base accounts (i.e. virtual accounts) are with the CMIP (as the central in-house bank) and not with the financial institutions.  The base-level accounting system automatically submits the deposits, disbursements, and inter-NAFI transfers to HQ AFSVA/SVFB that are posted to the individual CMIP account holders.  The CMIP system uses inter-bank transfers to accomplish cash consolidations.  Automated Clearing House (ACH) remittances are also received at the concentration bank on behalf of the installations; these remittances are sent electronically to the Treasury Division and are posted to the individual CMIP accounts.  The Treasury Division establishes and manages all bank account relationships.  The Treasury Division supplies bases with all normal services provided by a bank.  Since the Treasury Division is actually the in-house bank for each base, there is no relationship between the local field bank and the base.  The Treasury Division owns the local field bank account and the base only uses it as a depository.  The concentration account relationships are only with the Treasury Division.  In this capacity, the concentration account sends and receives ACH transactions, pays checks issued against the account, concentrates funds from local field banks, and reports all information concerning these and other transactions to the Treasury Division.  A base may use more than one commercial bank account (e.g. U.S. dollar and foreign exchange) with the Treasury Division and will report all transaction information for each account in the same file.  There are outside agencies that make remittances to the Treasury Division such as Army Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) and Treasury Offset Program.  These remittances are then distributed to CMIP account holders.  These fundamental relationships compose the Air Force cash management process.  
OPERATING SYSTEM.  The system must run using the Windows 2000 Server Operating System.  No others will be accepted.  The AFSVA Operating Environment is a Windows 2K platform, which includes applications and software such as Internet Information Server (IIS) 5.0, SQL Server and Windows Server (Win 2K Server and NT 4.0 Server).

All responses should be received no later than 19 November 2004, 4:30PM, Central Daylight Time.  
OTHER.  The information received will be considered confidential and will not be disclosed without the express written consent of the supplier.  Any information provided will be at no cost to the Government.  This is a nonappropriated fund entity and it does not appropriate funds of the United States Government.  Nonappropriated funds are generated by the military community through the sale of goods and services and the collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs.  Federal tax dollars are not involved.

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought for a Personal Identification Credential System (PICS).  PICS is a Government effort to produce a system that will allow rapid and secure entry control to Government installations through the use of an identification device activated by a biometric signature.  The Government is looking for a close to credit card-size device, including a fingerprint sensor, to be issued to each user.  Fingerprints are to be used for the biometric identification due to the high maturity of the technology.  Notional components of a PICS system include (but are not limited to) the hand-held personal devices issued to users, a reader to interface the hand-held at the entry point to a local database, an enrollment station to register the hand-held to the individual user, and any supporting hardware and software needed to integrate the system into an entry point to Hanscom AFB, MA.  The following are the basic requirements that the Government expects of the PICS.  1.  PICS should provide positive identification and verification of all registered users.  2.  It should be able to be operated from inside a vehicle with the windows closed.  3. The verification process time should at least support the current throughput of 6 vehicles per minute.  4.  PICS should operate in all weather conditions.  5.  The size and weight of the PICS hand-held unit should allow it to be stored in a standard shirt or pants pocket.  A size close to that of a credit card is desired.  The following is the envisioned operational concept for the PICS.  The PICS enrollment station will be used to encode the fingerprints of the individual onto the PICS hand-held unit.  Once enrolled, the user will then utilize the PICS hand-held unit to authenticate their identity against a central database of authorized personnel at entry points where the PICS reader is installed.  It is the intent of the Government to conduct a full and open competition for a development effort to produce PICS for the lowest possible production cost for the system.  The production cost of the PICS hand-held unit should not exceed $50 per unit threshold ($40 objective) for an annual production increment of 100,000 units. Specifically for this effort, the Government is looking for a minimum of 200 pre-production prototype hand-held PICS units, two PICS readers and two PICS enrollment stations.  The contractor will install and support a three-month throughput test of the PICS at Hanscom AFB, MA. Units proposed should be of a design ready for immediate mass production.  Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  The PICS Request For Proposal (RFP) is tentatively scheduled to be released within 60 days of this notice.  Offerors will be provided 30 days to respond to the RFP upon issuance.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted.  RFP requests will be accepted through the Contract Specialist via e-mail only. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Interested Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System (CCR). Interested contractors should ensure any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest have been, or are in the process of being, mitigated to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  This Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>1.0 Scope: This document is the Statement of Work (SOW) for request for information of current technology for a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) anti-virus product(s) to support the House of Representatives enterprise requirements. 2. 0 Objective: This RFI will provide the U.S. House of Representatives with commercial enterprise-wide anti-virus software, maintenance and services for the implementation of the latest generation comprehensive, enterprise-wide anti-virus protection solution for all House servers, desktops and laptops. House Mail servers are excluded from this RFI. 2.0 Background: The House IT infrastructure consists of a single LAN system throughout the Capitol and Congressional buildings located in Washington DC. The computer systems of all Members of Congress, Leadership, Committees, and other House support organizations are connected to each other through this LAN system. A private Frame Relay network (WAN), predominantly 512K with some 256K and 56K connectivity, connects approximately 940 Member of Congress District Offices throughout the continental United States and its territories. Additionally, some remote offices connect via IPSEC hardware VPN over commercial ISP services. Within this network are 1000-1500 servers, predominantly Windows NT with a smaller mix of Novell NetWare, AIX, and Unix operating systems (some running SAMBA). As many as 500 Windows NT/2000 servers act as primary domain controllers and approximately 200 Windows NT/2000 servers act as secondary domain controllers. Our client installations consist of over 14,000 workstations running various Microsoft Windows operating systems (98, NT, 2000 and XP) with Windows 2000 being the predominant desktop operating system, and a small number of Macintosh systems. These workstations are all physically connected to the LAN/WAN and over 1,000 users connect remotely to the LAN/WAN through secured dial access and IPSEC VPN tunnels. The House infrastructure will also be implementing an infrastructure wide Active Directory Service over the next year. The House is currently in the process of implementing an Alternate Computing Facility, which will serve as a disaster recovery site for their computing infrastructure in the event of a catastrophe. It is highly desirable to employ an antivirus product which will easily lend itself to providing a method for insuring uninterrupted protection for all House systems in the event of such a disaster. 3.0 Technical Overview: HIR intends to use 8 Windows 2000 servers as the internal staging point for all desktop and in-office servers (i.e. servers not employed in an enterprise-wide infrastructure support role). The term client will be used to refer to systems that install and update antivirus software under this approach. Each staging server incorporates the following specifications: • CPU: 2 900MHz processors • Memory: 1GB MB RAM • Network Interface: 2 Dual Port Compaq Network Interface cards utilizing all ports in Compaq load balancing mode. • Disk space (total): 3 18GB drives per server running RAID Level 5 N+1 Arrays • Operating System: Windows 2000 Advanced Server, SP4 The default configuration is to have clients install and update the anti-virus software directly from our Antivirus server farm. We anticipate approximately 8,000 clients will use the default configuration. We are also open to deploying from a web server. Some offices may desire to stage the anti-virus software for installation and update on their own in-office file server. We anticipate approximately 100 offices may select this option. This flexibility should be supported. The administrator for the offices that do this secondary staging should be able to monitor the status of the clients that update from the secondary staging server. The enterprise administrator should be able to monitor the status of all clients, including those that update from a secondary server. A desired feature is for administrators of offices that update from the enterprise Antivirus server farm to be able to monitor the status and modify configuration of the clients for that office, but not of other offices. Granularity of access control to configuration/status information is also desired (allow access to view status information to some people, but prohibit them from changing configurations.) Security controls for deploying and updating anti-virus software and for status reporting and monitoring should be identified. Of particular interest is whether NT security or an internal security mechanism within the anti-virus software distribution agent is used. Also of interest is whether share level access to the NT file system is required or if process-to-process communications (remote procedure calls – RPC) is utilized. 4.0 Enterprise Anti-Virus Mandatory Required Items: 1 Server and Workstation/Client Support 2 ICSA certification of anti-virus software for all clients. For the purposes of this quotation, Windows 98, Windows NT Workstation, Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, And Windows XP are considered separate clients. If software for a particular client is not ICSA Certified the responding vendor should explain why the product failed certification or why the product was not submitted to ICSA for certification. Certification status for Macintosh support should also be included. 3 A mechanism for returning a not fully operational client to a fully operational condition (back out or roll back) in the event of a bad installation or update. 4 Real-time outbreak detection and prevention 5 Reliable detection and performance 6 Immediate notification of infection 7 Automatic updates and installs from network servers or web servers within the House infrastructure 8 Assured enforcement that software is running, remains installed, and is current 9 Centralized Management of enterprise anti-virus program 10 Centralized single database for enterprise anti-virus Program 11 Centralized Granular Reporting and Roles Based Administration 12 No user intervention for operation or updates 13 Ability to support remote users 14 Ability for workstations to update without Administrative privileges 15 Ability for remote installation through frame relay 16 Ability to perform an automatic scan of the hard drive for viruses and to check the memory at the frequency level required by the House’s perceived risk level 17 Ability to protect the boot record and inform the user when a virus is detected 18 Ability to protect incoming data from a modem or network connection and intercept a virus before it is stored on the hard drive 19 Ability to scan all files that are opened, created, or downloaded 20 Ability to scan all file types for malicious code and monitor JavaScript and ActiveX components for malicious activity 21 Ability to provide an option to choose scanning preferences and perform on-demand scans 22 Minimum network bandwidth utilization when Applying product updates.

<DESC>Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners for the New Millennium Program Space Technology - 9 for NASA Research Announcement (NNH04ZSS002N).	 Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, “New Millennium Program (NMP) Space Technology-9 (ST9)” (http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/NNH04ZSS002N/index.html) on August 25, 2004. The goal of NMP is to validate, through flight in space, breakthrough technologies that show distinct promise of being able to minimize risk of first use and reduce cost for future space science and exploration missions.	This NRA solicits proposals for advanced technologies to be incorporated into a system-level flight validation experiment in the 2007-2008 timeframe.  NMP defines a system-level technology validation mission as one in which a single spacecraft is dedicated to the in-space validation of a system-level technology advance and incorporates those component and subsystem technology advances necessary for the success of the new system.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, non-profit institutions, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the NMP NRA to develop proposals and (if selected, develop) products designed to address technology advances in Descent and Terminal Guidance System Technology for Pinpoint Landing and Hazard Avoidance.  For additional details refer to Appendix D of the NRA entitled, “Terrain-Guided Automatic Landing System for Spacecraft (TGALS).” This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide proposal and product development support consistent with the efforts synopsized for the LaRC proposal outlined below. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development.  Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control This criteria evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.   (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Rosemary R. Baize, Mail Stop 469 Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB October 22, 2004. Procurement questions should be directed to Brad Gardner, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-2525, Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- Pumpkin Launch Contest Sponsorship Opportunity at Robins AFB
<DESC>On November 5, 2004 the Robins Air Force Base 78th Services Division Smith Community Center is hosting its Pumpkin Launch Contest.  All Robins AFB employees, dependents, retirees and their families are encouraged to bring out their pumpkins to the Skeet Range and launch them in the air.  There will be two categories in which you can enter for the event, the catapult category and the launch category.  For the catapult category contestants will build their own catapults.  These catapults are to be mechanical, not combustible.  They will be brought out to the Skeet Range and judged on appearance and then tested for firing accuracy.  First place will be awarded for the best looking catapult and for the one with that fires best for distance.  We will also have a Pumpkin Bungee Launch set up where customers may brig out their old Halloween pumpkins and fire for distance.  This will be $1 per shot and the pumpkins must weigh 5 lbs or less.  The contestant with the greatest distance will be presented with the Pumpkin Bungee Launch trophy.  We would like to partner with companies who are interested in providing cash and/or in-kind for the trophies we wish to give away to our winners.
Would your company like to be a part of the Pumpkin Launch Contest at Robins AFB this year?

<SUBJECT>R--Hydraulic Model Testing to assist with the redesign of the American River Pump Station, Phase II.
<DESC>United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1.  The government intends to negotiate and award to Colorado State University for Hydraulic Model Testing to assist with the redesign of the American River Pump Station, Phase II.  The work shall consist of the following: Utilize an EXISTING 1 to 12 scale River model to redesign the river inlet system.  The model represents approximately 1000 feet of river channel with a width of approximately 300 feet.  This model has the ability to introduce flows of 0.6 cfs to 40 cfs which represent real world flows of 300 cfs to greater than 16,000 cfs.  The river inlet system will consist of a primary river inlet located on the bottom of the river channel, a Maintenance Gate located upstream of the primary inlet, an emergency inlet collocated with the Maintenance Gate, and a bypass channel located adjacent to the main river channel.  This river model work required by this contract will minimize negative river hydraulic affects on the withdrawal performance of the primary intake over a wide range of river flows and optimize the geometry and location of these components to improve the withdrawal capabilities of the primary intakes.  This model work will be performed through an iterative approach. Utilize an EXISTING 1 to 1 scale screen model to redesign the primary intakes system.  The model currently represents a 24-inch wide section through the primary intake.  The test flume containing this model has an 8-foot long head box, a 5-foot loon approach section, a 20 foot long test section, 5 foot long lip block or transition section, and a 20 foot long tailwater section.  The test section is subdivided into 3 chambers.  Each chamber in the test section is sealed, separating them from each other, such that each chamber can be measured and controlled individually. The center chamber is fitted with an air backwash system to test the screen cleaning performance characteristics of this system.  The air backwash system is capable of delivering 150 psi air bursts over a prolonged period of time.  The flume is capable of producing slopes from 0 to 10 percent.  The model can produce flows up to 60 cfs.  Stainless steel wedge wire screens from two manufacturers have been tested in this model to determine screen performance characteristics and inlet performance characteristics.  The tested screens were provided with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm openings.  The wedge wire for these screens has been tilted at a 5-degree slant from the vertical to assist the withdrawal performance.  The screen model work required by this contract will be coordinated with the river model efforts to further confirm screen and intake performance characteristics and possible test other operating conditions that may be required.   This model work will be performed through an iterative approach. All model work will be summarized in a final report.  All physical models will be retained on site for a period of 6 months after receipt of the final report. This notice will be the only official notice prior to award of the contract.  The use of Colorado State University in a sole source contract is a logical follow on and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Intended award date is November 1, 2004.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any questions regarding this effort should be directed to the technical representative, Mr. Alan Stroppini at astroppini@mp.usbr.gov, and the contracting officer, Ms. Debra Keith at dkeith@mp.usbr.gov.  All inquiries shall be received by October 22, 2004.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers Day Announcement - TANGO BRAVO
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) announces the joint DARPA/United States Navy Tango Bravo Program. DARPA will host a Tango Bravo Program Proposers’ Day Conference on November 8, 2004 at The Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Ste 600, Arlington, Virginia beginning at 8:30 am and anticipated to end at 4:30 pm. The Proposers’ Day Conference will be classified at the Secret level and open to those cleared for such purpose. The purpose of the conference is to provide information on the Tango Bravo Program, promote discussion on this topic, and address questions from potential proposers.  

It is anticipated that a Tango Bravo Program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be published prior to the conference.  DARPA and the US Navy together plan to initiate a technology demonstration program to enable design options for reduced-size affordable submarines with full nominal capability, while simultaneously decreasing platform infrastructure and the cost of future design and production. The intent of the Tango Bravo Program is to overcome selected technological barriers that are judged to have a significant impact on submarine platform infrastructure and cost.  Five technical areas will be solicited under a Broad Agency Announcement anticipated to be published in the forthcoming weeks: (1) shaftless propulsion, (2) external weapons stow and launch, (3) hull adaptable sonar array, (4) radical ship infrastructure reduction, and (5) reduced crew/automated attack center.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Announcement - B-FAB
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) anticipates releasing a solicitation during early December 2004 for the B-FAB program.  Recent developments in re-engineered bio-chemical synthesis and assembly processes offer a process path for fabricating nanoscale in-organic meta-structures with potential for high-efficiency, advanced photovoltaic solar power sources.  The objective of the B-FAB program is to demonstrate high-efficiency photovoltaics with a minimum of 50% efficiency, and a target of 75% efficiency.  Final deliverables will include a minimum of 1,000 devices, each producing at least 1W, with the above minimum efficiency assuming a standard solar fluence of 1 kW/m2.  The B-FAB program is not limited to the use of bio-enabled fabrication methods, but alternative fabrication methods must be cost effective in achieving device and performance objectives.  

It is anticipated that the successful development and fabrication of metastructured, nano-scale high-efficiency photovoltaic cells will require multiple disciplines, and/or multiple organizations functioning as a single team.  Comprehensive proposals must address the necessary elements of research and development, transition of research and development, and initial productization.  The program requires that teams be formed to sufficiently address all aspects of the problem and ultimately develop high-efficiency photovoltaic cells as a product that is scaleable to industrial fabrication of the device.  Potential teams may be comprised of elements from industry, academia, and national laboratories, but must include elements from industry appropriate to the subsequent manufacture of successfully developed devices.  

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will hold a Proposers Day Conference and Teaming Meeting in support of the B-FAB program on 16 November 2004 at the Washington Dulles Airport Marriott, 45020 Aviation Drive Dulles, VA beginning at 8:00am with an anticipated ending time of 5:00pm.  The registration fee for the conference will be $95.00.  The purpose of the conference and teaming meeting is to provide program information, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  A portion of the conference agenda will be reserved for a poster session by prospective proposers who wish to present company overviews and discuss their B-FAB relevant technology expertise.  In order to display a poster the proposer must submit a white paper for approval, describing their poster and relevant expertise to the B-FAB program.  The white papers must be no longer than three (3) pages, demonstrate the relevance of the technology to the B-FAB program, discuss process capabilities, design, or fabrication capabilities, and present ideas that will be amenable to team development.  Selected white papers will be notified to submit a poster for Proposers Day.  The white papers must be submitted no later than 29 October 2004.  The white papers can be submitted by e-mail to B-FAB@darpa.mil .  The selected white papers will then be required to submit electronic copies of the posters they will be presenting.  All posters must be received by 5 November 2004 for prior review by DARPA.  All material will be subjected to review by DARPA for sensitive and controlled unclassified information.  It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all material presented is approved for public release by the organization that funded the research.  

Registration for the Proposers Day Conference is on-line at http://safe.sysplan.com/b-fab.  In order to submit an approved poster you must be registered.  If on-line registration is not possible, please contact the program e-mail at B-FAB@darpa.mil no later than 12 November 2004 to register.  The attendance at the meeting will be restricted to the first 200 people to register.  Foreign nationals will be required to complete and return the DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) no later than 12 November 2004 if they wish to attend the conference.

Attendance at the Proposers Day Conference is not required to propose to any BAA that may be associated with this technology area.  Updates to program information will be posted as necessary to http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/BFAB/index.htm.
