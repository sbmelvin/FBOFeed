<DESC>TITLE: Upgrade/modification or replacement of the Radio Frequency (RF) Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Suite on the B-52H, AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H platforms   DESCRIPTION: The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) 647th Combat Electronics Squadron is conducting market research analyses in support of examining technology levels and potential system availability to upgrade/modify or replace the RF ECM self-protection suites on the B-52H and the AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H aircraft. ASC is issuing this CRFI to gather information in conjunction with on-going Air Force Electronic Warfare Capabilities Investment Strategy (AFEWCIS) activities in support of the AF EW Life Cycle Management Group (LCMG).  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This CRFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This CRFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, ASC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not p! ay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this CRFI.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  All costs associated with responding to this CRFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.  Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this CRFI in order to assist ASC in determining potential levels of technology/systems available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. Only responses from US companies will be accepted.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional inform! ation pertaining to this CRFI.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.
PROPRIETARY MATERIALS PROTECTION: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore acquisition options and strategies for the possible approaches within the military.  All information received in response to this CRFI that is properly marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly.  Proprietary information must be clearly marked on the outside container and on the materials inside.  The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages, for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Any materials submitted in accordance with this CRFI which contain information that is marked as proprietary will be protected as proprietary information.  Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as support contractor personnel hir! ed to provide technical assistance in assessing the responses, consulting on potential operational requirements refinement, and assisting the Government in the preparation of any resulting acquisition strategy.  All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905.  All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.  The Government has also determined that the contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.
Responders may provide a response to an upgrade option, a system modification, a new ECM suite, or any combination of these solutions.  However, if multiple solutions are presented each distinct solution should be fully documented as a complete response. The intent of this CRFI is to assist Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) with information needed to establish/refine operational requirements and set priorities for possible upgrades, modification or replacement of RF ECM systems on the B-52H and AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H. The goal is to identify new and existing technology investments that can that can provide the B-52H and AC/MC-130 the survivability assets essential to effective execution of their assigned missions. This CRFI includes all aspects of RF EW self-protection across all phases of combat. 
APPROACH: ASC 647th AESS (Combat Electronics Squadron) is requesting information on viable options that will upgrade/modify or replace the current B-52H and AC/MC-130 aircraft RF ECM self-protection suites, which include the ALQ-172, ALQ-155, ALQ-196, ALQ-122, ALR-20, ALR-46, ALT-16 and ALT-32. Please note that the ALQ-172 is common to both ACC and AFSOC and preserving a common system for both platforms is highly desirable.  Respondents are asked to provide information on any present or near-term (2015) system/upgrade/concept/idea that meets the Air Force's desired capabilities. A CD identifying specific system desired capabilities will be made available with the CRFI release upon request from industry. Company responses should clearly indicate the solution(s) it is addressing and include a cover letter and a narrative summary of their approach as well as other pertinent data. Responses should include sufficient information (such as a plan of action and milestones) that desc! ribes how the recommended technologies/system would be able to meet the capabilities sought in this CRFI.  Additional instructions for responders are provided in the CD.
Wherever possible and practical, the utilization of open, digital, modular, scalable, sustainable and common architectures is encouraged. The responder's recommended solution(s) should include an implementation schedule for the development, procurement, and installation of possible solutions to include risk assessments and technology readiness levels. The goal is to develop a range of promising options at several capability and affordability levels. The response should define B-52H and AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H EW self-protection system ideas/solutions that are effective against current and future enemy threats and tactics. 
Respondents should characterize to what extent ECM suite commonality can practically be maintained between the B-52H and the AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H.  Respondents ECM suite solutions should strive to provide EW functionality in a manner that allows the system to respond to changing threat environments, allow network compatibility, and be reconfigurable to reap the benefits of evolving technology.  Respondents should provide an assessment (including potential costs and schedules) of any Group A changes necessary to implement their design.  Group A generally refers to parts or components (including software) that are permanently or temporarily installed in a configuration item to support, secure, interconnect, or accommodate the equipment in a Group B kit.  Upgrading may or may not require maintaining the existing group A provisions. Whereas, modifying or replacing with a new system implies a higher probability of extensive group A changes with non-recurring and recurring cost! s that should be quantified.
The technical solutions requested by this CRFI are comprehensive and, in some cases challenging.  The Air Force is looking to industry to identify solutions that address the bulk of them, but there is no assumption that one company can satisfy them all.  Therefore, companies that have partial solutions are encouraged to respond and address the extent to which their solutions provide answers to the technology challenges presented by this CRFI.  This feedback provides the Air Force with insights into what is readily available and where the Technology Readiness Level is for equipment that can meet these challenges.  It also provides an indication of what operational needs are most critical to costs and technical performance.  The Air Force plans to use this information to refine ACC and AFSOC 2012 POM planning exercises.
To aid in the evaluation of affordability, rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates should be provided. Data and information needed to perform these ROM estimates are provided within a separate capabilities document, which will be available on a CD or via special distribution.     GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: Relative to present system(s) capabilities, in general, responders' ECM suite solutions should exhibit greater reliability, have a reduced risk of obsolescence, be interoperable with other aircraft systems, and strive for ease of future re-configurability and technology insertion.  As stated earlier, specific effectiveness capability needs are provided under separate cover.  
DATA LIBRARY: The government will provide a electronic library (e.g. CDs) for responder's accessibility to government furnished information (GFI) data/documents.
SUMMARY: The 647th AESS/SYAB, ASC, AFMC, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio will manage this CRFI. Respondents may reply to this CRFI within 60 days of this notice to: Chief, EW Plans Office, 647th AESS/SYAB, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433.  Electronic responses may be sent to:  Wilke, Michael A CTR USAF AFMC 647 AESS/SYAB [Michael.Wilke.ctr@wpafb.af.mil] or Quillin, Linda F Civ USAF AFMC 647 AESS/SYAB [Linda.Quillin@wpafb.af.mil].
 To further define CRFI information needs, an exchange of information between industry and government may be achieved by an industry day and/or one-on-one meetings with respondents to clarify the intent and resolve concerns.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond.  All responses submitted will be reviewed and assessed.  All submissions properly marked will be considered proprietary and treated in accordance with their markings.
Companies will be required to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the marking and transmittal of all information.

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to issue a sole source purchase order award to International Doors.  The Great Lakes Air and Marine location has an urgent requirement for hangar door repairs in its primary aircraft hangar.  Only 1 of the 3 doors is functioning which is affecting operations.  Lack of proper timers and limit switches creates a safety hazard.  International Doors is the intended vendor because they built and installed these doors approximately 30 years ago and is the only vendor familiar enough with the doors to repair them appropriately.  

Great Lakes Air and Marine is leasing their facility from the United States Air Force, and the Air Force has specific requirements as to hangar door operations and safety.  International Doors is the vendor used exclusively by the USAF at Selfridge ANGB, which is where Great Lakes Air and Marine is housed.

<DESC>NASA has a requirement for printing and mail support services to support theJohnson Space Center (JSC).  NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a6-month contract extension to GeoControl Systems, Inc. on a sole source basis.	Thisextension will allow for the continuation of services for NASA JSC from May 3, 2009, toNovember 2, 2009.  This will result to an issuance of a task order against thisIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.While the 6-month extension is in effect, NASA will compete this effort with award of anew contract estimated to take place on or before approximately November 3, 2009.NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from GeoControl Systems Inc., from May 3,2009 through November 2, 2009.	The authority cited permitting other than full and opencompetition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source and no other supplies orservices will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not believe thatcompeting this effort at this time is it's best interest, since the period of performancefor this extension is only 6 months.  The phase-in costs and time involved intransitioning to a new contractor and establishing relationships with the variousaffected parties for this effort would far outweight any cost savings achieved throughcompetition.The contractor will provide products and services in two primary activities; 1)Duplication and Printing, and 2)Mail and Distribution.	 The contractor will operate aninstallation-based duplicating and printing program to support all JSC program, projectand institutional requirements.  The contractor shall provide the JSC mail pick-up,processing, and delivery.The primary work areas for this contract extension are the Johnson Space Center, Houston,Texas, and related operations at Ellington Field (EF), Houston, Texas, and Sonny CarterTraining Facility (SCTF), Houston, Texas.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon April 28, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC><p>Background: The National Assessment Governing Board is an independent, bipartisan board that sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as The Nation's Report Card. NAEP makes objective information on student performance available to policy-makers and the public at the national, state, and local levels. It has served an important role in evaluating the condition and progress of American education for more than three decades.
<p>Created by Congress in 1988, the Governing Board is made up of 26 members, including governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators and researchers, business representatives, and members of the general public.

<p>Requirements: The Governing Board is seeking a contractor to conduct content alignment studies for the grade 12 NAEP in reading and in mathematics with the SAT and ACCUPLACER in these subjects. The purpose of content alignment studies is to evaluate the extent to which the grade 12 NAEP is aligned in content and complexity with the comparable subject tests, i.e. reading and mathematics, in the SAT and the ACCUPLACER, both tests of the College Board. A total of four alignment studies will be implemented: one for each of two subjects for two assessments. A content alignment design based on the Webb methodology will be utilized to guide development and implementation of the procedure, and that design is to be used for developing the proposal and for implementing the studies. This design will be posted on the Governing Board web site at www.nagb.org no later than April 24, 2009.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract. There is no incumbent contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address: <br />National Assessment Governing Board<br />800 North Capitol Street, NW, Suite 825<br />Washington, D.C. 20002-4233 <br /><br />The Request for Proposals will be issued approximately April 27, 2009.

<DESC>Design/Bid/Build (Pipeline removal) services for Casco Bay-to-Brunswick Naval Air Station Pipeline, Harpswell and Brunswick, Maine
This RFP will be issued to obtain contractor qualifications for which a contract, by means of a negotiated firm fixed-price procurement, will be awarded.  A contract will be awarded to the best value offeror in accordance with FAR PART 15 using the Best Value selection procedures.  This solicitation will be issued as N40085-09-R-7031.
The contract will provide removal of a 7.25 mile portion of pipeline that extends through privately held properties from the northern boundary of Mitchell Field in Harpswell, Maine (formerly the Defense Fuel Support Point (DFSP)-Casco Bay fuel terminal) to the southern boundary of the Brunswick Naval Air Station.  This portion of the pipeline consists of a 30 foot wide easement and right-of-way through South Harpswell and Brunswick, Maine.  The pipeline consists of two separate pipes that were used to transfer jet fuel, primarily JP-5, from 1952 until 1991 when the pipeline was taken out of service.  The pipeline is constructed of two separate carbon steel pipes with welded joints, tar exterior coating, and a fire resistant asbestos wrapping.  The depth of the pipeline ranges from approximately 1.7 to 7.3 feet below ground surface with an average depth of 3.5 feet below ground surface.  The total amount of land disturbance that would be required to remove the pipeline is app! roximately 26.36 acres.  The proposed pipeline removal includes clearing selected portions the land easement containing the pipeline; excavation of the pipeline; and processing removal of the asbestos-containing wrapping and steel pipe.
Portions of the 7.25 mile long easement and right-of-way may need to be cleared.  The easement consists of 115 parcels of private property in South Harpswell and Brunswick, Maine.  A utility survey is required to identify utility right-of-ways and where public and private utilities are present within the easement.  Wetlands are present along the easement.  Routine maintenance of the pipeline easement ceased when the pipeline became inactive in 1991; therefore, clearing selected portions of the 30 foot wide easement would be necessary to allow movement of excavation equipment and haulers to transport the removed sections of pipeline.
The entire 7.25 mile pipeline is required to be removed and includes aboveground and underground fuel system piping and associated appurtenances located within the easement.  From the fuel terminal in Harpswell, the pipeline consists of a 6 inch diameter pipe and a 10 inch diameter pipe which both extend one mile to a concrete "scraper pit."  The scraper pit is a partially buried concrete vault, approximately 26 feet long 22.5 feet wide , and 7.5 feet deep, used for accessing and cleaning the pipelines.  At the scraper pit, the 10 inch pipe is reduced to an 8 inch pipe.  From the scraper pit, the 8 inch pipe and the 6 inch pipe extend the remaining 6.25 miles to Brunswick Naval Air Station.  Associated appurtenances include concrete markers, pipeline signage, cathodic protection system test stations, the scraper pit structure, and various values, fittings, and flanges connected to the pipeline (including asbestos-containing gaskets) located within the scraper pit structure. !  The pipeline was drained, cleaned ("pigged"), and pressurized with nitrogen in 1991 when the pipeline became inactive.  Pressurization with nitrogen was maintained until August 1995, when the pressure was lost due to demolition of the valve system at the Brunswick Naval Air Station fuel farm.  Following removal of the pipeline, an assessment of soils directly below the original location of the pipeline is required.  Soil samples are required to be collected in duplicate at 25 foot intervals along the length of the pipeline and initially screed on-site using a photo ionization detector.  Site restoration includes rough grading along the easement with imported clean backfill, as well as driveway and roadway crossings repaired to applicable state or town requirements.  Stabilization of disturbed soils includes finish grading and native grass seed application.
The steel pipe is wrapped with a tar exterior coating and a fire resistant asbestos wrapping.  The asbestos wrapping may be considered friable under deteriorated conditions; however, in general this type of wrapping in non-deteriorated condition may be considered a non-friable asbestos-containing material (ACM).
Transportation and disposal of ACM waste are regulated by Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).  Friable asbestos can be transported by Maine DEP licensed "non-hazardous waste transporter" to a landfill approved to accept friable asbestos.  Intact non-friable asbestos waste, which is removed whole, can be disposed of at landfills in accordance with the landfill's license requirements.
The budget magnitude is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.
The estimated Contract Completion for the project with all options is 365 days from notice to proceed.
The contractor shall provide all required design, engineering, labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies and transportation to perform all work described in the specifications.  Proposals will be evaluated based on their technical merits for the identified criteria. All technical factors/sub factors are of equal importance. Technical is approximately equal to price.  The Basis of Award for this procurement shall be based on price and technical merits, which together, constitute a best value to the Government; however, not necessarily the lowest price.  The objective is selection of a contractor whose overall proposal demonstrates the best value to the Government based on the specified criteria.

(ASI), dba ASI, 990 North 8000 West, Petersboro, UT 84325-9758 on a sole source basis for technical support in the development of a new system for deployment of the Navy's common neutralizer.  This requirement includes enhanced system performance, incorporation of a standards based (JAUS/AS4) Open Architecture, and development of autonomous behaviors.  The Operator Control Unit (OCU) utilized for this effort must be suitable for Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) control.  Prior efforts by NSWC PCD have taken MOBIUS, an OCU developed by ASI, and adapted it for use by one of the UUVs used by the Navy.  This task will capitalize on those previous efforts and add additional UUV functionality.  This effort will build on the MOBIUS version Mobius Hercules v3.0.25956.  This version of MOBIUS is ASI proprietary, as such, ASI is the only source able to affect any updates.  Results!  will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code:  541330  PSC:  R425

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-01-C-0037 with  Northrop Grumman Corporation, Integrated Systems Eastern Region, Melbourne, FL to develop producibility upgrades and provide spare subsystems (gimbal etc) for the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) Block I system engineering development model. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the COBRA system since the competitive award of the conceptual design phase with options for the System Demonstration and Development (SD&D) phase of the program (Contract No. N61331-01-C-0037) in FY 2001 with the SD&D option being exercised in FY05.  Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to develop these modifications it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing t! he expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully develop the producibility upgrades. Unrecoverable duplicative costs and unacceptable schedule delays would result if award were made to any other source.

<a href="mailto:mustard.anna@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Peters at the University of Iowa for professional services for passive sampling assessment of spatial variability of  PM10-2.5  for the Cleveland Multiple Air PollutantStudy (CMAPS).  Dr. Thomas Peters (Principal Investigator) and his research group at the University of Iowa, including Dr. Naresh Kumar, were instrumental in the design and execution of the passive sampling effort in Cleveland (Cleveland Scoping Study, summer of 2008) which serves as the basis for the proposed passive sampling effort in the CMAPS. In the Cleveland Scoping Study, Dr. Peters and his research group generated a preliminary estimate of PM10-2.5 variability within the Cleveland urban area using Dr. Kumar's unique spatial model based on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from historic satellite data. The same approach will be used for this requirement to provide a comparison between PM10-2.5 concentration surfaces determined by passive samplers versus the University of Iowa spatial model. Dr. Peters' research group designed the passive sampler rain shelter which is being deployed in CMAPS and has pioneered methods for using passive samplers in the field and for the analysis of passive samples by optical microscopy.  The summer 2009 passive sampling effort for CMAPS will consist of 5 week-long sampling periods at approximately 25 sites. The University of Iowa, Thomas Peters, Principal Investigator, shall assist the EPA in selecting sampling sites; prepare optical passive samplers for the 5-week study; assist in field deployment of first set of samplers; analyze optical passive samplers to determine PM10-2.5 concentrations; compare passive PM10-2.5 concentrations with co-located active PM10-2.5 data; compare passive PM10-2.5 concentrations with Kumar's spatial model predictions; compare Kumar's spatial modeling approach to land-use-regression approach employed by EPA for the Cleveland study; analyze spatial variability in PM10-2.5 chemical composition using computer-controlled SEM (CCSEM) data provided by the Project Officer (PO).  Period of performance for this order will be 12 months from date of award.  The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1, "...contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available..."  Interested persons seeking to challenge the sole source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to provide the requirements within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of an RFQ will be ignored.  No RFP/RFQ will be made available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  Submit responses to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attention:  Anna Mustard, RTP Procurement Operations Div. (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Quest Software, Support Renewals Representative, 6500 Emerald Parkway, Suite 400, Dublin, OH  43016 for renewal of Security Manager Software maintenance.  Netpro Computing Inc. was the known proprietor of this software but has since sold the software request to Quest Software.

Application, resource access and permissions is controlled by the window’s complex repository called the Active Directory which contains security policies and attributes. Change Auditor and Security Manager will uniquely provide SSA with a means to manage the heath and security of our infrastructure along with giving us a way to control in real time what is occurring in Active Directory.  SSA intends to purchase Plus Change Auditor for Active Directory for 18,000 users over an 11 month time period, Plus Security Manager for Active Directory for 18,000 users over an 11 month period, Change Auditor for Active Directory for 3,200 users over a 12 month period, Change Auditor License for Active Directory for 14,500 users over a 9 month period, and Security Manager for Active Directory License for 14,500 over a 9 month period.  The period of performance for this software maintenance is 06/07/2009 through 06/06/2010.  

All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  If SSA does not identify any other acceptable sources capable of providing this requirement, SSA may issue a sole source award to Quest Software under the authority of FAR Part 13.106(b)(1).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Acquisition Center (RDECOM-AC) intends to award a purchase order in the amount of $78,343.00 on the basis of other than full and open competition to STS International for the warranty support for the Combat Medic Basic and Advanced Trauma Trainer (CoMBATT) prototype currently undergoing testing with the Brigade Combat Team Trauma Training (BCT3).  The anticipated period of performance will be six months.<BR><BR>The RDECOM-STTC determined full and open competition is not possible for the following reasons:<BR><BR>"	The Army CoMBATT trailer prototype is undergoing test and experimentation with the BCT3 team at training exercises across the Army.  In order to support these exercises, technicians capable of transporting, installing, running and fixing the system are required.  In order for another vendor to be able to perform this effort, substantial duplication of cost to the Government would be incurred which would not be recovered through competition.  <BR>"	Software changes to the CoMBATT control system are required as issues are identified during testing.  Substantial software reengineering would be required for any other vendor to make these changes.  This would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.  <BR>"	The CoMBATT prototype is required to be reconfigurable to work at ever changing test sites.  Other vendors would incur substantial costs which would not be recouped in a full and open competition.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541330.  A response to this notice is not required.     See Note 22.  Email your questions to RDECOM Contracting Center - Aberdeen at nikia.s.jelks@us.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>

At the southern end of the IHNC near the Mississippi River is an existing navigation lock, planned to be replaced by a new 110-foot-wide by 1,200-foot structure currently under design and construction. At the northern end of the IHNC are the Senator Ted Hickey Bridge, a dual bascule bridge, and the Seabrook Railroad Bridge, a single bascule bridge opening.  These bridges are equipped with lift spans to permit passage of taller waterborne vessels. The majority of the protection along the federal system is floodwall. The western floodwalls tie into a levee on the south side of the railroad, with several floodgates located along the existing federal line of protection, including a roadway gate for a lower access road and a railroad gate on the west end of the channel.  There is a scour hole located in the northern part of the IHNC south of the railroad. This scour hole spans the channel with a width of approximately 350 feet. It is approximately 1,050 feet long and 86 feet deep.  <BR><BR>Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3.  The evaluation criteria consist of five (5) Technical (non-cost) factors, each of which has additional sub-factors for evaluation, and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Experience; (2) Past Performance; (3) Preconstruction Services Management Plan; (4) Construction Approach; and (5) Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The resulting award will be a contract that includes a Firm Fixed-Price Base portion for preconstruction services and Fixed Price Incentive Option(s) for the construction phase.<BR><BR>Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD VOSB), HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.  The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR SubPart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting goals for this District are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be places with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBZone SB; (5) 3.0% for VOSB; and (6) at least 0.9% for SD VOSB.<BR><BR>Solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about May 6, 2009.<BR><BR>Point of contact for this notice is Virnelda J.

<DESC>This is sole source procurement for interim contract under the Other than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). The associated NAICS code is 621512. The West Palm Beach Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) intends to award an interim sole source contract for 180 days with one option of 180 days to extend to Inoveon Corporation to avoid interruption in patient care until the new contract solicitation is issued and awarded. VA Medical Center in West Palm Beach has a need for continuity of Diabetic Retinal Screening Services in accordance with Health Care Resources Contracting - Buying Title 38 U.S.C. as outlined in VA Directive 1663. VAMC is currently providing care to 14,365 diabetic patients. Eye screening has been shown to prevent avoidable loss of vision as well as being cost-effective. An interim contract is needed to avoid interruption of patient care and backlog of service.  Also, the service is needed to meet the performance measure target, 88% of diabetic patients must have a retinal screening examination documented. At this time, VAMC is meeting the performance measure only 70%. The current contractor is able to complete up to 24 screening examinations per day. The Eye Clinic does not have sufficient staffing or equipment to handle this volume of screening exams. If Eye Clinic staff is freed from having to do screening examinations, there is more time to follow up of patients with active eye diseases, thus improving timeliness of appointments in regard to this Performance Measure clinic. The contractor provides their own equipment, staffing, scheduling and reading services. The examination results are entered directly in CPRS.  Inoveon staff have completed background security checks, signed BAA as well as any an all other statue security requirements. Since no other company was found to provide the mentioned services, Inoveon Corporation was found to be the only source that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice of intend is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements, may give written notification to the Contract Specialist. Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.<br />MARKET RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED to identify potential suppliers of raw material will be used in modification of a 4000 psia process system that operates at temperatures from ambient down to -100 degrees Fahrenheit. The raw material includes high pressure, low temperature piping (approx 300 linear feet), and related components such as long radius elbows (5 each), short radius elbows (2 each), tees (1 each), weld-o-lets (8 each), hubs and flanges (four sets). This SA350-LF3 is the anticipated specification for carbon and low-alloy steel forgings, requiring notch toughness testing for piping components. SA333 is the anticipated specification for seamless and welded steel pipe for low-temperature service. The system will be of welded construction using the licensed Grey-Loc flange design. The size required is nominally 16 inch OD Schedule 160 (1.593 wall thickness). Variations in size are acceptable as long as all pipe, elbows, and hubs have the same inside diameter of nominally 13 inches with wall thickness complying with the ASME PV&amp;BC. Section 8, Division 1.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR SOLICITATION. The Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson Laboratories, in Jefferson, Arkansas, is seeking large and small business sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and 8(a) certified companies capable of providing the following services and supplies. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort.

The government is seeking potential sources to provide or develop the following for flow cytyometric reagents for detecting pathogenic bacterial agents in food. The targeted agents are Campylobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio spp. These reagents must fluoresce under 488 nm excitation and produce a strong signal in a typical cytometric FL1 channel (525nm) but not significantly in FL2 or FL3 regions. The finished product shall also include additional modifiers that eliminate or significantly reduce assay-confounding auto-fluorescence from the food particles. 

Acceptable detection of a single CFU can be achieved by a four hour grow out in TSB under agent-optimal incubation conditions from a 10^0 level inoculation followed by 5 uM filtration or other minimal sample preparation, <10 minute incubation, and cytometric detection within 5 minutes in 250 uL of the TSB.

Linear dynamic range should be 4 logs or greater.

"Competitive" criteria mean that the target organism is correctly detected and counted in the presence of up to a 10^6 excess of a typical non-pathogenic bacterial food contaminant.

Inclusivity and exclusivity specifications vary with each agent but mean: 
for inclusivity, successful detection of those pathogenic species and strains well known as typically found in the US food supply.
for exclusivity, lack of signal from non-target bacterial organisms commonly found in the same foods as the target.
 
Potential contractors must indicate business size and proof of any set-aside certification and provide a contact name, the mailing address, phone number and email address of point of contact. Capability statements must reference similar work that has been performed by the contractor in the last three (3) years, a description of the work performed and contact information for references knowledgeable about the quality of the work completed.  

Interested Contractors must respond with a capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail, fax or email to the point of contact listed below on or before Monday May 4, 2009 by 13:00 hours (Central Standard Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OSS/OFFAS, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-320, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502.

These efforts are in direct support of NASA systems programs and otherGovernment programs and strategies.  The objective of this effort shall be met byfostering technology innovation, encouraging new approaches, and working together withNASA, Department of Defense (DoD), other Government Agencies and international partners.1.2	HistoryThe NASA Acquisition Pollution Prevention (AP2) Program Office was established in 1998through a NASA HQ/Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Memorandum of Agreement to form an AP2Principal Center.  The purpose of the Office was to be the focal point for assisting theAgency in eliminating or reducing their use of ozone depleting substances, volatileorganic compounds, and hazardous materials throughout the life cycle of space and groundsupport systems. Because of the pervasiveness of many NASA environmental problems andbenefits of collaboration, the NASA AP2 Program mandated the projects undertaken be of ajoint nature. The AP2 office supported DoD P2 efforts through its participation with suchentities as the Joint Group on Pollution Prevention (JG-PP).  As NASA operations require us to deal with the international community as a customer andour suppliers (both domestic and international) become more involved in a global market,product lines do not always continue to cater to our unique requirements.  This can becaused by global supply and demand as well as foreign regulations that govern bothmanufacture and import of specific hazardous materials.  Our international interactionsaddress these problems along with common infrastructure risks with partners abroad.To facilitate the international collaboration, in September 2002 NASA entered into JointStatement with the Portuguese Ministry of Urban Affairs, Spatial Planning and theEnvironment to cooperate on Matters of the Environment.  The operating entities for theNASA agreement are the NASA Environmental Management Division and a newly formedconsortium Centro Para Preveno da Poluio (Center for Pollution Prevention) (C3P) asset forth in the Terms of Reference.  It is critical that these internationalrelationships that are heavily invested be maintained without interruption ordegradation.  The Joint Statement and Terms of Reference are attachments 1 and 2respectively.In 2007 it was recognized that the philosophy and activities of the AP2 Office hadexpanded well beyond those embodied in the MOU and inferred by the AP2 namesake.  A newMOU between NASA HQ and the Kennedy Space Center was signed changing the name to theTechnology Evaluation for Environmental Risk Mitigation (TEERM) and incorporated the fullrange of environmentally driven risk mitigation activities envisioned at the time.  Therecognition that infrastructure issues such as energy cost and availability can poseenvironmentally-driven mission risks expands the contract scope accordingly.This contract not only supports the TEERM office but also any otherenvironmentally-driven infrastructure or programmatic risk management requirementsthroughout the Agency.	This has included support to the Shuttle Environmental AssuranceInitiative through MSFC and the Energy Management Function and Environmental Managementactivities from HQ.1.3	Path forwardTwo current situations will drive additional requirements on this contract  one domesticand one international.	The domestic development involves probable increasing interactionwith other US space asset-using organizations and the asset ground support equipment. This will require TOP SECRET clearance for these interactions.The international development involves an evolution of the Joint Statement to alegally-binding international agreement.  The new agreement will now occur in two phases. The agency-to-agency agreement under US law will be signed just before or early into thecontract period of performance and will require close coordination with the Portugueserepresentatives to begin performing activities under the new agreement.  Thegovernment-to-government agreement process will start soon after the agency-to-agencyagreement is signed and will take approximately one year to finalize.2	ObjectiveThe objective of this contract is to reduce NASAs environmentally-driven infrastructureand programmatic risks through project and management activities both domestic andinternational.3	Scope 3.1	General RequirementsThe Contractor shall provide the necessary management, engineering, technical, andadministrative personnel, material and all other items essential to the performance of	the assigned tasks unless the SOW specifies otherwise.	It is critical that all currentprojects be continued without adverse effect to the stakeholders and without additionalrisk to the Agency Mission or in a manner that jeopardizes current and futurepartnerships. The Contractor shall travel to government and other contractor sites,including international locations, and other locations as required in accomplishing thisSOW.3.1.1	InterfacesThe successful execution of joint projects requires specialized experience and expertisein order to effectively combine a vast array of requirements into manageable projects andto obtain the resources needed to complete the projects in a manner that meets what oftencan be conflicting needs.  Because of the complexities involved, all projects shallfollow a structured project methodology.  Key aspects of this methodology include activeparticipation (consensus building and inclusiveness), identification of communities ofpractice to gain synergy and leverage resources, coalition building of partnerships amonggovernment, private, and non-profit organizations, multi-disciplinary andinter-disciplinary teaming, and thorough documentation of all major discussions,decisions and recommendations.The Contractor shall interface with personnel from our international partners, NASACenters, other Federal Agencies, Government contractors, and technology vendors in theperformance of technical and business support activities.  Contractor personnel will notprovide direction or otherwise interject themselves into relationships between theGovernment and other Government contractors.3.1.2	SecurityThe contractor will need the ability to work with TOP SECRET information on some tasks. Most of the tasks do not require security clearance.3.1.3	Work locationThe primary location for efforts assigned under this contract will be at KSC. When workis performed at KSC, the Government will provide all necessary office space andequipment.  However, Government provided office space is limited.  The Contractor willprovide the office space, office equipment and expendable supplies and all administrativesupport needed in excess of that provided by the Government.  Accomplishment of specifictasks may require tasks to be performed at other Government and contractor facilitiesthroughout the United States and foreign locations.3.1.4	TravelTravel to NASA and other Government installations, Contractor facilities and otherdesignated worldwide sites will be performed by the Contractor as necessary to completethe required work.  Travel will be estimated by the contractor and approved and funded bythe Government on each Delivery Order.	 The contractor shall invoice only actual travelcosts for this travel.

This support is to be provided within the framework where output materials and energyfrom one process can be effectively utilized by another (i.e., waste of one processbecomes food for another). The consequences of utilizing this design concept are systems(and systems of systems) which reuse materials indefinitely, have zero net waste, and useenergy efficiently. Potential activities utilizing this framework include the design ofmaterials, products, processes, hardware, and facilities that are inherently safe,regenerative and produce ecological and social value. At the early stages of development,these new system designs will embrace the concept that waste does not exist within theirlife cycle.These concepts are not new to NASA but, will become increasingly important as futuremissions take space exploration to distances further and further from our home planet andthose supporting Centers, facilities and processes continue to compete for everdecreasing and limited resources.All questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Candis Edwards-Duncan at301-286-4095 or Candis.J.Edwards-Duncan@nasa.gov.

Further communications regarding the Industry Day, including the date and location, will be provided at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm under Solicitation Number N00019-09-R-0238.  The information gathered as a result  of this Sources Sought will be utilized to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist for this effort.  All Small Business Set-Aside categories will be considered.  All work may  be performed at a location of the contractor’s choosing.

2.0  DISCLAIMER
THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THERE ARE NO FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

3.0  REQUIRED CAPABILITIES
3.1  Background
The current jamming system used in the Fleet is the ALQ-99 TJS which was designed in the late 1960’s and fielded with the introduction of the EA-6B in 1971.  The aging ALQ-99 TJS, also being used on the EA-18G, lacks the capability to match today’s complex Integrated Air Defense, communication, data link and non-traditional Radio Frequency (RF) threats.  The current architecture also faces challenges in further evolving to face future threats.  NGJ will adopt an adaptable, modular, and open architecture philosophy to combat the increasing capability gap and enable future growth at a reduced operations and sustainment cost.  
3.2	Program Objectives
Work under the NGJ TM contract will begin development and procurement of an effective, integrated, and affordable NGJ system with a projected Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of 2018 that:
•	Addresses fundamental ALQ-99 shortfalls/performance requirements
–	Degrading relative capability over time
–	Limited scalability, flexibility, supportability
–	Limited number of simultaneous targets
–	Limited Interoperability, availability
•	May implement mature technologies identified in NGJ Technology Maturation Trade Studies/AoA
•	Invokes a modular, scalable, open system architecture to ensure future growth and platform adaptability
3.3	 Phased Development Approach
The NGJ program will progress to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in four phases: a TM Phase (discussed herein), a TD Phase, an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, and a Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase.  

The purpose of this procurement is to complete the TM Phase, which will consist of the development of the required engineering and programmatic documentation required to support and conduct a Preliminary Design Review for a system-level NGJ Prototype to be built and demonstrated during the TD Phase.  

The contractor will present their design and development approaches for the NGJ Prototype through contractor and Government co-chaired Prototype and System design review processes.  This process will mirror the NAVAIR Systems Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process, with tailoring to ensure design rigor is commensurate with this prototyping phase. The contractor must show the relevancy of its Prototype in demonstrating technology maturity sufficient to enter EMD Phase.   The contractor must show that they possess the in-house breadth of experience and expertise to not only design the NGJ Prototype, but also implement the follow-on TD, EMD, and LRIP Phases of NGJ development, if selected as the Prime Contractor for future contracts.  It is anticipated that multiple Cost Plus Fixed Fee competitive awards will be made to offerors representing the best value to the Government.  The period of performance of this TM Phase contract is expected to be approximately 9 months.  

4.0  NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS)
The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) is AC12 and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  The NAICS Code is matched to size standards that are expressed as revenue (in millions of dollars) for companies providing services or expressed in number of employees for companies engaged in manufacturing. The size standard is 1,500 employees.

5.0  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There are currently trade study contracts awarded to demonstrate that the NGJ system meets the following broad conditions and constraints:   
•	Possess interoperability with U.S. Naval, joint and multi-national forces.
•	Be compatible with existing size, weight, and power constraints of the EA-18G in the Mod-escort/Stand-off mission profile as defined in Boeing NGJ EA-18G Integration Study report.
•	Employ designs based on a modular open systems approach (MOSA) that incorporate appropriate considerations for re-configurability, portability, maintainability, technology insertion, vendor independence, reusability, scalability, interoperability, upgradeability, and long-term supportability.
•	Be fully interoperable with a wide-variety of battle management command and control systems.
•	Achieve an optimum balance of mission effectiveness, operational availability (reliability, maintainability, supportability, manning, and human system integration) and life cycle cost.
•	Minimize the complexity of both integrating the system during EMD Phase on the host aircraft and that of the NGJ system itself.  Modifications to the aircraft and its existing systems, in lieu of incorporating functionality into the NGJ system, must reflect a positive business case which considers all applicable program factors (e.g. effectiveness, risk, life cycle cost, schedule, platform portability, & others).  

It is anticipated that any potential offeror will not repeat this work but
will consider these requirements when performing the tasks outlined in the contract.

<DESC>US Army, Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality ContractingCenter is seeking potential entities with experience in fire control, radar, and radar integrated real-time communications between a ground based radar and in-flight projectiles.  This effort will support further development of a 50mm Projectile for the Extended Area Protection and Survivability Program (EAPS). A proof of principle concept has been demonstrated to date.  The technology to be matured and demonstrated in the next phase is a 50mm projectile w/gun-hardened transceiver which receives command guidance and detonation commands at fixed stand-offs from the incoming threat, a radar capable of tracking multiple incoming threat targets, and multiple outgoing interceptors with the necessary communications link to these in-flight interceptors.  The fire control for the gun/turret system and command authority for the outgoing interceptors is required.  Four major elements of the envisioned developmental program and system are; gun system (each gun capable of launching 200 interceptors per minute), 50mm projectile (interceptor), fire control radar w/command link, and turret with associated drives. This announcement pertains to the fire control radar w/command link elements of the system.  Selected entities will be required to work with entities developing other elements of the system.  Responses should address concept, maturity of hardware, live fire testing of components, subsystems and systems, as well as developmental costs. Hardware and capabilities demonstrated to date should also be contained within the submission.  An integrated Fire Control/Radar subsystem solution should address the following requirements, some of which have been determined via simulation and or testing to date. 
-Fire Control Radar w/Integrate Communication Capability: Requirements of the EAPS program are to track up to ten (10) outgoing interceptors and multiple incoming threats.  The radar system must also have a communications capability to provide command divert/detonation to the outgoing interceptors.  Demonstrated capabilities to date for the communication link were 300Kb/sec telemetry and survivability to > 50kGs.  The telemetry and command link electronics have been allocated a max diameter of 28.7 mm and 23.6 mm length.  Incoming threats include but are not limited to 155mm artillery and mortars.  

-Search Detection and Cueing: Either a capability of the fire control radar (desirable), or a handoff from an alternate search / cueing radar, range TBD

           -Engagement intercept ranges: 300m min to 1500m maximum.
           -Development of fire control solutions for gun/turret system
-Development of command/control authority algorithms for the single course correction of the outgoing interceptors

-Development of 2.5 meter interceptor to target detonation range, accuracy < 0.5m

-Rate of Fire:  400 rounds/minute, a maximum burst of ten (10) rounds per threat

-Tracking Accuracy:  For both incoming threats and out-going interceptors 0.3 mil at 20dB SNR has been used in simulation and met requirements.

All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 14 May 2009 to U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ.  Please submit via E-mail to christina.nigro@us.army.mil.  Large files need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com). This market survey is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a formal solicitation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, Federal Acquisition Service, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Floor Mats to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>No commercial equivalents reported.</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Floor Mats to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 3</p>
<p>) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 5, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>

<DESC>Justification to Procure Using Other Than Full and Open CompetitionThe USFWS requires an Endangered Species Act expert to help develop a cooperativeBiological Assessment (BA) for the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project. This is anextremely important project for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The award will be made to  Mr.Moroz, 2090 Thompson Road, Nezperce, Idaho 83543, 208-937-0108 for the completion of this product. This product will be used to inform FWS and ultimately aid in the developmentof the Service's Biological Opinion for the project. The technical aspect of this project requiresspecific scientific knowledge. Mr. Moroz is uniquely qualified to complete this work because of hisextensive experience writing BAs and his prior Federal experience specifically workingwith Idaho Power Company to complete projects related to this relicensing effort  Mr. Morozwas previously employed by the Service and the U.S. Forest Service. A major source ofhis work was writing biological opinions for various Federal and private entities. Mr. Moroz successfully completed work on a very long, all encompassing BA for the IdahoRoadless Rule. Because of the urgency and uniqueness of this assignment, Mr Moroz is theonly choice because he requires no training or other start-up time to become familiar withthe project and his experience qualifies him to complete this important assignment.Work need to begin May 2009 and be completed by December 2009 because of the ongoing relicenseprocess which is expected to be completed this year. A delay in award of the purchase orderwould result in the Fish and Wildlife Service not meeting its legal requirement. This is acooperative development effort between FWS and the Idaho Power Company.

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER THE ARCHITECT ENGINEERING SERVICE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) CONTRACT NUMBER IBM05D0001 WITH S&amp;B INFRASTRUCTURES, LTD.</p>
<p>The proposed levee/dike rehabilitation improvements consist of 1) raising the top-of-levee/dike elevation, 2) coordinating the work under this task order with the geotechnical investigations and testing being completed under a different task order to determine the type and extent of any required remediation improvements due to slope stability, seepage, levee/dike settlement, erosion, and any other geotechnical issues that may cause levee/dike failure during a 100-year flood event; 3) rehabilitating existing pipeline/culvert structures and appurtenances located within the levee/dike by modifying them to be in accordance with the raised levee/dike cross-section, repairing gates and gatewells, as required, and adding gates to ungated structures; and 4) design of new gated crossing structure, such as a culvert, on Lateral A Canal, owned by Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2 (HCID#2) at approximate coordinates of 98&deg;14'23.925"W 26&deg;5'32.41"N. The top elevation of the levee/dike-raising improvements will be as required to provide containment of design flood flows with a minimum freeboard of 3 feet for water surface elevations calculated in the USIBWC 2003 Hydraulic Model for the LRGFCP. In general, work requirements in this Scope of Work will be sufficient to lead into contracting and performance of construction of the proposed levee/dike improvements on the Lateral A to Donna Pump Levee and Retamal Dike Reach, except for a 0.9 mile length of existing levee/floodwall combination in the Lateral A to Donna Pump reach, just northwest of Donna Pump. In addition, the SOW also provides for Survey Control Maps for USIBWC internal use and records.</p>
<p>The resulting negotiated Task Order will be synopsized and issued under&nbsp; the previously competed and existing Firm Fixed Price Singe Award IDIQ A/E contract referenced above.</p>

CWMS relational database tables will be expanded and an Application Programming Interface (API) created to access the data.   Legacy daily, monthly, and annual report database applications used within SWF, SWT, and across the USACE water management community will be replaced with database applications which will be integrated into CWMS.  Services sought include programming in JAVA, C and C++, the accepted standardized programming languages for HEC-DSSVUE and CWMS.  The contract will also involve travel and participation in meetings regarding the initiatives.  The project is a multi-phase collaborative effort expected to take up to 5 years to complete and is a follow on contract for the continued development of these database applications.  This contract is estimated to cost $550,000 or less.  The period of performance for this contract will not exceed five (5) years from the date of award.<BR><BR>RMA is a primary developer for CWMS and has also participated in the design and development of each of the newest generation of HECs software including HMS, RAS, FDA, FIA, ResSim, ResPRM, and DSSVue.  Any other course of procurement would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government and would create delays of one to two years, for reproducing work RMA has already performed on the project, in fulfilling Reservoir Control Sections requirements.  These costs would not be recovered through competition.  <BR><BR>To be eligible to receive a Government contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to procure Safway scaffolding for the CEV Crew Moduleto be installed at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico the week of May 11, 2009.  Scaffolding Requirements:Using Safway materials, construct scaffolding that provides 360 degree access to the crewmodule (CM) at two levels and splits in half to allow for easy removal of the CM from thescaffolding.  The CM is a cone shape with a rounded base and the point of the cone is cutoff.  The base of the CM is 16 feet in diameter at its widest point and the top is about8.5 feet in diameter at the level of the top platform (the Forward Bay).  The CM isresting on a fixture with casters (the CMTF) that holds the CM about three feet off thefloor at the CM's lowest point.  The CMTF is a 17 foot by 18 foot rectangular frame thatsupports the CM and is about 3 feet 8 inches.  The scaffolding should be on adjustablecasters to make it easy to roll away from the CM and make it easy to adjust the height ofthe platforms by a few inches in either direction. The scaffolding must be stand-alone;it may not rest on the CM or CMTF at any point.  o	Upper PlatformX	12 feet off the groundX	Must provide 360 degree access to the CMX	Roughly 5 foot wide platform completely encircling the Forward BayX	Must leave a gap of 6 inches or less between the edge of the platform and the CMForward Bay(This results in an outer diameter of about 20 feet and an inner diameter of about 10feet on the upper platform)o	Lower PlatformX	4 feet off the groundX	Must provide 360 degree access to the CMX	Four, 4ft by 7ft platforms spaced around the CMo	Wood may be used to get the work platforms close to the CMo	All the wood surfaces must be cut and placed to provide an even walking surfaceand avoid tripping hazards.o	StaircaseX	Only one staircase is required, however, it must be removable and must beattachable to both halves of the scaffolding.X	It must be a "single-wide" staircase, there may NOT be a turn in the stairs.*All dimensions are approximate.

EVALUATION FACTORS

Quotations received shall first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost. Those quotations considered technically acceptable shall then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall decision. All evaluation factors, other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Primary consideration shall be given to the evaluation of the technical rather than cost or price. It is pointed out, however; should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, the cost or price could become primary.

Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose quotation provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as quotations become more equal based on the other factors. This evaluation shall be based upon the completeness and thoroughness of the quotation submitted. The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the request for quotation are understood and offer a logical consistent program for their achievement. 

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. The merits of each quotation will be evaluated carefully. Each quotation must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFQ. Offeror must submit information sufficient to evaluate their quotations based on the detailed criteria listed below.

	POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

The evaluation criteria are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical quotations. The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance.

A) Experience and Capability of Facility	
(1) Provide seminar space and coordinate room set up. 
(2) Provide working lunch space and coordinate room-set and food service.
(3) Provide audiovisual equipment and coordinate set up. 
(4) Provide audiovisual technician for audiovisual support. 

(B) Understanding the Scope of Work    

Provide a comprehensive statement of the scope and purpose of the project to demonstrate complete understanding of the intent and requirements. State the overall objectives and the specific accomplishments you hope to achieve. Indicate the rationale for your plan, and the relationship to comparable work in progress elsewhere.

(1) Knowledge and understanding of the Scope of Work is demonstrated by the clarity, practicality, and appropriateness of the offeror’s quotation and plan to accomplish the effort. 

(2) Demonstrate recognition and ability to overcome potential difficulties in the performance of the project. 

(C) Past Performance    
Facility shall submit a list of three (3) references. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers. 

(D) Price 
The Government will review the price schedules for completeness and accuracy.  A determination will be made as to whether the Offerors have properly completed the price schedules.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness by comparison to published market rates, independent Government cost estimates; prices for similar items obtained through market research; and other contract prices.

<DESC>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity is seeking innovative solutions through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Reynard Program, which is envisioned to begin in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2009 and end by 2012.

Events in today’s world move at an accelerating pace, and are often shaped by information (whether correct or incorrect) that is communicated by diverse and increasingly novel means. A nuanced picture of events and attitudes is required to inform policy developers and other decision-makers in this complex and fast-paced environment. IARPA sponsors leading-edge research to help the Intelligence Community keep abreast of the many sources of information needed to inform our nation’s leadership. A new channel for information exchange and social interaction is emerging with the growing popularity of Virtual Worlds (VWs) and Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). Industry experts predict the number of VW users will exceed a half billion by the end of 2009. As participation in these VWs broadens and deepens, the need for understanding the nature of interactions in these worlds arises.

Starting from the premise that Real World (RW) characteristics are reflected in VW behavior, the IARPA Reynard program seeks to identify behavioral indicators in VWs and MMOGs that are related to the RW characteristics of the users. Performers in the Reynard program will be expected to produce one or more VW behavioral indicators that serve to identify RW attributes of individuals or groups. Attributes of interest include the following: gender, approximate age, economic status, educational level, occupation, ideology or “world view”, degree of influence, “digital native” vs “digital immigrant,” approximate physical geographic location, native language, and culture. Other RW characteristics might also be empirically deduced through behavioral indicators. VW behavioral indicators may be examined in the areas of Avatars and Representation, Communication, Things That Avatars Do, Group Formation and Dynamics, Money and Economics, and Cultural Differences.

The Reynard program will be structured into two 18-month phases. Multiple awards are anticipated for Phase 1. Performance against the Phase 1 metrics will be a key factor in determining whether a performer will continue on to Phase 2.

Proposals must be received at or before 5:00pm ET on June 16, 2009. For more information, please go to www.iarpa.gov/solicitations.html and click on the links for IARPA-BAA-09-05.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
Commandant (CG-9131)
1900 Half Street, S.W. (JR11-0203)
Washington, DC 20593
Telephone: (202) 372-3692
Fax: (202) 475-3904

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is May 06, 2009, 4:00 E.S.T.  Anticipated award date is approximately 2 weeks after close of solicitation.  Proposals are to remain in effect for a minimum of 60 days after close of solicitation.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the attention of Steven Metcalfe at (252) 335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead and include the nomenclature, part number, unit price and extended price, FOB point, payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification, delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

6.  Research Opportunity Description

6.1 Background

Executive Order (EO) 13423 of January 24, 2007, sets agency goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3 percent annually through the year 2015 or 30 percent by the end of fiscal year 2015, relative to the baseline of the agency’s energy use in fiscal year 2003.  Renewable sources of energy allow the Coast Guard to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing dependency on grid electrical power.  Since most Coast Guard facilities are located along coastal portions of the United States, they are positioned to take advantage of a number of natural renewable/sustainable sources for clean electrical power.  

The Coast Guard wants to demonstrate the use of in-stream tidal current to supplement electrical power at the pier of Coast Guard Station Eastport, Maine.  A demonstration period would be used to evaluate the viability of tidal current power being used to augment station electrical power; and support the goals outlined in EO 13423.  

The Government anticipates that a successful system would be installed in the vicinity of the Coast Guard Station Eastport’s pier supplementing the electrical power provided to the Coast Guard station and/or pier.  The demonstration shall be no less than 60 days and no more than 12 months.  The Government prefers a 12 month demonstration period. 

6.2 Scope

The scope of this BAA includes obtaining the necessary local, state and federal government permits and approvals to install and operate a system, developing the site design for installing a system and modifying the pier’s electrical system to accommodate a demonstration, providing and installing an operational in-stream tidal current electrical generator, and removal of the system and restoration of the existing pier electrical system after the demonstration.

6.3 In-Stream Tidal Current Generator Demonstration

The successful demonstration shall have the following capabilities:
1)	Able to obtain all necessary operating approvals and permits before the scheduled installation date.
2)	Able to use the tidal current available in the vicinity of the Coast Guard pier in Eastport, ME. 
3)	Able to provide electrical power to the Coast Guard Station Eastport floating small boat dock, or power a portion of other Station facilities.
4)	Able to measure useable electrical power being provided to the pier or facility (e.g. using a meter or similar device).
5)	Able to operate through all environmental conditions.
6)	System operation does not adversely affect operations at or around the pier.
7)	Able to repair the device and restore service if there is an equipment failure.

Note: Items 1 and 7 shall be addressed in the proposal.  Item 1 shall be addressed by describing the necessary permits and approvals, how/when they shall be obtained to meet the planning/installation schedule. Item 7 shall be addressed by describing the terms of maintenance and repair, including times for response if the device is not operable.  Items 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be evaluated directly by the Government during the demonstration period.

The demonstration has a target start date of August 31, 2009.  Emphasis during the demonstration will be on performance capabilities, maintainability, and reliability.  The recording of usable electrical power over the demonstration period and the evaluation of demonstrated technology will be conducted by the Government.  Offerors have the opportunity to be creative in their selection of technical approach.

8.  Point(s) of Contact

Questions prior to the submission of proposals may be addressed to the technical point of contact, John.A.Natale@uscg.mil or (860) 271-2880.  Questions after the submission of proposals must be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Joyce.M.Overton@uscg.mil or (860) 271-2886. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

9.  Additional Information

This announcement is restricted to work relating to installing a tidal power generator, followed by a demonstration period.  The demonstration shall be no less than 60 days and no more than 12 months.  The Government prefers a 12 month demonstration period. Awards made under this BAA are for scientific study and analysis directed towards developing a system to provide electrical power from available tidal currents.  

Any hardware or software developed under a contract resulting from this BAA will be retained by the Offeror.  The Coast Guard does not expect to own the power generation capability (i.e., prototypes or preproduction models).  

II. AWARD INFORMATION 

Award of the effort as a result of this announcement will be in the form of a contract.  Award will be made to one or more Offerors whose proposals are considered to be of the highest technical importance to the Government in accordance with the evaluation criteria, taking into consideration the available funding.  It is anticipated that a firm fixed price (FFP) contract will be awarded.  

The period of performance of the award will be 15 months.  RDC anticipates a budget of $100,000 for the total program.  The anticipated date of contract award is approximately July 31, 2009.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology of this proposal for exclusive competition among those entities.  

IV. PROPOSALS

The due date for receipt of proposals is 2:00 p.m. (local time) on May 29, 2009.  It is anticipated that final selections will be made approximately 30 days after proposal submission.  As soon as the final proposal evaluation process is completed, Offerors will be notified via e-mail of selection or non-selection for award.  Contract awards will be based upon successful negotiations.

Proposals shall be delivered with one original, one copy, and one electronic copy compatible with Microsoft&#61666; Office 2003 on a CD-ROM.  Proposals shall be sent to:

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify additional questions in regards to solicitation:
<p>&bull; If individuals aren't able to attend the scheduled site visit on Thursday 5 March 2009 at 1:00, will they be allowed to provide a proposal? Yes, we will accept all proposals from responsible contractors.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures show a concrete pad, does the contractor need to install this pad as a base? Yes, this base we would expect the contractor to install.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures (provided in the 1st ammendment) show (3) core drilled bollards for impact protection, will the contractor have to install? Yes, the contractor would install.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures show plant power dropping to the deck. Would the contractor be expected to make that power drop connection? The contractor will be expected to hook the box to the Scissor Lift System.</p>
<p>&bull; McGuire AFB will support the power supply 120volt and 460volts.</p>
<p>&bull; The pictures show convenience outlets on the platform. Is that provided by the AFB or the contractor? They are provided by the contractor.</p>
<p>&bull; The lowered height restriction of 14" severely limits the number of vendors who can make the lift. Would you accept a 15-1/2" or 16" lowered height? Yes. This shouldn't be too big of an issue.</p>
<p>&bull; Can a contractor build a low profile conveying system on top of it to make up the 1-1/2" to 2" difference? Yes, this should be acceptable.</p>
<p>&bull; The write would lead one to believe the conveyor raises and lowers independently of the deck so pallets can either be sitting on the steel structure, or on non-powered rollers. They will be sitting on the Non-Powered rollers only.</p>
<p>ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME AT THE PROVIDED ADDRESS.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address to below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolutions. HQ Army Materiel Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703)806-886 or 8875 - Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Materiel Command, Office of Command Counsel, Oom 2-1SE3401, 1412 Jackson Loop, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-level protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp  - If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures.

Thus the acceptable plasticity range is stated as a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10.  During performance of the contract, all delivered or received gravel must meet the Section 703 requirements.

Q: Why was the due date extended, if you are able to tell me?

A: To allow additional time for offerors to obtain needed information.  The CG does not intend to extend further.

The current Yongsan Relocation Plan (YRP)/Land Partnership Program (LPP) master plan does not include an AAFES Bakery to provide quality of life services for service members, civilians and families. Eighth United States Army and the Installation Management Commd Korean Region Logistics Division have held discussions with the master planners on this issue in order to get this situation resolved.  The United States Forces Korea does not intend to designate a location for the bakery.  Bottom line is that vendor must be able to deliver baked goods that meet US standards for enrichment on a schedule to specified locations.<BR>

<DESC>TITLE: Upgrade/modification or replacement of the Radio Frequency (RF) Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Suite on the B-52H, AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H platforms   DESCRIPTION: The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) 647th Combat Electronics Squadron is conducting market research analyses in support of examining technology levels and potential system availability to upgrade/modify or replace the RF ECM self-protection suites on the B-52H and the AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H aircraft. ASC is issuing this CRFI to gather information in conjunction with on-going Air Force Electronic Warfare Capabilities Investment Strategy (AFEWCIS) activities in support of the AF EW Life Cycle Management Group (LCMG).  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This CRFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This CRFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, ASC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not p! ay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this CRFI.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  All costs associated with responding to this CRFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.  Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this CRFI in order to assist ASC in determining potential levels of technology/systems available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. Only responses from US companies will be accepted.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional inform! ation pertaining to this CRFI.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.
PROPRIETARY MATERIALS PROTECTION: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore acquisition options and strategies for the possible approaches within the military.  All information received in response to this CRFI that is properly marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly.  Proprietary information must be clearly marked on the outside container and on the materials inside.  The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages, for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Any materials submitted in accordance with this CRFI which contain information that is marked as proprietary will be protected as proprietary information.  Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as support contractor personnel hir! ed to provide technical assistance in assessing the responses, consulting on potential operational requirements refinement, and assisting the Government in the preparation of any resulting acquisition strategy.  All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905.  All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.  The Government has also determined that the contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.
Responders may provide a response to an upgrade option, a system modification, a new ECM suite, or any combination of these solutions.  However, if multiple solutions are presented each distinct solution should be fully documented as a complete response. The intent of this CRFI is to assist Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) with information needed to establish/refine operational requirements and set priorities for possible upgrades, modification or replacement of RF ECM systems on the B-52H and AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H. The goal is to identify new and existing technology investments that can that can provide the B-52H and AC/MC-130 the survivability assets essential to effective execution of their assigned missions. This CRFI includes all aspects of RF EW self-protection across all phases of combat. 
APPROACH: ASC 647th AESS (Combat Electronics Squadron) is requesting information on viable options that will upgrade/modify or replace the current B-52H and AC/MC-130 aircraft RF ECM self-protection suites, which include the ALQ-172, ALQ-155, ALQ-196, ALQ-122, ALR-20, ALR-46, ALT-16 and ALT-32. Please note that the ALQ-172 is common to both ACC and AFSOC and preserving a common system for both platforms is highly desirable.  Respondents are asked to provide information on any present or near-term (2015) system/upgrade/concept/idea that meets the Air Force's desired capabilities. A CD identifying specific system desired capabilities will be made available with the CRFI release upon request from industry. Company responses should clearly indicate the solution(s) it is addressing and include a cover letter and a narrative summary of their approach as well as other pertinent data. Responses should include sufficient information (such as a plan of action and milestones) that desc! ribes how the recommended technologies/system would be able to meet the capabilities sought in this CRFI.  Additional instructions for responders are provided in the CD.
Wherever possible and practical, the utilization of open, digital, modular, scalable, sustainable and common architectures is encouraged. The responder's recommended solution(s) should include an implementation schedule for the development, procurement, and installation of possible solutions to include risk assessments and technology readiness levels. The goal is to develop a range of promising options at several capability and affordability levels. The response should define B-52H and AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H EW self-protection system ideas/solutions that are effective against current and future enemy threats and tactics. 
Respondents should characterize to what extent ECM suite commonality can practically be maintained between the B-52H and the AC-130H/U and MC-130E/H.  Respondents ECM suite solutions should strive to provide EW functionality in a manner that allows the system to respond to changing threat environments, allow network compatibility, and be reconfigurable to reap the benefits of evolving technology.  Respondents should provide an assessment (including potential costs and schedules) of any Group A changes necessary to implement their design.  Group A generally refers to parts or components (including software) that are permanently or temporarily installed in a configuration item to support, secure, interconnect, or accommodate the equipment in a Group B kit.  Upgrading may or may not require maintaining the existing group A provisions. Whereas, modifying or replacing with a new system implies a higher probability of extensive group A changes with non-recurring and recurring cost! s that should be quantified.
The technical solutions requested by this CRFI are comprehensive and, in some cases challenging.  The Air Force is looking to industry to identify solutions that address the bulk of them, but there is no assumption that one company can satisfy them all.  Therefore, companies that have partial solutions are encouraged to respond and address the extent to which their solutions provide answers to the technology challenges presented by this CRFI.  This feedback provides the Air Force with insights into what is readily available and where the Technology Readiness Level is for equipment that can meet these challenges.  It also provides an indication of what operational needs are most critical to costs and technical performance.  The Air Force plans to use this information to refine ACC and AFSOC 2012 POM planning exercises.
To aid in the evaluation of affordability, rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates should be provided. Data and information needed to perform these ROM estimates are provided within a separate capabilities document, which will be available on a CD or via special distribution.     GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: Relative to present system(s) capabilities, in general, responders' ECM suite solutions should exhibit greater reliability, have a reduced risk of obsolescence, be interoperable with other aircraft systems, and strive for ease of future re-configurability and technology insertion.  As stated earlier, specific effectiveness capability needs are provided under separate cover.  
DATA LIBRARY: The government will provide a electronic library (e.g. CDs) for responder's accessibility to government furnished information (GFI) data/documents.
SUMMARY: The 647th AESS/SYAB, ASC, AFMC, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio will manage this CRFI. Respondents may reply to this CRFI within 60 days of this notice to: Chief, EW Plans Office, 647th AESS/SYAB, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433.  Electronic responses may be sent to:  Wilke, Michael A CTR USAF AFMC 647 AESS/SYAB [Michael.Wilke.ctr@wpafb.af.mil] or Quillin, Linda F Civ USAF AFMC 647 AESS/SYAB [Linda.Quillin@wpafb.af.mil].
 To further define CRFI information needs, an exchange of information between industry and government may be achieved by an industry day and/or one-on-one meetings with respondents to clarify the intent and resolve concerns.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond.  All responses submitted will be reviewed and assessed.  All submissions properly marked will be considered proprietary and treated in accordance with their markings.

GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>Components to be  integrated into the servers.

GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>Components to be  integrated into the servers.

<DESC>POSTED APRIL 21, 2009: AMENDMENT 0001
The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate changes to Section L.   
PLEASE NOTE: Section L5 remains unchanged, with the time and date for proposal receipt no later than 2pm, May 1, 2009.
POSTED APRIL 1, 2009: The files comprising the SIR are contained in the attached zip file. Go to URL http://www.faa.gov/help/zip_files for assistance in opening the zip file. 
In addition, attached are questions received from industry and FAA responses regarding the Aviation Liability Insurance Brokerage Services Program. The FAA has National contracts for providing air traffic control services at visual flight rules (VFR) control towers. This program is referred to as the Federal Aviation Administration Contract Tower (FCT) program. Acknowledging the devastating effects associated with an aircraft accident, there is a need for the FAA to provide aircraft accident liability insurance coverage at each of the FCT locations. The FAA has established a $10,000,000.00 per occurrence amount for each of the approximately 240 FCT locations. This SIR will procure the brokerage services necessary to obtain the aviation liability insurance. 
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (May 1, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the Business Declaration Form included in the SIR. 
Proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. EST, Friday, May 1, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

<DESC>Amendment A003 issued 4/21/09 to extend the proposal date indefinitely.  A future amendment will be issued to establish a new proposal date.
FYI: In accordance with the Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 1.1.2 The FAA has been relieved from the requirements of the Brooks Act.  Therefore, we are allowed to request pricing information prior to the technical "down-select". (Added 4/14/09)
Amendment A002 issued 4/6/09 to add CLINs for Overtime for Non-exempt Personnel.
Amendment A001 issued to correct the clause reference in the Travel and Subsistence CLINs to H.8, rather than H.12.
The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)
It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $200,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
This requirement is available for full-and-open competition.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
The A&E firm's submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 
1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence-Offeror shall submit examples (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities utilized in each of the following areas: (i) environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit, (ii) pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects), (iii) environmental management system implementation (can include ISO 14001 implementation), and (iv) environmental remedial investigation and design (CERCLA) performed within the last ten (10) years.  These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort, their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables.)  Projects completed for the Federal Government, in particular, should be included, if any.
2. Past Performance-For each of the examples presented in response to Factor 1 above, offerors shall provide information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders.
3. Professional Qualifications Necessary for Satisfactory Performance of Required Services-Offeror shall submit a complete rsum of the experience of each executive/supervisor and technical staff member presently employed by the company who will be devoting all, or a majority of, their time to this contract.  Rsums should include:  name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Rsums of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is required.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty (30) days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.  Offeror shall provide documentation as to laboratory capability for one or more primary laboratories and one or more quality assu7rance laboratories.  Documentation should be sufficient to indicate that laboratory capabilities in such areas as analytical methodology, quality assurance and reporting are equivalent to those required of laboratories participating in the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP.)  Evidence of current participation, as a CLP laboratory, will be sufficient to meet this requirement.
4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time-Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload; i.e. total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, examples of completed projects and time tables associated with their completion should be provided.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.
5. Geographic Location-The offeror's geographic location relative to the Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, will be evaluated in this element, with higher scores given to those firms closest to the Aeronautical Center.
6. Minority and Women Employment-The percentage of minority employees in all job classifications and pay scales, noting the percentage of minorities in the immediate locality and general surrounding area, and the number of women in all job classifications and pay scales, will be evaluated.
Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.  
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (April 23, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Contracting Specialist, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This project involves the construction of stream improvement features over approximately 2 miles of Red River.  The work includes instream habitat structure installation, channel relocation, earthwork, and revegetation.  Revegetation will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.  This project is located approximately 55 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction of Red River Road (NFS road 222) then proceeding approximately 10 miles on the Red River Road. The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho.  Price estimate for the total project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  A formal pre-bid tour was held in the Fall of 2007.  The only significant change made since this time is the source location of the trees for the instream structures.  They will be harvested from a unit source located in Deadwood Creek.  No formal pre-bid tour is planned at this time.  Contractors interested in visiting the site may call Karen Ruklic at 208-983-5144 for assistance.  Site photos are also available upon request.  The solicitation was issued 3/25/09.  Responses are due 4/27/09.  Bid bonds are required.  Faxed offers will not be accepted.  Amendment was made to solicitation on 4/17/09 to correct minor discrepancies in Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 in Section B -1, Schedules of Items and to make a change in the straw mulch requirements.  Solicitation response date was not extended.  Offerors must acknowledge amendment and should submit prices on amended Schedules.  Solicitation was amended a second time on 4/21/09 to add specifications regarding turbidity mitigation requirements, make a minor change to Schedule 1 in Section B-1 Schedules of Items, and extend solicitation response date to 5/1/09 at 4:00 PM.  No new Schedule of Item was issued.  Offerors must acknowledge amendment on offer.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with PerkinElmer LAS, Inc., 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT 06484-4794.  The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires a LCI Volocity Basic Controller Kit, Volocity Quantitation (add’l License), Volocity Acquisition (add’l License), Upgrade Volocity Vis to Current Version (add), Volocity FRAP plugin upgrade kit, LCI XY Upgrade Kit Nikon TE2000, and Prior Piezo Z Upgrade Kit 250um + holders.  Upgrades will be compatible with existing Perkin Elmer UltraVIEW Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope.  
Digital image analysis has become increasingly important with the use of microscopy, and the technology opens new worlds for understanding the images created under a microscope. Perkin Elmer, Inc. offers products that emphasize different microscopic applications. Volocity, created and developed by Improvision, a division of Perkin Elmer, is a set of four products designed for three- and four-dimensional image acquisition, volume visualization, object tracking, charting, image restoration, and publication. 
The appropriate statutory authority is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i).  The cited authority is applicable because PerkinElmer is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  An award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed-price, four-year (FY2010 through FY2013) production contract to Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS) for the AN/ARC-210 family of Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment requirements for domestic and foreign military sales (FMS).  The procurement requirements include up to approximately 4000 AN/ARC-210 family of EP radios consisting of the RT-1556B, RT-1747D, RT-1824(C), RT-1794(C), RT-1851(C), RT-1851A(C), and FMS variants, inclusive of options and associated equipment; a Standard Commercial Warranty, support equipment; engineering technical support; integrated logistics support; spare and repair parts; and associated data.  The RT-1556B configuration functional capabilities include simplex two-way communication of normal and secure voice amplitude modulated (AM) or frequency modulated (FM) signals in the 30.000 MHz to 400 MHz radio frequency (RF) bands.  The RT-1556B also provides the following modes of operation: a dedicated guard receiver which can provide continuous monitoring of the guard frequency in UHF/VHF bands of 243.000 MHz or 121.500 MHz, a receive-only mode of operation in normal and secure voice from 108.000 through 117.9975 MHz (AM), a maritime mode of operation in the 156.000 MHz through 162.025 MHz frequency band, and variable AM and FM electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) mode(s), these being HAVEQUICK, HAVEQUICK II, and SINCGARS.  The RT-1556B utilizes several types of data buses to convey control and status information among the various WRAs making up the system.  These include the MIL-STD-1553B AVMUX Bus, the Remote Control Data Bus, the Antenna and Filter Data Bus, and the DS-101 Data Loading Bus.  The RT-1556B provides 8.33 kHz channel spacing capability for compatibility with EuroCae (ED-23B), and is software loadable using Advanced Memory Loader Verifier (AMLV).  The RT-1747D has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus an added 70 MHz half-duplex converter and the software needed to select half-duplex channels, including SATCOM channels, and operates in the 70 MHz half-duplex mode for UHF beyond line of sight operation.  The RT-1794(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus added capabilities including embedded COMSEC, embedded DAMA for UHF SATCOM, Link 4/4A/11/Aircraft Carrier Landing System (ACLS), MIL-STD-188-220A protocol implementing Variable Message Format, and DS-101 COMSEC keyfill capability.  The RT-1824(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1794(C).  The RT-1824(C) provides hardware compatibility for future DAMA A SATCOM interoperability, a plain text data mode, and enhanced VMF message processing.  The RT-1851(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1824(C), and incorporates an embedded FM Immunity filter and upgraded processors, allowing for software upgrades to add Bandwidth Efficient Advanced Modulation (BEAM), a waveform compression algorithm providing 80 kb/s in a 25kHz SatCom channel and 80 kb/s in a 25kHz LOS channel.  The RT-1851A(C) extends the frequency range to 512MHz to provide interoperability with land-based civil agencies.  The FY08 through FY10 procurement will be supported by an organizational to commercial depot maintenance strategy.

<a href="mailto:BRUNSMAN.ANDREA@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 921190   The following questions have been received in response to this Notice of Intent:
Q1) Is the government paying Arlington County a fixed amount or on a per passenger basis? A1) A fixed amount. Q2) Am I correct to assume that this is a Monday through Friday operation?A2) Correct, this is only available Monday through Friday. Q3) When is this service scheduled to start?A3) This service is for the follow-on to a current contract, the new service starts May 8, 2009. Q4) Is the schedule frequency based on bus size or departmental policy?A4) EPA's core business hours are 9AM - 3PM (meaing EPA employees have to start by 9 AM and cannot leave earlier than 3 PM), the peak hours fall in line with when most EPA employees are arriving or departing from work and therefore, when the highest volume of passengers will be.
These services fall in line with the memo that President Bush signed for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on September 26, 2005. In his memo, President Bush requested that Agencies review their existing operating and administrative processes and conservation programs and identify and implement ways to reduce overall fuel use. Eliminating the EPA shuttle bus route and using already available Metro bus service, clearly supports the initiative. It eliminates a duplicative EPA shuttle bus schedule, encourages the use of mass transportation by EPA employees both for commuting and for official business purposes, will result in  long-term savings to the Agency for shuttle buses, fuel, maintenance, and drives, and will reduce overall fuel consumption in the DC area as well as emissions.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement which, if the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Andrea Brunsman via e-mail at  brunsman.andrea@epa.gov.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region, Public Buildings Service, Project Management Division is pleased to announce an opportunity for the construction of new offices for the Clerk of Courts of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the construction of new judicial chambers for the U.S. District Court within the historic Jose V. Toledo U.S. Courthouse located at Recinto Sur and Tanca Streets in San Juan, Puerto Rico.. The work includes selective demolition, closure of existing floor openings, installation of exterior windows and tenant fit-out. Construction Magnitude: Between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.0

The 103,933 square foot Jose V. Toledo U.S. Courthouse is an historic structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the U.S. District Court and a number of executive agencies. Originally construction as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1914, the building was enlarged in 1940. The earlier three story portion of the courthouse was designed in Spanish Colonial style between 1906 and 1908, by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury. When completed, it was the first significant federal building in Puerto Rico. The later six-story Art Moderne addition was designed by the Department of Treasury’s Public Buildings Branch. The entire building was extensively renovated in 1999.

Pre-Construction/walk through will be held  on April 30 2009 at 10 a.m. at the Jose V. Toledo U.S. Courthouse located on Recinto Sur and Tanca Streets in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The meeting will be held in Courtroom # 2.

<a href="mailto:nathan.c.jordan@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>PM-SOF Survival, Support and Equipment Systems will be hosting an industry information day at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA on Thursday the 7th of May 2009.  The topic of discussion will be the development of a capability or capabilities to determine if Special Operations Personnel Advanced Equipment Requirements (SPEAR) Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS) soft armor inserts have been compromised leading to degraded ballistic protection performance.  The discussions will begin with a PM-SSES personnel brief on the requirements and detailed information on the desired capability.  This will be followed by an open industry question and answer session. [Background] United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) soft armor ballistic inserts serve as a vital component of the SPEAR ballistic protection system.  A mechanism does not currently exist to non-destructively evaluate the risk to performance through internal degrad  ation of these vital pieces of equipment other than visual inspection (e.g. cuts, tears in the cover).  Once an item is issued to the SOF user community, confidence in its ability to perform as designed may decline depending on operational use and environment.  PM-SSES has determined that there is a need to develop a means of non-destructively evaluating soft armor to ensure that the users are fully protected.  Some of the more common issues associated with a decrease in ballistic performance in soft armor are moisture/water contamination (through a perforation in the water proof barrier) and limited field life due to extreme environmental exposure. As well, the legacy labeling on soft armor is extremely degraded during its lifecycle making it impossible to outline the initial date of issue or manufacture. [Desired Technology] PM-SSES will be utilizing the BAA process to execute a review of any developmental technologies and capabilities that may, through further development  , act as a possible technology insertion into the current soft armor program to quickly and effectively determine if they have been compromised. The desired technology must meet the interoperability need and be easily incorporated into the current SPEAR BALCS soft armor system.  Additionally, the soft armor insert (with the identified technology insertion) must be able to meet all of the SPEAR BALCS soft armor performance requirements to include (but not limited to); ballistics testing, weight, environmental conditioning.  Following the industry day, we will be soliciting for white papers from industry leaders from a wide variety of industries e.g. textiles, colors and dyes, sensors, etc.  Vendors will have thirty (30) days to submit white papers for review to the outlined point of contact within the Natick Acquisition Center for consideration under the Broad Agency Announcement process. PLEASE NOTE NEW RESPONSE DATE OF 5 MAY 2009.  Please send all responses to Mr. Jason Kruise at Jason.Kruise@us.army.mil

The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY:  Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the fall of 2008.
