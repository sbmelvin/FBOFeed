<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Creative Office Environments, Chesapeake, VA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the US Army Corp of Engineers Norfolk District.  The US Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) Norfolk District has a need to procure 18 Room Wizards.  The USAEC currently has Steelcase work stations and the Room Wizard from PolyVision (a member of the Steelcase Design Partnership) has been designed to work specifically with the Stealcase workstations.  The Room Wizard can be integrated directly with the workstations to provide multimedia information and the ability to collaborate and communicate visually.  This will enhance the usefulness of the workstations.  The Room Wizard also works with Lotus Notes? and Microsoft Outlook? to provide better scheduling.  Creative Office Environments is a small business and an authorized PolyVision dealer.  Through the use of market research including literature review, internal searches, and expert knowledge from Jerry Taylor Interior Designer, USACE Norfolk District, it has been determined that the equipment required by USACE is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements.  Thorough market surveys indicate that the Room Wizard is the only system that provides multimedia information and the ability to collaborate and communicate visually while integrating with the existing workstations.  Award to another vendor would result in a modification of existing equipment to accommodate another vendor's system.  This would result in a substantial duplication of cost that the government is not expected to recover through an open competition. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST January 5, 2005 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Susan Lawson, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Susan Lawson at Susan.Lawson@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>The purpose of the Tax Improvement Project (TIP) Program is to provide technical assistance to the State Tax Service (STS) of the Republic of Armenia, to reform further the tax administration systems and tax policies, thereby raising substantially the tax/GDP ratio in the near future. The TIP project will continue to provide technical assistance, training, and capacity building for the State Tax Service and bring greater transparency to the operations of the tax service. While the project’s main focus is on administrative changes, tax policy related technical assistance is also envisioned, in order to modify and simplify those policies that hinder the expansion of the tax base and more efficient collections.  
USAID plans to award a five year (3 years base period and 2 years option period) cost plus fixed fee contract with a total estimated cost in the range of $15-16 million for the implementation of this activity.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) will support a 5 year extension for a longitudinal study entitled “Gene-Finding and Longitudinal Studies for Age-Associated Conditions in a Sardinian Population Cohort (Sardinia2).  Sardinia2 is an extension of the current contract N01-AG-1-2109 with Consiglion Nazionale delle Ricerche, Cagliari, ITALY.  The primary objective of Sardinia2 is to extend the studies of aging-associated conditions in the especially favorable Sardinian population with longitudinal and further genetic tests to assess both the prognostic value of trait values singly and in combination, and to move toward the identification of alleles that confer significant risk for extreme values of individual traits of interest.  This scientific research service is for the Consiglion Nazionale delle Ricerche and available from only one responsible source.  The period of performance for Sardinia2 is planned to begin on June 14, 2006 and end on June 15, 2011. The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) 1 as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  If, however, there are any responsible sources who feel they possess the abilities which would enable them to perform this project, they may submit a proposal which will be considered by NIH.

B. Full text of announcement
I. Funding Opportunity Description 

1.	INTRODUCTION
The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA/IPTO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA to perform research and development to support the Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA) program. The main goal of the program is to develop and evaluate psychologically-based and neurobiologically-based theories, design principles, and architectures of human cognition. In a subsequent phase, the program has the ultimate goal of implementing and evaluating computational models of human cognition that could eventually be used to simulate human behavior and approach human cognitive performance in a wide range of situations.

1.1	PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
Phase 1 of this program is divided into three parallel thrusts. Thrust A seeks to make dramatic advances in the breadth and performance of cognitive models based primarily on modeling the functional psychological components of cognition. Thrust B seeks to develop neurobiologically-inspired theories, designs, and resulting architecture(s). Thrust C seeks development of a framework evaluating implementations of the cognitive architectures created in Thrusts A and B. Each of these thrusts is discussed in Section 2, below. Potential bidders are encouraged to review the BAA’s Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for further detail. See section IV-6.

1.2 	PROGRAM SCOPE 
This program consists of 2 phases. This BAA is for Phase 1 only, which will span 13 months. Within each Phase 1 thrust, we anticipate three sequential tasks: (1) Theory Development, (2) Technical Exchange, and (3) Architecture Development. The first task will have a duration of six months. The second task – a series of technical exchange meetings common to all thrusts – will span a period of about one month. The third task within each thrust will have a duration of six months. 

2.	TECHNICAL APPROACH
It is the goal of Thrust A to design computational models of human cognition by modeling functions of the human mind such as (1) perception and attention, (2) learning and memory, and (3) decision making and problem solving. DARPA is seeking cognitive models that result in human-like behavior on real world problems that are not merely “toy” problems. In Thrust B, DARPA seeks a dramatic improvement in our understanding of the brain’s functions and processes. Initially, we seek a major leap in the performance of traditional AI systems by augmenting and informing their designs with neuroscience principles. We expect to develop a global theory of cognition and one or more neurobiologically-inspired, integrated cognitive architectures. DARPA is seeking the development of an evaluation framework, Thrust C, for the cognitive architectures developed under Thrusts A and B. Two test batteries will be developed: a suite of tests of individual cognitive functions and a set of challenge problems that require the integrated use of multiple cognitive functions.

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications.

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary. Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors. If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1. Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Section II, I. of the proposal, organized by task and year. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. 
2. Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1. Address to Request Application Package

This announcement contains all information required to submit a proposal. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. [Note: see paragraph 6, “other submission requirements,” for reference to the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).]

2. Content and Form of Application Submission
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission. This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL:
http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-18

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page. Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy. The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal. If a proposer intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet. Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA. 
REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report. These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW). Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).
PROPOSAL FORMAT
Proposers must submit an original and 2 hard copies (3 total) and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the abstract or full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd). Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-18, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  

3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) March 1, 2005, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase. However, BAA 05-18, Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA) will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) January 17, 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through January 17, 2006. While the proposals submitted after the March 1, 2005 deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule. DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.
4. Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5. Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6. Other Submission Requirements
Proposers must obtain the BAA 05-18 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats. The PIP will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-18 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information

1. Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts, technical claims, and applicability to follow-on work including Phase 2 of the program.  
 (2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Offerors should apply new and/or existing technology in an innovative way that supports the objectives of the proposed effort.   The proposed concepts and systems should show breadth of innovation across all the dimensions of the proposed solution.  Offerors must also specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics for measuring progress of the effort.
 (3)	Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission:  The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to DARPA/IPTO.  
(4)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.
(5)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition: The offeror should provide a clear strategy and plan for transition to Phase 2 of program. Offerors should also provide a plan for transition of appropriate technology components and information to the user community.
(6)	Cost Realism:  The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.
2. Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals. Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors. These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).

VI. Award Information Administration

1. Award Notices

Principal Investigators will receive a letter informing them of the disposition of their proposal via U.S. mail. 

2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Proposers may wish to visit DARPA’s Contracts Management Office (CMO) website (http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/modelgrantagreement.htm) for model grant and cooperative agreement terms and conditions.

<DESC>Description: The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to stabilize the sea coastal borders of two closed landfills.  The work includes, but is not limited to:  Repair of approximately 1200 meters of coastal shoreline to prevent erosion and improve aesthetic appearance.  The work includes excavation and inspection for contamination of approximately 25,000 cubic meters of excess soil from the seafloor and beachfront; installation of approximately 32,000 square meters geotextile fabric with estimated 120,000 cubic meters basaltic rock coverage which the contractor will be required to blast, crush and transport from a nearby quarry; and some leveling and earthwork to the landfills themselves.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The project is divided into three separate and distinct phases of work.  Each phase will be listed as a separate contract line item (CLIN) on a lump-sum basis under a Firm, Fixed-Price contract.  The first phase will be awarded for performance this year.  Phases (CLINs) 2 and 3 will start in 2006 and 2007 respectively.  The government currently entends to fund only the basic phase at time of award.  The anticipated performance period for each phase is 365 days which includes a winter exclusionary period of 245 days from 15 September through 15 May wherein no work will be required.  Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.  It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 1 Feb 2005 with offers due 30 days thereafter.  Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted.  This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4)—International Agreement, to only US and Danish firms.  Although no hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed, those firms interested in receiving a CD ROM version may request such by writing to: Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, PSC 73, APO AE 09716 or Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, U.S. Embassy, Dag Hammarskjolds Alle 24, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.  Requests should reference Request for Proposal (RFP) No. FA2523-05-R-0003 and contain name; address; telephone number; facsimile number; e-mail address; point of contact; and DUNS number.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted, but faxed or e-mailed requests are allowed.  Our fax number is (country code 45) 3526-5108.

<DESC>The West Campus of St Elizabeths, a former mental health facility, consists of 182 acres and 61 buildings constructed between the 1850s and the 1960s. The buildings contain approximately 1.1 million gross square feet of space. The entire site, including the brick wall running along Martin Luther King Jr. Ave, is a National Historic Landmark. Another feature of the West Campus is a Civil War graveyard on the western slope overlooking Bolling Air Force Base. From 1953 to December 2004, St. Elizabeths was controlled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On October 1, 1987 HHS gave the District of Columbia a license to operate and maintain several buildings on the West Campus. DC terminated this agreement in 2004, in anticipation of the transfer of the property to GSA from HHS. The structures and grounds of the West Campus are generally in a deteriorated condition.  The East Campus of St. Elizabeths is excluded from this Request for Proposals (RFP). It is intended that the West Campus will remain in Federal ownership and will be redeveloped as either a multi- or single-tenanted, high security campus for Federal agency tenants. To fully understand the maximum development potential of St. Elizabeths – West Campus, GSA seeks a qualified contractor (Contractor) to complete a Land Use Feasibility Analysis and Campus Master Plan to house federal agency tenants. Contractor will also provide all necessary services to ensure GSA’s compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). Services shall commence on or about April 1, 2005, and continue through September 30, 2006.  The government intends to award one firm fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation.  Source selection procedures will be used (see FAR 15.3).  The government reserves the right to award without discussions so offerors should not expect to have an opportunity to correct deficiencies in their offers.  The evaluation factors for award include:  Past Experience, Work Statement, Project Schedule, Subcontracting Plan and Cost.  Copies of the solicitation will be available on or about January 19, 2005.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for January 25, 2005.  Additional details on this conference will be provided in the solicitation.  GSA is issuing this solicitation electronically only.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.eps.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institutes’ Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a new innovative requirement to develop and implement a centralized model of Internal Review Board (IRB) review for multi-site NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The goal of the Initiative is two-fold: 1) To decrease the duplicative burden of protocol review that currently occurs at hundreds of local IRBs nationwide on NCI- sponsored multicenter trials by providing a single, centralized review that can be utilized by local IRBs participating in these trials, and 2) to maintain, and in some aspects enhance, high standards for the protection of research participants by providing consistent, expert IRB review at the national level. 

Currently, the Initiative involves one central IRB that reviews all adult Cooperative Group Phase 3 treatment trials and more than 170 participating local IRBs who use the CIRB review materials to conduct their own facilitated review. Under the facilitated review mechanism, the local IRB no longer needs to conduct a full Board review in order to approve a protocol; instead, the local IRB chair or subcommittee reviews all the CIRB documents for any local concerns and accepts or rejects the CIRB review. The local facilitated review process can take hours or days instead of weeks. 

The CIRB has been providing reviews for adult Cooperative Group trials since January 2001.  In the summer of 2004, NCI established a pediatric CIRB to review all COG phase 2, 3 and pilot protocols. The pediatric CIRB will begin reviewing protocols by Fall 2004. It will utilize the same infrastructure that has been developed for the adult CIRB.  The CIRB Initiative has the potential to serve the nearly 2,000 sites that conduct Cooperative Group trials.

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following: 1) Manage and provide administrative/regulatory support for two Central IRBs, one for adult trials and one for pediatric trials; 2) Manage and support current and newly enrolled participating local sites; 3) Conduct the recruitment and integration of new sites into the Initiative; 4) Provide informatics support and system integration; 5) Support NCI’s internal and external communications efforts regarding all aspects of the Initiative; 6) Implement and manage an Initiative-wide Quality Improvement Plan; 7) Provide support for the formal accreditation of both CIRBs in contract year 2 or 3, as determined by NCI; 8) Develop and implement a system for utilizing central review for sites that do not have a local IRB; 9) Establish and support a second Board for adult trials if it is needed to handle the growth in the menu of Phase 2 protocols.

This is a new requirement and the Government anticipates 1 (one) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of three years with incentive options for three additional years. RFP-N02-CB-57006-48 will issued on or about January 28, 2005.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/).  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No Collect Calls accepted.

<DESC>1.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI5026).  This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-27.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure maintenance services for the terrazzo marble floor in our Bldg. 40 facility, which is located on the National Institutes of Health campus.  This service will be required on a monthly basis. This service is being procured on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition procedures, with the Stuart Dean Company.  Stuart Dean is an accredited founding member of the Marble Institute of America (MIA) and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation (IASRAC).  Their processes and proprietary methods are accepted by the above, routinely outperform the competition and are of higher quality and achieve longer lasting results. Stuart Dean is also a participatory member of the American Society of Testing Materials and is asked to test products and systems for the regulatory body. Stuart Dean is a National Associate Member of BOMA (Building Owners and Managers Association) International. They have provided maintenance in Bldg. 40 facility for the past 3 years. This is not a small business Set-Aside. The requirement consists of the following: 1) monthly maintenance of over 4,200 square feet of terrazzo marble in 1st floor public area; 2) elevator lobby; 3) steps leading to North rotunda entrance; 4) landing at base of stairs; 5) areas to be refinished will be completely masked and covered with protective paper and plastic to ensure integrity of delicate finishes adjacent to marble, such as bronze and wood; 6) all light to medium scratches will be removed using abrasive means including resin-bonded diamond pads and sand screens in conjunction with a weighted floor machine; 7) a powdered mixture of oxalic acid, aluminum oxide and water will be used as a polishing compound under a 19” natural fiber-polishing pad; 8) once even polished is achieved, all polishing slurry will be removed by use of a water vacuum, followed by a two-step neutralizing process achieved by flooding the polished area with ph balanced stone soap;  9) vitrification or crystallization of marble will be performed to improve the floors, slip co-efficient and enhance the hardness of shine, per manufacturer’s specifications utilizing specially low-rotation floor machine and #2 Texsteel steel wool pads. The scope of the work is to restore the luster and sheen of the floor material by adherence to methodology developed by the Marble Institute of America and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation.  Workers skilled in vitrification process are a mandatory requirement. Depending on the extent of the wear, the requirements might include polishing with abrasive compounds and vitrification of the surface.  It is critical that the  thickness of the marble be minimized as the marble is ground during the polishing process. The marble is only a fraction of an inch thick, and serious repercussions could arise regarding the longevity of the floor.  It is critical that only an experienced, high-quality firm perform this work. The Period of Performance will be January 2005 – December 2005. The North American Industry Classification System Code Number 561720 and the Small Business Set-Aside is 14.0 million. The FOB Point shall be Destination.  This will be a firm-fixed price contract. The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items;  and FAR 52.406-7 Central Contractor Registration (2003). A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included.  (B) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. The CCR website is http://www.ccr.dlis.dlaimil. Copies of the aforementioned clauses are available upon request by telephone to Carol Griffith at (301) 402-2282.

GENERAL
     This Section includes surface preparation, field cleaning and sealing of exposed exterior building surfaces.  

INTRODUCTION
Many of the problems of brick masonry, brought to the attention of the Brick Institute of America over the past years, have resulted from improper cleaning methods. Some walls have been irreparably damaged as a result of a lack of attention to cleaning details and procedures.
Cleaning failures generally fall into one of three categories: 
1. Failure to thoroughly saturate the brick masonry surface with water before and after application of chemical or detergent cleaning solutions. Dry masonry permits absorption of the cleaning solution and may result in "mortar smear", "white scum", or the development of efflorescence or "green stain". Saturation of the surface prior to cleaning reduces the absorption rate, permitting the cleaning solution to stay on the surface rather than be absorbed.
2. Failure to properly use chemical cleaning solutions. Improperly mixed or overly concentrated acid solutions can etch or wash out cementitious materials from the mortar joints. They have a tendency to discolor masonry units, particularly lighter shades, producing an appearance frequently termed "acid burn" and can also promote the development of "green" and "brown" stains. 
3. Failure to protect windows, doors, and trim. Many cleaning agents, particularly acid solutions, have a corrosive effect on metal. If permitted to come in contact with metal frames, the solutions may cause pitting of the metal or staining of the masonry surface and trim materials, such as limestone and cast stone.
Before the actual cleaning of a project begins, all cleaning procedures and solutions should be applied to a sample test area of approximately 20 sq. ft. (1.9 m2). The effectiveness of the cleaning agent should be judged by inspection of the sample test area after a period of not less than one week after application. The size of the test area may be larger, depending upon the cleaning procedure. The indiscriminate use of muriatic acid or the wrong proprietary compound can cause unsightly, difficult-to-remove stains. Reactions of brick and cleaning solutions are not always predictable and thus it is safer to use a trial-and-error method on a small test area before committing the entire project to a set procedure. Minute quantities of certain minerals found in some fired clay masonry units and materials, such as manganese, added to color brick may react with some solutions and cause staining. Sample testing should be performed under conditions of temperature and humidity that will closely approximate the conditions under which the brickwork will be cleaned. Chemical cleaning solutions are generally more effective when the outdoor temperature is 50 oF (10 oC) or above. 
Pressurized Water Cleaning
To cut labor costs, many cleaning contractors utilize pressurized water. Some pressure systems feature a pressure gun and nozzle equipped with a control switch. This setup permits the operator to apply solutions to a wall over 100 ft. (30.5 m) from the base unit. Other systems have two separate hoses - one with plain water and the other with a cleaning solution. Low pressure has been defined as 100 to 300 psi (700 to 2100 kPa), medium pressure as 300 to 700 psi (2100 to 4850 kPa) and high pressure as 700 psi (4850 kPa) or greater. A sand finish or a surface coating may be removed by pressurized water cleaning, resulting in a different appearance. Nozzle pressure in excess of 700 psi (4850 kPa) may damage brick units and erode mortar joints.
The following procedure is suggested:
1. Select and test the cleaning solution on a sample area. Check the equipment for cleaning solution compatibility. For proprietary compounds, mix in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Presoak wall.
3. Protect metal, glass, wood, limestone and cast stone surfaces. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions.
4. Presoak or saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water, from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below should also be saturated in order to prevent absorption of the run-off from above
5. Application of cleaning solutions may be by a low pressure sprayer, 30 to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa), or through the high pressure cleaning unit.
6. Permit the cleaning solution to remain on the wall for approximately 5 minutes.
7. Starting at the top, flush the wall down, as in the previous procedure.
Caution: It is possible for solutions to be driven into the masonry when applied under high pressure, and become the source of future staining. However, if the walls are sufficiently saturated with water before the solutions are applied, the risk of penetration is reduced. Experience has shown that this cleaning method has a high probability of changing the appearance of sand molded brick, sand- faced extruded brick, and brick with glazed coatings or slurries applied to the finished faces. The brick manufacturer should be consulted on the use of high pressure water cleaning of such brick.


SURFACE PREPARATION
 
********************************
Specifier Notes: Describe surface preparation of substrates required before application of water repellents.
********************************
 
A. Clean all dirt, oil, grease, mold, mildew, efflorescence, or any other coating or material from surfaces that interfere with penetration, performance, adhesion, or aesthetics of water repellents. Rinse thoroughly, using pressure water spray to remove cleaner residues. Allow surfaces to dry completely before application of water repellents.
 
B. Repair, patch, and fill all cracks, voids, defects, and damaged areas in surface as approved by the COR. Allow repair materials to cure completely before application of water repellents.
 C. Seal all open joints.
 D. Allow new masonry and concrete repairs and repointed surfaces to cure before application of water repellents

WATER REPELLENTS
. This specification covers preparation, materials, services, and equipment required for the application of Water Sealant products for projects involving either old or new construction.  Any substantial deviations shall be referred to the manufacturer or authorized representative. Product is manufactured in three strengths, which vary in solids content.  The determination of which formulation is appropriate is dependent upon the porosity of the substrate. Surface type may be concrete, brick, block, stone, stucco, wood and other porous building materials, which allow penetration of the sealant.

A. Surface Preparation: Contractor or Applicator shall be responsible for providing a clean, dry substrate free from oil, dirt, grease, efflorescence or any other coating which may inhibit penetration and adhesion of water repellent.  This requirement applies to new construction, renovation or remedial projects. Substrate must be completely dry prior to applying product.
B.  Environmental Requirements:
1. Temperature: Product may be applied at any temperature providing that there is no frozen moisture present in the substrate.  When applied at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit the product may cure at a slower rate. Optimal temperatures should be above 40„a F (5„a C) or below 95„a F (35„a C).
2. Do not apply material if the substrate is wet or contains frozen moisture. Allow substrate to dry for a minimum of 48 hours after rain or power washing.
3. Do not apply material during inclement weather or if precipitation is expected within 12 hours.
4. Do not use spray methods of application under windy conditions.
 
C.     Protection:
1. Special precautions should be taken to avoid fumes from entering the building being treated. Ventilation systems and fresh air intakes should be turned off and covered.
2. Protect shrubs, metal, glass, vehicles, and other building hardware from overspray.

TEST PANELS
 
A. Before full-scale application, review manufacturer¡¦s product data sheets to determine the suitability of each product for the specific surfaces.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the continued services of Mr. Harold Beck, New York, NY 10014 for the analysis of databases on radioactive fallout, dose estimation and development of dosimetry methodology for a base year with two one year options.  The REB has been involved for a number of years in the assessment of doses resulting from radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons tests. Some of those studies have been completed, others are near completion, and several are in progress.  Because of these studies, the REB has become an important source of information on the doses received from fallout and the repository of several databases related to fallout. In view of the continuing interest of the public in the assessment of the radiation doses and risks resulting from exposures to radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons tests, it is important to complete the studies that have been undertaken and to make their results available to the public and to the scientific community in a timely manner.  Mr. Beck will provide expertise and input in the development, conduct, and review of studies related to the estimation of doses from radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons tests, to include: 1) the analysis of databases on fallout that were recently prepared at REB in electronic form; 2) the improvement of the estimation of doses received by the populations that resided in the vicinity of nuclear weapons test sites; 3) the development of a joint American/Russian dosimetry methodology, and 4) the extension of the web-based Iodine-131 thyroid dose calculator to other radionuclides. Mr. Beck who is a world-renowned expert on the determination of radioactive fallout deposited on the ground and on the subsequent radiation exposures to humans, worked for more than 30 years at the Environmental Measurements Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy.  That laboratory, previously called the Health and Safety Laboratory, was the leading scientific organization in the world in the area of research on the ground deposition, environmental behavior, and related dose assessment from radionuclides produced by nuclear weapons tests.  Mr. Beck participated in campaigns of measurement of fallout near the Nevada Test Site and in the Marshall Islands; he is also one of the main scientists involved in the different studies of dose reconstruction related to fallout that have been completed or undertaken in the past ten years. Because of his long time research in these areas, Mr. Beck is uniquely qualified to assist NCI in the assessment of fallout-related exposure at any geographic site, in particular, at those that are subject of present NCI research (Nevada, Semipalatinsk, Marshall Islands).  These services are the continuation of on going studies and Mr. Beck has been collaborating with NCI on fallout dose assessments in related projects which are being continued and elaborated upon.  Mr. Beck is the only known source to the NCI researchers with the knowledge and expertise who can meet his needs.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researchers to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on January 28, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>I.	INTRODUCTION
Bechtel, BWXT Idaho LLC (BBWI), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory [as of February 1, 2005 the INEEL will become the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) operated by Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA)], is requesting an EOI from prospective vendors to develop and demonstrate fabrication processes at industrial scale for producing Advanced Gas Reactor low enriched fuel kernels and coated particles.  This EOI serves as a method of screening potential vendors.

II.	BACKGROUND
The INL is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory with offices located in Idaho Falls, Idaho.  To support the Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel Development and Qualification Program, an industrial partner (NRC licensed) is needed to help re-establish the capability in the United States to produce high quality fuel for advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors at industrial scale.  The scope of work will include optimization of production-scale processes for UCO kernel and TRISO coated particle fabrication, use of these processes to manufacture natural and low enriched uranium fuel for process development studies and eventual qualification tests, characterization of the kernels and particles, and certification that the fuel products meet all specifications.  To support optimization of the production-scale fuel fabrication processes, smaller or pilot-scale equipment may be used for economy for some studies, followed by validation in the production-scale process.  The full-scale kernel production rate is estimated to be about 3 kg/day.  Also in support of process optimization, characterization of products beyond the requirements of the product specification is needed to provide a fundamental understanding of phenomena occurring during the fuel fabrication processes.          

III.	PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
Information is sought to identify prospective vendors with the following capabilities: 

1.	Capability to fabricate uranium oxycarbide (UCO) microspheres using a demonstrated internal gelation process with natural and low enriched uranium feedstocks.  The kernel fabrication process must have a throughput of at least 1 kg of kernels per day, but preferably 3 kg per day.   
2.	Capability to characterize the UCO kernels and certify composite kernel batches to kernel density, diameter, sphericity, uranium enrichment, composition (total uranium, O/U ratio, C/U ratio and impurities) specifications.  Characterization also includes phase identification, microstructure and specific surface area. 
3.	Capability to apply TRISO coatings to natural and low-enriched UCO kernels, in a coater capable of an initial charge of at least 3 kg UCO kernels and applying all coatings without interruption. 
4.	Capability to characterize coated particles and certify to specifications that include layer thicknesses, layer densities, pyrocarbon anisotropies, particle aspect ratio, the defect fraction for the SiC layer, defect fractions of missing buffer and missing OPyC layers, pyrocarbon and SiC microstructure, IPyC permeability, IPyC and OPyC crystalline size, and IPyC and OPyC surface connected porosity. 
5.	Capability to utilize statistical process control and statistical quality control to demonstrate control of process variabilities and product acceptance.
6.	Capability to handle and dispose of waste products from these fabrication processes and characterization activities.
7.	A validated quality assurance program that meets the requirements of ASME NQA-1 and an NRC license.
8.	Facilities and procedures to receive, handle, and ship natural and enriched uranium feedstock and products. 


IV.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
It is the intent of this EOI to identify candidate vendors who have previous experience in providing the required services.  Prospective vendors shall provide:

1.	A description of presently owned equipment and facilities that have been or could be used for UCO kernel fabrication and coating, including details of both kernel fabrication and coating processes.
2.	A summary of experience fabricating UO2 and UCO kernels and applying BISO and TRISO coatings. 
3.	Evidence of recent nuclear fuel manufacturing efforts to support a customer’s needs and evidence of applying statistical techniques in the fuel fabrication process.
4.	Resumes of key personnel who would be assigned to the project. 
5.	Evidence of NRC license (validated NQA-1 program).

Please provide your EOI submittal to Glenn Clemons – BBWI Subcontract Administrator, PO Box 1625, 2525 Fremont Ave., Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3865 by close-of business, January 28, 2005.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Mr. Clemons at (208) 526-5728 or email gc2@inel.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing (U.S. Mail or email).

  The three tables will include data pertaining to Workers’ Compensation, Table 9.B1.- Coverage, benefits, and costs from 1940-2003; Workers’ Compensation, Table 9.B2.- Benefits, by state: 1997-2003; and Workers Compensation, Table 9.B3.- Type of insurer and medical benefits, by state from 2003. The file will contain comprehensive estimates of workers’ compensation costs for each State by the type of insurer, including private insurance carriers, State funds, federal programs, and self-insurers. The file will also contain estimates of the number of workers covered by workers’ compensation, the size of the covered payroll, the cost per employee covered, the costs per $100 of covered payroll and the best available estimates of the number of workers receiving workers’ compensation benefits in each State and the District of Columbia.
  The program summary and program highlights will include updated  information to the Workers’ Compensation Program Summary and Program Highlights contained in the Annual Statistical Supplement, 2004 to the Social Security Bulletin that includes workers compensation data through 2002 based on data in the three tables with year 2003 data.  
  The research paper will be a paper based on data and program specifics through 2003.  The paper should be similar to that produced annually through 1995, versions of which may be used as guides.  The paper is intended for publication in the Social Security Bulletin and should cover the topics included in the last two published Bulletin articles.  These are: Workers’ Compensation: Coverage, Benefits, and Costs, 1990-91 published in the Fall 1993 edition and Workers’ Compensation: Coverage, Benefits, and Costs, 1992-93 published in Summer 1995.  These papers should include an overview of workers’ compensation program provisions and descriptions of recent changes.  The descriptive statistical tables and accompanying narrative material included information about coverage under workers’ compensation, types and amounts of benefit payments, information on types of insurers, employer costs and geographic variations.  The nature and content of the paper will be such that it can be updated annually, and will present similar content from year to year. No other source is known to SSA that is capable of providing the Workers’Compensation data that is complete, accurate and comprehensive. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. Interested parties that believe they can provide the required service must respond to this notice no later than 12:00 noon EST January 27, 2005.   Responses should be emailed to Michele.tubman@ssa.gov  no later than noon on 1/27/2005. FAXED RESPONSES WILL NOT BE PERMITTED. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not pay for any information submitted. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response hereto will not be honored or acknowledged.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>DONALD CROES, 732-532-3429
<DESC>W15P7T-05-R-S610 Synopsis dated 01-13-2005  The US Army Communications Electronic Command(CECOM) intends to request proposal for Product Manager Robotic & Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) requirement for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for a pplication as a multi-mission payload for the US Armys Extended Range/Multipurpose (ER/MP) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  This will be a best value, full and open competitive procurement based on banded operational requirements.  The contract will be for  the SDD Phase and contain one range quantity production option.  The contract will contain a mix of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) line items for SSD with the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) option being Firm Fixed Price.  The ac quisition will be a 24 month effort for delivery of 10 SDD units and their associated supportability to include:  logistics, qualifications testing and training.  The payload will be integrated and flight-tested in a contractor furnished test-bed aircraft prior to integration into the Army UAV system.  At the completion of an Operational Assessment and successful Milestone C decision, the variable quantity option for up to 10 units maybe exercised.  The Offerors will be required to establish Associated Cont ractor Agreements with the Armys ER/MP vendor.     The ER/MP UAV platform is a weapons-capable UAV primarily used in reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition (RSTA), and command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) roles in support of the corps/unit of employment (UE) and below.  The E R/MP EO/IR/LD payload will be one of three initial payloads, the other two being a Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) payload and a Warfighter Information Network  Tactical (WIN-T) communications payload (WCP).  Further inf ormation regarding the ER/MP system is available in the ER/MP system technical requirements document. While functioning on board the platform, the ER/MP EO/IR/LD payload will provide battlefield commanders with a day/night imaging sensor and laser designator for reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and target designation.  The pa yload must operate day and night, detect and recognize operationally-meaningful targets at survivable standoff ranges, determine range-to-target, autotrack and designate targets for precision-guided standoff weapons, provide target-location coordinates, an d display continuous high-resolution imagery to the battlefield commander.  The ability to provide such a capability to the supported commander will greatly increase battlefield effectiveness. The ER/MP EO/IR/LD payload shall have adequate on-board process ing to perform autotracking, designation, and to support the transmission of near-real-time motion imagery to the UAV ground control station (GCS) via the provided digital data link. Best Value criteria include meeting the objective capabilities that will be outlined in the RFP.  These include improved capability for the EO/IR/LD; a development path for reduced weight, volume and power and power requirements; improvements in target loc ation accuracy; and increased detection/recognition ranges.  It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or before 28 January 05, with contract award anticipated within the 3rd quarter of FY 05.

<DESC>UPDATE (1-13-05) THIRD AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 3.  The following is a summary of the major changes: 1)  Section K, AFMC 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV  1998), the following list of firms supplying non-government advisors was added  to the clause: Anteon International Corporation ARINC Incorporated Camber Corporation General Dynamics Corporation MTC Technologies Sumaria Systems, Inc. 2)  Several changes were made to Section L.  Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.   Offerors will be provided an approximate date for the beginning of their seat  evaluation via email once Volume II - Past Performance of their proposal is  received."   5)  The following passage was added to paragraph 2.1.5.4 (g), "This restriction  does not apply to PDF files submitted for the Pedigree documentation.  For the  Pedigree documentation, PDF files with textual search and copy functions shall  be submitted to the maximum extent practicable.  However, in situations where  submitting an "image" is the only option available, it is acceptable to do  so."   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP".

As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions of  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offeror’s proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.

This will enable the Government to provide  timely feedback regarding any questions about receipt of these questionnaires  and will help us to provide a tally of the received questionnaires.

In addition, answers to various questions and clarifications  have also been posted to clarify the changes found in the amendment and to  respond to questions or clarifications that did not result in a change to the  RFP.   An amendment changing the contract type from a "C" type contract to an "IDIQ"  type contract is still planned to be released in the near future.  Due to the  potential for inclement weather and various other factors, this amendment may  be released following the December 25th holiday rather than before.  For the  convenience of the offerors, this amendment will be a re-release of all  documents and will include all changes set forth in the first amendment as well  as those changes planned for the second amendment.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS BEING POSTED TO ALTER THE DELINEATED AREA OF SEARCH FOR THE LEASE ACQUISITION.

REQUIREMENT:
The U.S. Government is seeking to lease up to 10,300 rentable square feet of contiguous space containing approximately 2,000 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet of office and 8,000 square feet of climate controlled warehouse and related space in Atlanta, Georgia.  Contiguous (same floor) space is necessary.  Covered, secure overnight parking for 4 vehicles is required for large trucks and RV type vehicles, with a preference for these spaces to be reserved.   Additionally, 10 on-site spaces for daily parking is required with a preference for these parking spaces to be secure and reserved. 

LOCATION:
The U.S. Government will be evaluating offers from within the boundary of Interstate 285 in Atlanta, Georgia.  

A map of the delineated area is available upon request.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer industry questions regarding the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Synopsis Solicitation No. N68335-05-R-0021.

The following is provided for informational purposes.

1.	Industry Question:  “All proposals submitted under this announcement should be considered government property.”  Does this statement apply to the proposal and/or the concept study?  (If awarded?)

Government Response:  Yes, the government is required to retain one copy of each proposal in the contract file.  The proposals will not be released.


2.	 Industry Question: Does the Government intend to disclose a contractor’s concepts for others outside of the Government to see, or for others to compete to manufacture?

Government Response:  Yes, however proprietary information will not be released outside the Government.  If the Government paid for the design effort this information will not be proprietary.  Studies will be used for the development of performance specifications for future procurements of borescopes.  Proprietary information will not be released however information developed or as a result of those studies, which are funded by the government, may be discussed.


3.	Industry Question: Does it mean that the results, in part or in full, of the concept study cannot be used by the contractor for their own future commercial products?

Government Response: No, they can use the results in future projects with no problem.    


4.	Industry Question: Can the Navy clarify what it means by detailed design and what the expectations are on level of detail?

Government Response: The "Detailed Design" required has enough detail to prepare a performance specification for a procurement of prototype and/or production units as defined by the findings of the concept study.  Report details include overall unit design and performance output, engineering specifications, and diagrams suitable for an analytical evaluation of the ability of the design to attain the goals of the BAA.

5.	Industry Question: What kind of format does detail design mean, detailed performance spec vs detailed electrical schematics and or CAD drawings etc.?

Government Response:  The format of the detail design is a performance specification to the conclusions of the concept study.  

6.	Industry Question: On page 4 of the BAA in the last paragraph line item (4) “weight: 20 Lbs. With batteries installed.”  Does this 20 Lbs target refer to the system in its operational state or in its carry/transit case?

Government Response: The 20 Lbs weight is for the equipment itself.  This weight does not include the carry/transit case. 

The proposal submission date for this requirement remains unchanged.

<DESC>The IRS hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI) covering two separate new contractual requirements (1) mainframe hardware maintenance,  technical support services, and program management, and (2) mainframe software maintenance, software upgrades, and program management.

A.  PURPOSE:  The Internal Revenue Services (IRS), Modernization & Information Technology Services (MITS), is seeking industry capability statements for contract work in two specific areas of information technology (IT) support - hardware maintenance services and software maintenance/upgrade services.  To this end, the IRS is conducting market research and analysis of industry capabilities for the two new contracts designed to replace the current Long-Term Maintenance Computing Centers (LTMCC) contract and the Corporate System Modernization/Mirror Image Acquisition (CSM/MIA) contract which expire on September 30, 2005.  In addition, this effort will incorporate as an option, Tier 1 Mainframe hardware and software maintenance currently provided under several other IRS contracts.  The two new resulting contracts will provide for performance measures with incentives and specific socioeconomic goals to include participation by small business firms.     

B.  GENERAL:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI are the sole responsibility of the responding party.  All information received by the Government in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  

Small Businesses, 8a companies, Hub-Zone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Woman-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this RFI in order to assist the IRS in determining the levels of competition available in the marketplace.  In accordance with FAR 15.201-9(e), responses to this notice are not considered “offers” and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  When the two solicitations are released, they will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the IRS Procurement web page.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to any resulting RFP.  

C.     BACKGROUND:     The IRS MITS Organization’s Enterprise Operations Services mission is to provide efficient, cost effective, secure and highly reliable computing (server and mainframe) services for all IRS business entities and taxpayers, and to manage the day-to-day operations of the network and contact center environments.  To accomplish this mission, Enterprise Operations Services (1) deploys and maintains an infrastructure capable of supporting the business and administrative needs of the Service for both the current environment and for the IRS’ modernized operations; (2) standardizes, consolidates and manages the mainframe computing infrastructure, and ancillary systems/software; (3) maintains and modifies systems software products for the IRS mainframe-computing environment; (4) implements appropriate security and mission assurance tools, processes, procedures, and infrastructure related to corporate computing services; (5) provides services to business units/divisions within established Service Level Agreements (SLA); (6) provides enterprise network operational support; and (7) performs design, deployment, and maintenance of the contact center environment. 

D.  DESIRED INFORMATION:  MITS is in the process of analyzing and reviewing their approach, practices, and procedures for performing Tier 1 Mainframe Hardware Maintenance and Software Maintenance activities.  The Government is interested in finding out about new approaches, best practices or industry standards that could better meet its needs.  The information obtained from this RFI is intended to provide the Government with a better understanding of the methodologies, best practices, performance metrics, and service level agreements available to them in todays marketplace.  The intent is to establish two Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts – one titled Mainframe Hardware Support Maintenance Contract (MHSMC) and a second titled Mainframe Software Maintenance Contract (MSMC).  The effort contemplated will cover two separate acquisitions.  The first effort will cover hardware maintenance (remedial and preventive), warranty support, technical support, and project management.  The second effort will cover software maintenance, software upgrades, and associated program management.  The Government anticipates that the majority of resulting delivery orders issued against these contracts will be firm-fixed price.  However, given the technical support services requirements, it is likely that there will be time and materials task orders issued for services as needed.  The duration of the planned contracts is one base year (FY06) and 4 option years (FY07 through FY10).

In order to determine whether these contracts will be set-aside for small business concerns, interested vendors are encouraged to submit Capability Statements addressing their ability to perform the requirements for Area 1 - Tier 1 Mainframe hardware maintenance and/or Area 2 - software maintenance as described below.  Interested vendors may submit Capability Statements for one or both of the following two areas.

AREA 1 - TIER 1 MAINFRAME HARDWARE MAINTENANCE AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT SERVICES  (Estimated 5 Year Value $60M)

1.  Hardware maintenance for all equipment described under Area 1 will consist of 24 X 7 remedial and preventative maintenance with a two (2) hour response time performed under a set of performance-related requirements.

E.  SUBMISSION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENTS/AREAS OF INTEREST/INDUSTRY COMMENTS:  The capability statements are not to exceed 20 pages and may be submitted via e-mail no later than January 28, 2005 to Tiffany.M.Levy@irs.gov.  The Capability Statements shall include the vendor’s point(s) of contact name, address, telephone number, and email address; the company’s business size, including applicable NAICS code(s).  The Capability Statement shall address the company’s capabilities in Area 1 and/or 2, and shall further address each of the “Areas of Interest” listed below.  The Capabilities Statement shall include a description of similar work performed within the past 5 years including the name and number of the contract, the contract scope, type of contract, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer.  Information received in response to this RFI will be used to determine the acquisition strategy for any resultant RFP.  Therefore, any small business concern with the capability to perform the required services is encouraged to submit a response to the RFI. 

SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:  Following are examples of “Areas of Interest” where the Government is seeking information.  This listing is not intended to be exhaustive or all-inclusive, therefore vendors may provide additional information that they deem relevant as long as the total number of allowed pages (i.e., 20 pages) are not exceeded.  

(1)  Program Management.  The Government is interested in understanding how commercial vendors manage Mainframe Hardware Maintenance and/or Mainframe Software Maintenance contracts.  What is the vendor’s philosophy?  What is the vendor’s approach to development and management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs)?  What is the vendor’s approach to performance metrics?  What reporting mechanisms does the vendor employ?  What is the vendor’s approach to continuous process improvement?

(2)  Mainframe Hardware Maintenance and/or Software Maintenance Processes and Procedures.  How are vendors performing the maintenance lifecycle beginning with receipt of trouble tickets to close out of corrected action, asset tracking, capacity planning, and delivery methods?

(3)  Repair Services.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor all components of the repair services cycle?

(4)  Preventive Maintenance.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor required preventive maintenance services for the hardware and software?

(5)  Equipment Disposal.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor the activities associated with the removal and disposal of excess, broken, and outdated equipment?

(6)  Warranty Management.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor a comprehensive process for warranty management services?

(7)  Software Upgrades.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor a comprehensive process to maintain and upgrade software (commercial and firmware) with the latest versions available?

INDUSTRY COMMENTS:  The release of this RFI affords industry the opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments.  The Government’s purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative.  The Government believes industry feedback is important.  The Government is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  What new capabilities within the past five years have provided the biggest ROI?  Describe what you see as the industry trend over the next five years.  What has been your experience in performance-based delivery methods and techniques?  Describe your experience with performance-based and/or incentives-based contracts. 

SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS.  The Government is interested in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware and software maintenance support.  The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor day-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.).     Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics.  Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.     

Questions to the Government may be included under separate cover for all submissions.

<CONTACT>TERESA M. HENNINGER CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369319     thenning@usgs.go;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Space and Facilities, Denver, Colorado has a requirement for A&E Services to complete the design, specifications, and drawings of a building addition of approximately 80,000 square feet which is part of the Louisiana Facility Expansion Project located in Lafayette, Louisiana.  This building will house scientific laboratories and offices and will be an addition to the existing facility.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with CTA Architects and Engineers, Billings, Montana in accordance with FAR 6.302-1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies will Satisfy Agency Requirements, for the continuation of design and production of construction drawings for the facility.  Completion of this project is a follow on effort of previous task orders for design awarded to CTA under a Department of Interior IDIQ A&E contract.  In March 2005 under the existing order CTA will have completed approximately 50% of the total project and 30% of the design, drawings, and specifications and participated in the required Value Engineering. Work under a new contract will consist of completion to 100% of the final construction drawings and specifications.  It has been determined that replacing CTA with a new firm would severely burden the government with a loss of critical knowledge of the architectural, engineering, and scientific details of the existing facility and the new facility and lead to delays due to time loss to bring a new contractor up to speed which would produce a substantial duplication of costs that would likely not be recovered through competition.  This is NOT a request for proposal.  However, if another firm believes it can perform these services without a negative impact to the project they are invited to submit an affirmative response.  Should additional sources be identified who feel they can complete the requirement without loss of time or duplication of costs they are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response must include a demonstration of their ability to provide an equivalent service, rationale as to why they should be considered and demonstration that a new A&E firm would not negatively impact costs, quality, or schedule.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information shall be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the government's only official notice of this procurement.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Robotic Lunar Exploration Program/Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Communication System Request for Information THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. Overview LRO requires communications to support tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) as well as mission measurement data return.  To accomplish this LRO intends to employ S-Band for TT&C functions and Ka-Band for high rate measurement data.  Proximity relay is planned to enable mission cross-support at S-Band.   Requested Response The LRO mission requests that interested parties provide inputs and suggestions as to how best to achieve the communication goals of the LRO mission (and extend into the RLEP program).  Responses may include component or system level concepts including transceivers, software defined radios, transponders, modulators, SSPAs and TWTAs in S- and Ka-Bands in addition to passive components that enable LRO’s mission communications.  The project is interested in learning of individual component technologies as well as complete system concepts.   Cost and schedule are discriminators in LRO’s eventual selection of any solution, and so the project is mostly interested with responses that closely match or exceed LRO’s assumed requirements, however, the project is very interested in learning of potential technology developments that could benefit LRO, RLEP and the Agency.   In addition to the general topics discussed above, the LRO mission requests the following.  Interested parties do not have to respond to the following questions if they do not apply to their proposed component / technology / system. 1.	Discuss a minimum-cost, minimum-risk method of achieving the communication goals of LRO.  This may involve independent communication systems to support TT&C, high-rate and proximity relay.  Discuss the proposed architecture and components.  Provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO.  Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, mass and power requirements of this solution. 2.	Discuss an in-flight reconfigurable method of achieving the communication goals of LRO.  This may involve independent systems to support TT&C, high-rate and proximity relay.	The systems must, however be adaptable and reconfigurable by software/firmware load on orbit.	LRO wishes to consider this option to understand the implications of building into LRO adaptability to support future technologies that may be developed as the program moves forward.  Discuss the proposed architecture and components.  Provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO.	Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, mass and power requirements of this solution. 3.	Discuss a minimum hardware option that aims to combine the three primary communication functions into one system.  In-flight reconfigurability is again a goal of this option.  Discuss the proposed architecture and components.  Provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO.  Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, mass and power requirements of this solution. 4.	Discuss any other methods, options or technologies you believe of benefit to the LRO and RLEP programs. Information also is sought from communication vendors on the following thermal considerations related to communication system technologies:  1.	Methods to minimize heater power. 2.	Methods to minimize thermal coupling of communication system to rest of the spacecraft. 3.	Approaches which simply thermal integration and qualification. Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information.  Information submitted in response to this Request for Information will be used for LRO and RLEP concept development activities.  Parties proposing concepts of interest to LRO and RLEP may be invited to submit more detailed information or to discuss their concepts further. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Jason Soloff at (301) 286-1368 or Jason.A.Soloff@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov. Interested offerors shall address the requirements of this RFI in written format as described in the previous paragraphs by electronic mail to: Jason Soloff at Jason.A.Soloff@nasa.gov, no later than 5:00 PM EST on February 12, 2005. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<SUBJECT>99--Development of a Prototype Handheld Battery Operated, Pulse Arrested Spark Discharge (PASD) Pulser
<SOLNBR>3963
<RESPDATE>012805
<CONTACT>Kevin Dillon, 609.485.6911
<DESC>Development of a Prototype Handheld, Battery Operated, Pulse Arrested Spark Discharge (PASD) Pulser 1. Background The continued safe operation of aircraft well into their expected service life depends on the safe and effective transfer of power and electrical signals throughout the aircraft electrical wiring interconnect system (EWIS).  This in turn requires the verification and monitoring of the EWIS physical and functional integrity.  In the event that the EWIS is treated as an indefinite life item, formal periodic inspections will be necessary to ensure its continued safe operation.  Whether the EWIS is eventually subject to a fixed service life, condition based monitoring, or other life management program, there will still be a need for periodic inspection to: 1) ensure the absence of accidental damage; 2) verify service life estimates; and, 3) confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving the EWIS. 2. Purpose The purpose of this solicitation is the development of a prototype handheld, battery operated unit using Pulse Arrested Spark Discharge (PASD) technology which can be integrated with signal processing and fault detection and location provided by another standard commercial such as portable digitizer (oscilloscope) or lap-top computer with signal input capabilities. The system shall capture and analyze impedance waveforms from at least two additional technologies The system shall require operator training not far beyond training for use of a standard Volt-Ohm meter.  The contractor will develop the technology and pursue up to and including exclusive licensing rights with Sandia National Laboratories for the PASD technology.  Non-destructive inspection technologies are required to: 	Ensure the absence of accidental damage and/or EWIS degradation due to      aging and operations. 	Verify service life estimates. 	Confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving the EWIS. 	Locate and characterize EWIS damage due to aging and operation. 	Locate and characterize precursors to EWIS failure due to aging and operation. 	Determine location of arc faults when troubleshooting an arc fault condition. 	Determine location of open and shorted faults in the EWIS. 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals (see section 5) prepared in accordance with this synopsis will be accepted through 31 January 2005 or until funding for this effort is committed, whichever occurs first.  Upon request of the FAA, formal technical proposals shall be submitted not more than thirty days after the date of the request.  This request will be made via email and letter. 4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit a formal proposal.  The formal proposal  shall meet the requirements described below.  Offerors shall mail the Formal Proposal to: William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480 (Attn: M. Walz) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the proposal will be emailed to michael.walz@faa.gov and cesar.gomez@faa.gov .  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format. Thirty days after receipt of the proposal, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of  Two ways: a.	Rejection of the proposal. b.	Acceptance of the proposal 5. Formal Proposal Requirements  a.	Offerors shall specify the development of the device with performance and cost specifications matching the requirements of some application or class of applications of interest to some segment of the aviation community.  The device may measure:      1.	Physical properties of the EWIS (elastic modulus, hardness, etc.);      2.	Material and structural anomalies (cuts, abrasions, chemical properties, etc.);      3.	Local electrical properties of the EWIS (dielectric constants, resistance, etc.);      4.	Bulk electrical properties of the EWIS (resistance, impedance, capacitance, isolation, AC&DC voltage drop, polarization ratio, dissipation factor, etc.); or,     5.	Any other relevant EWIS properties (thermal excursions under load, electromagnetic fields, etc.). a.      If the proposal includes means for test and inspection of aircraft wiring, offerors will select Polyimide, and two or more wire types from the list below that are inspectable by the proposed device.  These selections will be used to independently validate the performance of the device.      1.	PVC/Glass/Nylon (MIL-W-5086, QUAD 4, etc.).     2.	Cross Linked ETFE (MIL-W-22759, Tefzel, Spec 55, etc).     3.	Poly-X (alkane-imide).     4.	Composite construction involving Polyimide or Teflon (TKT, etc). b.	Using empirical evidence and sound logic, offerors will present a persuasive argument that the properties, states, and/or conditions (aging and non-aging conditions) measured by the device correlate with EWIS failure modes that threaten the safety of the aircraft.  The offerer's proposal shall contain specific and detailed performance specifications for the proposed system. c.	Offerors shall build a prototype device with the specifications identified above.  For the purposes of preparing the proposal and cost estimate, the prototype shall become the property of the FAA at the conclusion of the program. d.	Offerors shall propose to the FAA a validation plan, which includes double blind testing.  Validation will be performed on the Standard Wiring Testbed located at Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM.  Contact Mr. Mike Dinallo, 505-844-0796, for more information on the testbed.  If the testbed is not suitable to the validation of the proposed technology, please address the rational for this conclusion and an alternative means for validation.  The proposal will address all costs related to the validation effort.  Use of the Standard Wiring Testbed is free of charge. e.	The proposal shall identify all areas risk related to development, and implementation,  of the proposed system, technology, or technique.  The proposal shall include mitigating strategies for each risk area.  Proposals that do not identify risk areas will be considered non-developmental in nature and therefore outside the scope of this research program.  Implementation risks are associated with logistical issues, missing/inadequate support infrastructure, etc. f.	Offerors shall include in their proposals a detailed cost proposal.  In-house funding, cost matching, services-in-kind, will be identified in the cost proposal as necessary.  All manpower related to double blind testing and validation shall also be provided.  The cost of the delivered prototype shall be identified separately. 8. Method of Evaluation  Proposals will be evaluated in the seven technical areas listed in order of decreasing importance:    a.	Technical merit.    b.	Utility to the aviation community.    c.	Investigative team competency and experience.    d.	Logical and effective validation strategy.    e.	Technical risks and implementation risks, and the mitigation plan for each.    f.	Availability and quality of equipment and facilities.    g.	Effective project management plan. 9. Period of Performance:  Efforts lasting only one year will be considered

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  No contract will be awarded pur suant to this announcement.  This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for any information or action forwarded in response to this announcement.  The TMA h as a requirement to evaluate, select, purchase, and oversee a contract that will support healthy lifestyle prevention initiatives.  The contractor will have a strong program management component with demonstrated capability to identify and combine, when ap propriate, resources to define, plan, implement and integrate the requirements of the Tobesahol (tobacco, obesity and alcohol) initiatives.  The program management portion of the contract would be designed to eliminate redundant administrative costs by cen tralizing oversight, management, monitoring and reporting on each of the three initiatives (tobacco, obesity, and alcohol).  The goal of central program management would be cost control and monitoring effectiveness of the three health program initiatives.  The Contractor should address the benefits of a single program manager for planning, design management, budgeting, milestone compliance and ongoing operations services.  The contractor should identify how it will be possible to maintain timely communicati ons, anticipate project risks, develop contingency plans, and keep their strategy to keep Tobesahol projects within budget and on target for successful reporting and completion.  Throughout the course of the tobacco and obesity demonstrations or the alcoho l prevention study the program management component will regularly communicate current information and accurate status of program initiatives to the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, TRICARE Management Activity.  These initiatives include: 1. A four-state demo nstration project providing non-AD DoD beneficiaries over age 13 with a self-reported BMI greater than 25 access to either a commercially purchased interactive internet behavioral weight loss program or telephone behavioral support in conjunction with a we ight loss manual. 2. A commercial program that will provide a four state demonstration project that executes a proactive DoD-sponsored 1-800 Number Quitline for Tobacco Cessation. 3. A commercial program that will provide an eight base/installation web-bas ed alcohol prevention education demonstration project.   While the goal of each of the initiatives is to prevent and reduce unhealthy lifestyle choices, each initiative has specific program requirements.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine all interested and available vendors capab le of supporting the initiatives identified.  In response to this RFI, clearly describe your companys products, professional services, and support capabilities to fullfill the following requirement in its entirety.

The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) is seeking qualified companies with the expertise to provide comprehensive services for the Acquisition planning and management implementation of GPO’s Future Digital Systems (FDsys) Companies are hereby requested to submit a capability statement (10 pages or less and no marketing material) that addresses their ability to perform the service described below and company points of contact and GSA Schedule number (if applicable).  All responses should be sent via e-mail to: lferezan@gpo.gov or mail to the Government Printing Office, 732 North Capitol Street, NW, Washington, DC 20401, Mail Stop: CSAS/LF.  PLEASE DO NOT MAKE PHONE CALLS!  This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate the GPO in any way.  This is not a request for proposal and the GPO will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information.                                                                                                                 BACKGROUND 
GPO’s mission includes both printing government documents and disseminating them to the public. Under the public printing and documents statutes of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO’s mission is to fulfill the printing needs of the federal government and to distribute those printed products to the public. All printing for the Congress, the executive branch, and the judiciary—except for the Supreme Court—is to be done or contracted by GPO except for authorized exemptions. The Superintendent of Documents, who heads GPO’s Information Dissemination Department, disseminates these government products to the public through a system of nearly 1,300 depository libraries nationwide (the Federal Depository Library Program), GPO’s Web site (GPO Access), telephone and fax ordering, an on-line ordering site, and its bookstore in Washington, D.C.  The Superintendent of Documents is also responsible for classification and bibliographic control of tangible and electronic government publications.

The proposed future system will ingest, preserve and provide access to electronic content of all three Branches of the U.S. Government. The proposed future system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic and dynamic means for preserving electronic content free from dependence on specific hardware and/or software. The system should automate many of the electronic content lifecycle processes and make it easier to deliver electronic content in formats suited to customers’ needs. 
•	GPO's future system will allow the federal government to create content, and for GPO to subsequently receive, preserve, and provide access to electronic information. 
•	GPO's future system will be an integrated process that provides maximum efficiency and value for users. 
•	GPO has taken a lifecycle management of content approach to managing and preserving content. This approach promotes more effective and efficient processes by sharing relevant data and seamless transition from one phase to another. 
•	The proposed future system will support GPO’s end-to-end lifecycle management processes, including the creation of content, schedules, transfer, and archival description, for all content, i.e., electronic and non-electronic.
•	The future system will be built using the OAIS reference model framework.

A smart or precision materiel solution would exhibit the following key attributes, qualities and performance characteristics:  (1) An incremental, spira l development program based upon weight categories; (2) Weights:   Increment 1:  A 2,200 lb fully-rigged weight category to align with the current CDS/A22 capability; Increment 2:  A 10,000 lb fully-rigged weight category to align with current Enhanced CDS/platform initiatives; Increment 3:  A 30,000 lb fully-rigged weigh t category to align with PLS/LHS/FTTS/intermodal flatrack and CROP capabilities;  Increment 4:  A 42,000 lb fully-rigged weight category to align with upper PLS flatrack capability/C-130 maximum capability and planned FCS weight; (3) Accuracy.  On-ground accuracy differs based on family member weight category.  Lighter loads provide gre ater accuracy while heavier loads provide decreased accuracy.  Accuracy would be dramatically increased by interface with any USAF initiatives to improve CARP and weather fidelity.  Accuracy is from 10,000 feet MSL and higher, limited only by the performan ce characteristics of the air carriers.  Increased capability in accuracy decreases DZ size, allows prompt recovery and unit assembly, and places loads into the hands of the intended ground recipients.  Accuracy capability from high altitudes provides incr eased air carrier survivability:  A 2,200 lb accuracy would be 50-100 meters circular error probable (CEP)/point of impact, plus or minus; A 10,000 lb accuracy would be 100-150 meters CEP/point of impact, plus or minus; A 30,000 lb accuracy would be 150-25 0 meters CEP/point of impact, plus or minus;  and A 42,000 lb accuracy would be 250-350 meters CEP/point of impact, plus or minus; (4) Reliability.  A reliability factor of no less than 0.95, with a corresponding high level of confidence factor for all fam ily members; (5) High Altitude-Capable.  Precision capability would be air releasable from altitudes up to and exceeding 20,000 ft MSL, and limited only by air carrier performance characteristics.  A 35,000 feet MSL capability is envisioned.  Precision cap ability negates wind effects from these altitudes and provides additional air carrier survivability; (6) NET Ready.  Global Positioning System (GPS)-Precision Positioning System (PPS)-guided, and J-6 driven and (7) Other Attributes/Characteristics.  Target ed Air Carriers.  Primary air carriers are the AMC C-17 and all models/versions of C-130.  This does not exclude possibilities associated with the C-5, C-141, CRAF, or commercial aerial delivery platforms as capable, equipped, and available.  Among service s, there is a rotary-wing fleet too numerous to exclude.  While airdrop from rotorcraft is atypical, the CH-53, CH-46, CH-47, UH-60, etc. are all 2,200 and 10,000 lb weight-capable, and provide a forward, highly battlefield presence that should be explored .  Multiple Loads to Multiple Destinations.  There will be multiple airdrop loads internal to air carriers.  Capability allows for loads to be programmed to a single ground destination/location, or individually programmed to different ground locations.  Ca pability provides for sequential release at a single aerial release point, and enables airdrop cargo/load re-supply to multiple, on-ground customers at multiple, highly dispersed locations. Waypoint Navigation.  Capability allows for the programming of the airdrop vehicle to fly a selected course, and to be at different locations over the surface of the earth during descent.  Go here, then here, then here . . .prior to landing destination and  impact.  The ability to program a minimal of three waypoints is being e xamined.  Such capability provides for masking opportunities and obstacle avoidance, and is highly beneficial to the standoff aspect of employment.  Most importantly, such capability is a key element in overcoming the constant downwind landing associated w ith non-precision airdrop loads, providing for into the wind terminal leg.  The obvious benefits are softer landing and increased load survivability.  Flared Landing.  With an increased knowledge of airdrop load location relative to the ground just prior t o impact, this capability is possible.  Capability would convert and decay forward airspeed to a cushioning effect.  The attribute would increase DZ safety, load survivability, and decrease the need for additional impact absorbing materials.  Maintenance P lanning.  Full contractor logistics support of this capability is considered both practical and easily executed.  This releases current 92R personnel from maintenance intensive tasks and allows riggers to focus upon assembling materiel to be airdropped, ri gging it, and offering rigged/pre-rigged loads to USAF personnel.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  Information provided will be used to develop specif ic requirements for a future JPADS.  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited.  A pre-solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated.  N o awards will result from this request.  We are seeking sources, technical and product information for products which meet the Army's requirements, or may meet requirements with modifications.

<CONTACT>joyce.croci, 508-233-4360
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from the U. S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)/PM Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA to identify sources interested in supplying a Low Cost Aerial Delivery System (LCADS). The LCAD  system will provide a low cost alternative to compliment the current Container Delivery System (CDS) for fast and efficient airdrop of supply loads during operations that do not allow for recovery of air items, as often is the case with combat re-supply o r humanitarian assistance missions. During Operation Provide Promise in Bosnia, U.S. Forces delivered humanitarian aid using over $31 million of standard airdrop equipment with no equipment recovered. The LCADS design will greatly reduce airdrop mission co sts.  LCADS will be a one-time use, stand-alone airdrop system consisting of a modular suite of low cost airdrop items, and be comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items configured for low-velocity (impact velocity of 28.5 fps), hi gh-velocity (impact velocity of 90 fps), and free-drop (without the use of a parachute) aerial delivery of loads.  All components must be simple in design, maintenance and operation, and have low production and lifecycle costs. The emphasis is on use of re adily available, low cost materials and ease of manufacturing in order to minimize production lead times and broaden the industrial base for LCADS items.  Innovative designs, processes, and materials should be considered in the development of LCADS compone nts. Some examples include, but are not limited to, cross parachutes, stitch-less seaming technology and non-woven fabrics.  Product characteristics should minimize or eliminate rigging time, have a shelf life comparable to materials currently used in CDS components, and have low weight and volume. LCADS has both performance and cost requirements. LCADS performance threshold (T) and objective (O) requirements are: (1) Must meet the rigged load capacity of 500-lbs to 2,200-lbs (T) of current CDS drops or exc eed 2,200-lbs (O). Future requirements will be for capacities of up to 10,000-lbs; (2) Must be capable of delivering serviceable loads in 13-knot ground winds (T), 18-knot ground winds (O); (3) Must meet (T) or exceed (O) the load accuracy and survivabilit y of current high-velocity and low-velocity CDS drops; (4) Must be air-droppable from standard AF cargo aircraft (T) and special operations, NATO and other services aircraft (O); (5) Must be compatible with Army and Air Force ground material handling equip ment (MHE); (6) Must be capable of being deployed at release altitudes between 500-ft AGL (O) to 1,250-ft AGL (T) for low-velocity drops and 15,000-ft MSL (T) to 25,000-ft MSL (O) for hi-velocity drops at airspeeds of 130-150 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS ).  LCADS cost threshold (T) and objective (O) requirements are: (1) LCADS must reduce costs by 55 percent or more (T) to 80 percent or more (O) over current Container Delivery System (CDS). This means that the cost for a container must be between $67 and $150, high-velocity parachute must be between $150 and $335 and for a low-velocity parachute between $726 and $1,635. Cost requirements include both cost of materials and producibility of components. Materials used to construct components are readily avail able. System components shall be easy to manufacture.  Production lead times shall be minimized.  At this time, RDECOM is seeking sources, concepts, technical and product information, for a Low Cost Aerial Delivery System or any individual components that meet the above requirements. Also, information is sought for materials and processes that would allow for ease of manufacturing and minimize production lead times.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government; however, if it i s submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  Information provided will be used to develop specific requirement for LCADS.  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited.  A pre-solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated.  No awards will result from this request.  We are seeking sources, techn ical and product information for products which meet the Army's requirements, or may meet requirements with modifications.

<SUBJECT>A -- SEMI-AUTOMATIC LOCKOUT SYSTEM FOR SAFER BALERS USER BY THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-2005-DSR-0001
<RESPDATE>022705
<ARCHDATE>03142005
<CONTACT>Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov - Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) to work with a machine safeguarding  manufacturer to design, test, and evaluate the marketability of the semi-automatic lockout system (JamAlert) for balers used by the recycling industry that NIOSH has previously designed and tested.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of operators of horizontal balers by bringing the JamAlert device into the marketplace. This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the JamAlert a profitable safety product.  Presently, safe clearing of jammed balers is limited because the personnel who perform this task must remember to complete all the steps of a manual shutdown and lockout of the baler power supply.  Training can help with getting personnel to take these steps, but people often do not follow the designated procedures.  There is currently no form of passive protection, such as the JamAlert, available for balers for protecting operators from fatal injury when clearing jams.  The JamAlert device developed by NIOSH is normally in a standby mode for day-to-day use.  If a jam condition is detected by the strain gage sensor on the baler’s shear bar, the baler will be automatically shut down, and a captured key will be released that must be used to lock out the power supply before the jam can be safely cleared.  Field tests of the JamAlert have been conducted by NIOSH on a horizontal baler.  The results of these tests show that the JamAlert may be a viable device that could be used to help prevent deaths and injuries due to personnel being caught during an unexpected restart of a jammed baler. 

Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, will be evaluated by their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the JamAlert into commercial production.   NIOSH does not guarantee to sign a LOA with any presented company. NIOSH does not guarantee purchasing or testing of equipment provided by the selected partner company.   NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities described in this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

JamAlert Commercialization Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should meet all of these requirements, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Providing significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing the JamAlert.  This would include defining the cost and usability needs of a target, recycling center market.  Also, provide assistance in setting realistic product cost objectives and providing suggestions on how the JamAlert can achieve product cost goals - Required; 
(B) Fabricating  prototypes for test and evaluation - Required; 
(C) Providing expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations involving recycling center worker populations - Required; 
(D) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications - Required; 
(E) Reviewing testing methods and recommending appropriate, new testing criteria - Required; 
(F) Working with recycling centers to provide NIOSH with access to balers so that further field tests can be conducted – Required.  

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas. A company that is qualified and currently is producing balers or machine safety devices is highly desired. However, past testing and design of devices exactly like the JamAlert is not required. If prior testing has been performed, the test information and results should be provided. Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.) Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the NIOSH project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement. Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period. Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety. Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged. The government has identified March 8th and 9th, 2005 for these presentations to be conducted. The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Technology Service (FTS) is responsible for delivering best value and innovative network solutions to support government agency missions worldwide.  FTS currently delivers a set of billing operations and management (O&M) capabilities to its agency customers using its own billing system and in-house resources.  To manage its growing list of dynamic network services and deliver additional value-added services to agency customers in the next generation of contracts, such as FTS Networx, FTS has studied alternative billing business models, hereafter referred to as billing solutions.  One of the billing solutions considers the use of a telecommunications industry expert billing solution provider to deliver the following capabilities:

•	Current FTS billing O&M
•	Business and performance information management
•	Inventory management
•	Customized billing services and/or add-on capabilities

These capabilities are described in Section 2 of this document.  FTS, via this Request for Information (RFI), seeks descriptive information on the billing solution providers’ management and technical capabilities, pricing models, performance management practices, management and functional processes, and systems that can be used to deliver the billing solution mentioned above.  Further, FTS requests any suggestions for modifying our approach to delivering these capabilities based on billing solution providers' previous experiences in similar environments.  

1.2	Objectives of the Billing Solution

The billing solution must enable FTS to achieve the following objectives:

•	Meet agency needs for a comprehensive billing solution with                                                                                              
        flexible billing options that adapt to individual agency           
        requirements and preferences
•	Obtain best value (lowest prices while maintaining quality 
        of service levels)
•	Accommodate the evolution of telecommunications network 
        services, the means by which they are offered individually 
        or together, and the varying pricing mechanisms and  
        structures for those services from the network service 
        providers
•	Deliver billing capabilities for new network services in a 
        timely manner
•	Provide agency customers with value-added services,  
        including customized billing services or add-on 
        capabilities to agency customers
•	Support inventory management plus business and performance 
        information management
•	Deliver efficiency and high-performance
•	Reduce current FTS operational costs or provide enhanced 
        services at no additional expense
 
1.3	Document Organization

Section 2 describes the required capabilities mentioned above.  Section 3 contains a list of subjects on which the Government seeks descriptive information from the billing solution providers. 
Section 4 gives specific instructions for responding to this RFI.

2.	SOLUTION CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION

This section describes the four required capabilities:

•	Current FTS billing O&M
•	Business and performance information management
•	Inventory management
•	Customized billing services or add-on capabilities

2.1	Current FTS Billing O&M

FTS currently delivers the following billing O&M capabilities to agency customers:

•	Invoice Processing
•	Invoice Validation and Verification
•	Disputes Management
•	Customer Billing
•	Collections and Payments Processing
•	Online Reporting (via a Website accessible by FTS and 
        agency customers)

Note:  FTS does not re-rate network service providers’ invoices.  FTS validates and forwards the invoices to its agency customers.  FTS refers to its contracted network service providers as industry partners.

2.2	Business and Performance Information Management

FTS developed processes, models, and systems that used data from various sources to generate analytical information and management reports to its executives.  These analytical information and management reports enable FTS to monitor and manage the performance of its business and to conduct special studies on specific business areas.  Industry partners’ raw billing data is a major source of input to those business and performance management processes, models, and systems.  FTS considers including the analytical information and management reports generation capability as part of the billing solution.

Below are some examples of analyses, standard reports, and ad hoc reports currently in use:

•	Historical traffic and cost trends analysis
•	Contract price reduction analysis
•	Voice vs. data services trends analysis
•	Cost savings analysis (e.g., contract price vs. commercial              
        price comparison)
•	Optimization study of services delivered

2.3	Inventory Management

FTS recognizes the relationship between inventory management functions and billing functions.  FTS considers inventory management capability as part of the billing solution.  To deliver this capability, the billing solution provider’s inventory management system must derive its inventory data from the service order completion notices from FTS industry partners.  The billing solution provider therefore must coordinate and work with FTS industry partners to develop and implement this process.  The billing solution provider’s inventory will be used for verification and validation of industry partners’ invoices.

Additionally, FTS coordinates with the customer agencies, who maintain their own inventories from the orders they submit and the service order completion notices from FTS industry partners.  The billing solution provider's inventory will be used as an independent source from which to verify and validate agencies' inventories.  The billing solution provider will support a process for working with the agencies to resolve any discrepancies between what FTS receives from industry partners and the agencies' inventories.    

2.4	Customized Billing Services or Add-on Capabilities

Agency customers increasingly require customized solutions to meet their specific needs.  FTS is considering offering customized billing services or add-on capabilities to agency customers as part of the billing solution.  Examples of these services and capabilities include agency-specific reports, service quote and order management, and service financial planning and budget forecast.

3.	INFORMATION REQUEST

FTS would like to receive descriptive information from the billing solution providers on the following subjects:

1.	For the four (4) required capabilities, a description of the billing solution provider’s commercial management and technical approach to deliver them individually and as an integrated solution.  For the individual capability, please describe the provider’s management and technical/functional capabilities, pricing models, performance management practices, O&M and functional processes, and systems.  As an integrated solution, please describe the service, system, and information architecture.

For the delivery of the capabilities, please provide a description of the provider’s lifecycle delivery management practices starting from planning, development, initial setup, deployment, training to O&M and service retirement.  Please specifically provide the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the overall delivery performance, and ultimately to ensure the timeliness and quality of the delivery of the capability at the initial startup as well as throughout the life of the contract. 

2.	The existing processes/procedures (including varying data formats) and the overall interface between the billing solution provider and the network service providers for seamless and interoperable O&M of the required capabilities (i.e., ordering, invoicing, inventory management, dispute, etc.).  Please list the network service providers with whom the billing solution provider currently has an established relationship, processes, and procedures and the associated capabilities/functions.

3.	The provider’s on-line billing capabilities and processes.

4.	The provider’s current practice, approach, or integrated service/system architecture that allows the accommodation of a variety of new, changing network services with varying pricing structures, rating and discount mechanisms, and varying service elements by different network service providers.  Please describe how such practice, approach, or architecture enables timely delivery of billing capabilities for those new services.

5.	The provider’s commercial approach to accommodate customized billing services and/or add-on services, including the associated pricing mechanism(s).

6.	The provider’s current billing service portfolio/offerings and the associated pricing structure(s) and prices.  Please show the different levels of billing services available (e.g., gold, silver service packages).  Please provide detailed pricing structure for each component identified by the provider.  For the pricing structure, FTS is interested in the types of one-time charges and monthly recurring charges.  For these charges, FTS is interested in receiving information on the pricing units (by transaction, by volume, by customer, by reports, etc.).

7.	Please indicate the extent to which the provider delivers the capabilities described in this RFI to its existing customer base.  If the provider does not currently have a capability described herein, so identify and describe any plans for adding that capability.

8.	All network services that the billing solution provider can 
        support and the extent to which the provider delivers them 
        to existing customers.  

9.	Any recommended modifications to the approach or  
        requirements as stated.  

10.	The means by which the billing solution provider achieves 
        efficiency that results in lower costs.

11.	The provider’s level of experience in working with any 
        Government agencies in the past.
 
4.	INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO THIS RFI

Interested parties may respond to this RFI in accordance with the instructions provided in this section.  Table 4-1 below provides the appropriate guidance.

Table 4-1 -- RFI Response Guide

Description:	Response Requirements

Why the Government is requesting information:	 This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Responses to the request will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The intent is to assess information provided by the industry in response to this RFI and to perform other market research as a way of informing the Government about alternatives and capabilities available in the marketplace.  Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror’s ability to respond to an RFP if the Government issues one at a later date.

Due date for RFI response:	February 1, 2005, 3:00 P.M.

Response format:	Microsoft Word 98 or newer

How to respond:	       Email and/or USPS Mail

Where to respond:	Contracting Officer

email:     robert.hayhurst@gsa.gov

address:      General Services Administration, 10300 Eaton Place, Fifth Floor, Fairfax, VA 22030

How to mark the response:	Identify the entity responding, including name of the entity, point of contact, address, telephone number, email address, web site address, etc.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR subsection 3.104-4.

How proprietary information will be treated:	See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.  The Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when a draft Networx billing RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product billing rollout plans for a new telecommunications service, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

What will be done with the responses:	The Government intends to refine the billing objective and associated documents as appropriate based on all sources of input received, especially responses to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to respond unilaterally to individual respondents unless clarification of information submitted is required.  All contact will be through the Contracting Officer.

STATEMENT OF NEED

I.  Introduction

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Office of Federal Lands Highways (FLH) is striving to improve its ability to communicate, track, and assure implementation of environmental commitments for highway improvement projects.  To that end, FLH is seeking to document current practices in the three FLH Divisions, identify and evaluate best practices among State DOTs, and design and implement an environmental commitment tracking system.  Information on FLH is available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh/index.htm. 

In the fall of 2002, FHWA’s Office of Project Development and Environmental Review sponsored the Domestic Scan Tour on Environmental Commitment Implementation (Domestic Scan).  The Domestic Scan focused on successful practices and procedures for following through on environmental commitments made during and after the NEPA process.  Examples of best management practices are presented in the final report that is intended to assist states, FHWA Divisions, environmental resource agencies, and the private sector in successfully implementing environmental commitments through project design, development, construction, and maintenance.  The final report, dated July 2003, is available at http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/domScanRpt/execsumm.htm.   This report is the foundation for the work requested herein and should be thoroughly reviewed prior to the kickoff meeting.  Examples of commitment assurance practices and tracking mechanisms are particularly relevant.

II.  Tasks

Task 1 - Kickoff Meeting  

Within 15 days after award, the contractor’s key technical staff (assume 2 people) shall meet with FHWA staff at the Western Federal Lands (WFL) office located in Vancouver, WA, for a half-day meeting to discuss in broad terms the depth of coverage anticipated for the major tasks and the overall work plan for the project.

GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Firing Test Division of Red Stone Technical Test Center (RTTC) Firing Test Division has a need to procure one radar analyzer.  The FSG currently has Weibel radars in support of missile and rocket testing.  The Weibel Doppler Analyzer is compatible with existing equipment and can be integrated directly with the interface with minimum hardware and software changes.  Weibel Equipment is a small business that can provide the only know radar analyzer that is compatible with the existing systems.  Through the use of market research including literature review, internal searches, and expert knowledge from G. Lehn Brooks, Chief, Firing Test Division, RTTC, it has been determined that the equipment required by RTTC is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements.  Thorough market surveys indicate that the Weibel Scientific W700 is the only system compatible with the existing Weibel radar systems and requires a minimum of hardware and software to interface with existing equipment.  Award to another vendor would result in a modification of existing equipment to accommodate another vendor's system.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST January 26, 2005 will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>66--Pulsed Laser as an Entangled Photon Source Pump
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS – IT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is requesting information from Contractors on robust, high repetition rate pulsed laser pumps for production of maximally entangled photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).  

Submissions addressing available information/technology, or adaptations thereof, as well as technical comments on pumps meeting some or all of the specifications identified herein are being requested.  Submissions shall include, but are not limited to, product literature, technical data, and/or adaptation schemes.  Information on the Contractor’s experience in building the same or similar equipment, and the proposed availability of equipment is also requested.  

Contractors shall identify their business size, (small, small-disadvantaged, hub-zone, large etc.) in accordance with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  If the equipment is manufactured by other than the respondent, please provide business size information on the manufacturer as well.

Responses to this notice must be sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, Attn: Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.  Submission must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on January 31, 2005.

Original submissions are required.

Specifications for a Pulsed Laser as an Entangled Photon Source Pump NIST has a need for robust high repetition rate pulsed laser pumps for production of maximally-entangled photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).  There are two distinct entangled photon pair wavelength ranges of interest.  With this and respecting that summed energies of the SPDC photon pair must equal the energy of the pump photon, constraints on corresponding pump wavelengths are determined.

The first range of interest permits optimal detection of polarization-entangled photons through the atmosphere with a Si Avalanche Photodiode (APD).  Si APD has near-peak detection efficiency in the range of 550-810 nm and the preferred atmospheric transmission range is 740-810 nm (peaking at 770 nm).  The desired pump wavelength range is 310-410 nm, with the understanding that resulting SPDC wavelengths should avoid several atmospheric absorption lines in the range mentioned above (see fig 5 of Nordholt, Jane E., Richard J. Hughes, George L. Morgan, Charles G. Peterson, Christopher C. Wipf, “Present and Future Free-Space Quantum Key Distribution,” Free-Space Laser Communication Technologies XIV, G. Stephen Mecherle, Editor, Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 4635 (2002), pp 115-126, LA-UR-01-6817). Thus at least one of the down-converted photon pair must be within the preferred atmospheric transmission window (740-810 nm) and the other photon should be in the Si APD detection window (550-810 nm).   Pumps for degenerate entangled photon pairs are preferred (both within 740-810 nm range).  

The other range of interest corresponds to production of time-bin entangled pairs at the telecom wavelength of 1310 nm.  Allowable ranges are approximately 1280 to 1330 nm, and thus corresponding permissible pump ranges are 640 to 665 nm.  For example, a 655 nm pump would produce degenerate 1310 nm photon pairs.

Nondegenerate SPDC generation with one photon near the 1310-nm telecom wavelength is also acceptable.  An entangled pair consisting of a photon in the 1280-1330 nm range and a photon in the Si APD detection range can be produced using a pump wavelength in the range of 385-500 nm.  Although alternative solutions are not precluded, particular attention will be given to diode and fiber based constructions. 

NIST’s requirements for these pump lasers are as follows:

Average power/Pulse energy – we require a minimum of 500 mw of average power; within the 10 MHz to 1 GHz repetition rate range requirement, we prefer higher energy per pulse with a goal of 50 nJ/pulse;

Laser wavelength- fixed in the range of 310 to 410 nm (first priority) or 385 to 500 nm or 640 to 665 nm (second priority);

Laser bandwidth less than/equal to 0.05 nm;

Wavelength stability/tolerance less than 10% of 0.05 nm;

Spatial mode – a minimum of 500 mW in TEM00 (this is defined as the amount of power that can be coupled into a single mode fiber.); 

Pulse duration less than or equal to 0.5 ns;

Rep rate greater than or equal to 10 MHz;

Duty factor less than or equal to 10% (this becomes a factor for rep rates above 200 MHz);

Power stability – fluctuations less than or equal to 5%;

Pointing stability – fluctuations less than or equal to 10% of beam divergence;

Polarization purity/ stability greater than 100:1;

Timing jitter with respect to trigger less than 10% of pulse duration;

Physical size – compactness desirable, entire system including electronics must fit in a standard 19    inch instrument rack ca. volumes of 18 inches x 24 inches x 3.5 inches or 18 inches x 9 inches x 10inches power consumption less than 10 W target (100 W max) wall-socket power;

System can employ harmonic generation to generate pump wavelengths;

Turnkey system operation, no user serviceable parts;

Output may be fiber pigtailed.

NIST is most interested in pump technology that promises straightforward extension to both the atmospheric (Si Detection) and telecom interests.  In the absence of a system meeting both needs, the Si detection application is preferred.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities for animal feeding operations (AFOs) which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved. A CNMP incorporates practices to 1) Use animal manure, process wastewater and other organic by-products as a beneficial resource; 2) Address potential impacts of an AFO on natural resources, including water and air quality; and 3) Assist an AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, State, Federal, and Tribal water quality goals and regulations. CNMPs services may include engineering surveys, engineering designs, and construction activities for animal manure and wastewater handling and storage projects and other conservation practices, such as grade stabilization structures and ponds within the State of Idaho.  CNMPs will be developed and certified to assist with implementation of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).  Surveys required may consist of but are not limited to any part or all of the following activities:  topographic surveys, design surveys, geotechnical surveys, and construction layout surveys.  Design activities required may consist of but are not limited to any part or all of the following activities:  design animal manure and wastewater handling and storage project features, prepare construction specifications, prepare construction plans (drawings), prepare cost estimates, quantity computation checks and certifications, and prepare design folders.  Construction activities will include construction inspection, checkout, and certification.  The typical project could require knowledge and experience in all aspects of animal manure and wastewater volume estimates, rainfall runoff calculation, surveying, engineering design and quality assurance activities associated with the design and construction of waste storage ponds, earth embankments, reinforced concrete structures, clay and flexible liners, wastewater conveyance pipelines, diversions, and sediment basins.  The A-E firm will be required to perform engineering surveys and engineering design activities in accordance with NRCS standards and certify that all surveys and designs meet NRCS standards.  NRCS standards can be found in the NRCS Idaho Field Office Technical Guide and design guidance can be found in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook, especially Part 651 - Agriculture Waste Management Field Handbook.  

Irrigation System services include preparing designs, performing construction layouts and construction checks of Contractor’s work and completing final checks of completed construction for individual landowner/operator irrigation systems.  Individual irrigation projects may involve a combination of conservation practices such as: sprinkler systems with hand lines, wheel lines, linear-move, and/or center pivots, pipelines, pumping plants, irrigation regulating reservoirs and structures for water control; micro irrigation systems and surface irrigation system components.

Runoff/Erosion Control Practices development services include preparing designs, performing construction layouts and construction checks of Contractor’s work and completing final checks of completed construction for individual landowner/operator practices.  Individual projects may involve grassed waterways, water and sediment control basins, grade stabilization structures, underground outlets and sediment basins.

Task orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and/or environmental engineering services and other services as needed.  Services requested may require performing (1) field investigations; (2) engineering surveys; (3) soils investigations; (4) preparation of the nutrient management component of a CNMP; and other activities, in accordance with NRCS National and NRCS Idaho standards, specifications, policy, handbooks and documentation requirements as set forth in the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide, National Engineering Handbook, and other related references.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with Microsoft Consulting Services, Washington, D.C., to support the migration of the present Windows environment to Windows 2003 for HQ USSOCOM at MacDill AFB, Florida.  The command’s and subordinate units' local area networks are 100% Microsoft Windows operating system environments and use a wide variety of Microsoft products, many of which have been specifically designed, customized, configured and integrated by Microsoft to support USSOCOM requirements.  Access to and knowledge of Microsoft’s proprietary technical data, Microsoft’s software source codes, Microsoft’s programming resources, and Microsoft’s past and future product technology/development and experiences are required.  MacDill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to Microsoft under the authority of FAR 6.302-1—only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Additionally, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) applies, i.e., a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and an unacceptable delay would result in not continuing the provision of these highly specialized services from Microsoft.

The Government is anticipating a firm fixed price award for this solicitation. Statement of Work for – Organizing, Conducting, and Further Developing the Interagency Trade Officer Training Program Background The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is an interagency task force, chaired by the Department of Commerce.  It was created in 1992 to coordinate the export promotion and export finance activities of the U.S. Government.  One of the chief duties of the TPCC is to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses.  The TPCC’s 2002 National Export Strategy Report to Congress called on the trade promotion agencies to develop a training program to improve customer service by strengthening interagency cooperation and client management.  Research indicated that customer service would improve if trade promotion staff in each agency had a more sophisticated understanding of the programs of other agencies and how they interrelate.  In 2003, the TPCC responded with the pilot Interagency Trade Officer Training Program.  Three sessions were conducted with the full-time support of a senior officer of the Commercial Service (on temporary assignment to the TPCC) and the services of a contractor.  In 2004, the TPCC retained a full-service contractor to further develop the program and organize and conduct three training sessions.   With very positive feedback and continued demand from participating agencies, the TPCC plans to continue this training initiative.  Work Description  The TPCC is seeking proposals for the organization, conduct and ongoing development of the training program.  The period of performance is 12 months with two additional 12 month option periods.  Within 12 months there shall be three training sessions conducted by the contractor.  The duration of each session is approximately four days.   In 2005, the three sessions shall be conducted sometime in March/April (first session), May/June (second session), and September (third session).  Specific dates have yet to be set.  The purpose of this work is to prepare the next generation of international trade officers to accurately and holistically gauge their customers’ real needs in relation to the full array of federal export promotion programs and services available.  Course content must give participants a clear understanding of:  Impact of the competitive business environment on the customer service needs of U.S. companies (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) 1. Best practices government can apply to create higher customer value across agencies; 2.  Trade promotion counseling and marketing programs across the federal government;   3.  Federal information and IT resources available to U.S. businesses;  4. Trade finance issues and federal trade finance services and solutions;  5. Advocacy, market access and trade compliance services of the federal government;  6.  Other government programs that impact U.S. exporters and their competitiveness (e.g., export controls).  Deliverables   In order to achieve the desired level of interagency staff expertise and understanding, this work requires the following deliverables:  1.  Developing a four-day curriculum based on the course content above no later than three weeks after award.  2.  Recruiting and scheduling qualified presenters from throughout government and the private sector.  3.  Coaching presenters from each agency to address TPCC themes, e.g., clean hand-offs/referrals of clients between agencies, strategic coordination between agencies.  4.  Preparation of briefing books and course material CDs for each participant (30-40 per session, 90-120 per year).  5.  Development of multiple interactive exercises, including at least two real-world case studies that bring in U.S. company representatives to work with break out groups (2-4 business reps per session).  6.  Comprehensive evaluation/review of the program with the participants, including full feedback reports to the TPCC no later than one week after conclusion of each session.  7.  Ongoing development of the curriculum and agenda to reflect changes in the business environment and in government programs.

Offers must submit three Past Performances for work provided for  services similar size and scope to this solicitation.  Each reference must include name, address, and telephone number of each point of contact and the dollar value. Discussion with offeror may be conducted to allow the Government to fully explore the proposal.  The offeror shall submit a separate price proposal using the following format, base year CLIN 001 FY05 Training Program, option year 1 CLIN 1001 FY06 Training Program, option year 2 CLIN 2001 FY07 Training Program.

<DESC>Amendment 3:  QUESTIONS FOR CABLE ASSEMBLIES 

1. Does each cable have 2 male SMA Plugs, or just 1?  If only 1, how is the end without the connector to be finished? 

2. For the 18 GHz cable: what VSWR is required, what loss is required, what attenuation is required, is there any average power requirement, and finally, will the cable be used indoors or outdoors? 

3. What type/kind of testing will the cables be used for?
 
ANSWERS TO ABOVE QUESTIONS 

1.  The cables must be 100% compatible with Gore part # G6R01R01240.0 and G6R01R01600.0. 

2.  The salient characteristics of these cables are as follows: 
 
Gore G6 type cable (complete details can be found on the gore web site), which is a low loss RF coaxial cable assembly.
R01 = SMA plug (M) on each end (that's why the P/N shows G6, R01, R01). 240.0 = length in inches, 240 inches = 20'
Frequency of operation = 2-18 GHz. Insertion loss must be .2 dB/ft @ 10 GHz. or less (note that is point 2 i.e. 2/10th of a dB per foot). For a 20' cable this is 4.0 dB.
Max. diameter of cable = .29"
Qnty = 8 ea.
 
Same parameters for G6R01R01600.0: except the cable length is 600" = 50'. Qnty = 8ea. Max insertion loss for the 50' cable = 10dB (@10 GHz.)
 
The cables do not have to be phase matched, but any cable other than the Gore must include measured performance to demonstrate equivalent spec. compliance.  Insertion loss is the most critical performance spec for this requirement as well as the max cable diameter.
