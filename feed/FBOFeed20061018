<ARCHDATE>10182007
<CONTACT>Barbara Taylor Contract Specialist 8015243750 ;
<DESC>This requirement was previously announced under Solicitation No. 07SP408172. The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a construction contract to overlay the Deer Creek Dam Spillway Chute with a reinforced concrete slab.  The requirement is being procured in accordance with Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations as a Request for Proposals. Deer Creek Dam is a zoned earth and rockfill embankment with a structural height of 235 feet and a crest length of 1,304 feet.  It impounds the 152,700 acre Deer Creek Reservoir, a source of culinary, municipal, and irrigation water for both Salt Lake and Utah Counties.  The dam's 700-foot long reinforced concrete spillway is located on the right abutment and is controlled by two 21-foot wide by 20-foot high radial gates. The principal features of the work include the following: 1.  Construction of a reinforced concrete overlay within the spillway chute. 2.  Installation of grouted anchors and dowels in the chute floor slabs and walls. 3.  Installation of hydrophilic and PVC waterstops at concrete joints. 4.  Preparation of existing concrete surfaces to accept concrete overlay. 5.  Removal of existing concrete at upstream and downstream ends of overlay. 6.  Unwatering spillway chute and stilling basin to allow placement of concrete overlay. 7.  Construct and remove downstream cofferdam.  Cleaning and removal of debris from stilling basin. Critical items of work include placing a large quantity of concrete to strict Reclamation standards, and effectively removing seepage water from the stilling basin.   While Reclamation plans to award the contract in January of 2007, the actual work will be performed between June (immediately following spring runoff) and October of 2007. A site tour has been scheduled for November 15, 2006 at 10:00 a.m.  All interested parties shall meet at the bottom of the spillway.  The solicitation will be issued November 3, 2006 with further information on the site tour. This requirement falls within the estimated price range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The work will be performed under NAICS Code 238110, and is being solicited under full and open competition.  Please contact Estephanie Singleton (801) 524-3693 or e-mail esingleton@uc.usbr.gov to obtain a CD of the Drawings for this requirement. Prospective vendors must be registered in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<RESPDATE>101807
<ARCHDATE>11162007
<CONTACT>Annette  Harkless, (405)  954-8925
<DESC>The FAA intends to issue a contract to provide technical support services to the Financial Analysis & Process Reengineering Team (AJF4) located in Washington, DC.  The Financial Analysis & Process Reengineering Team assists the Senior Vice President of Finance for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) in establishing policies, planning, and providing analysis on a variety of programs; i.e., human resource management, labor/management relations, and air traffic work force staffing.  They provide technical expertise in the development, revision, revalidation, and application of engineered staffing standards and staffing guidelines for the Enroute and Terminal Service Units within ATO. Staffing standards are planning tools consisting of mathematical models that are used to compute the number of persons required to perform a job or set of tasks.  They are developed using industrial engineering techniques, statistics, and operations research analysis.  FAA standards include appropriate allowances for leave, training, travel, etc. needed to accomplish a function. Periodic updates to the formulas are necessary to ensure the standards reflect current activities and resources.  At present, the work measurement formulas used in the current air traffic control staffing standards, were last updated in the early 1990's.  The resultant contract will be a follow-on to an existing contract currently awarded to a small business.  This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA Certified 8(a) and Small Business concerns.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of furnishing all personnel, materials, equipment and services necessary to provide technical support services to the Financial Analysis & Process Reengineering Team by analyzing staffing standards, guidelines, and work environments within the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) to update existing work measurement formulas to reflect current and future staffing requirements.  ATO facilities may include Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), Tower Cabs, or Terminal Radar Approach Control Centers (TRACON).  Work associated with this effort will involve gathering new or existing data, analyzing the data, producing all required reports, and updating appropriate software applications.  The contractor will develop new models and formulas and/or revise old ones using data collected at a sample of facilities and formulate the data into a software application.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other Small Business competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611, with a size standard of $6.0 Million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(a) Certification letter (if applicable).  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA SEDB 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey MAY result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.   Tasks and services that must be provided include the following:  Task Area 1:   Develop staffing standards, guidelines, models, and formulas specifically engineered for FAA's air traffic controller workforce.  Typical tasks will include and not be limited to some or all of the following:          1.1  	Orientation -The contractor shall meet with AJF4, the program office, and the proper line of business representative to receive an overview of activities covered by the staffing standard models, to establish which components of the workforce will be analyzed.  If requested by the COTR, the contractor shall attend a one-day orientation at local FAA facilities to receive an overview of the program activities for the facilities type to be analyzed.  The contractor shall familiarize itself with all studies, reports or other documents relating to the existing staffing standards, guidelines, or models for these facilities.  All information gathered will be used to define the project's scope and direction.  The contractor will develop and document an understanding of each organization, and its personnel requirement needed to support the organization's mission. 	1.2  	Review Existing Historical Files, Reports, and Standards - The contractor will review historical files, reports, models, and existing staffing standards to gain an understanding of the work to be accomplished.  All available workload data will be identified, including existing staffing standards or models, to examine how they were developed and maintained. 	1.3	Accomplishment Plan - The contractor will develop a plan to assess the air traffic control work environment(s) and collect work measurement and workload (traffic activity) data from each facility type being studied.  This plan will address on-site data collection guidelines and instructions for data collection personnel.   A plan of action will be prepared by the contractor, and submitted for each facility or cluster of facility type scheduled to be analyzed.  The plan shall outline the steps required to complete each task and include the estimated number of labor hours, by category,  used to complete each step.   	1.4	Utilize Current Business Practices - When necessary, the contractor shall at their own expense, obtain advice and information from subject matter experts to enable them to remain current on the latest business practices, methodologies, and etc. being used to develop staffing standards and models. The contractor shall research literature to identify techniques, methodologies, best practices, models, and etc. that may be available to establish the staffing model requirements. 	1.5	Analyze Information - The contractor shall analyze information from the previous paragraphs to develop a framework for the staffing standards, guidelines, or models. The framework will detail how standards or models should be developed to fulfill the organization's requirements. 	1.6	Develop Data Collection Plan - The contractor will develop a plan for collecting data. The plan will include how data will be collected, onsite data collection guidelines, and provide instructions for data collection personnel.  In addition, the contractor shall: 		-  Collect data using surveys, interview techniques, time study, work sampling and/or other industrial engineering or operations research analysis techniques.  		-  Discuss with FAA representatives, relevant functions, tasks, methods to measure or estimate time, and task frequency.  		-  Develop/modify task lists and identify data required to develop and/or validate time and frequency.  		-  Determine the potential workload drivers necessary to develop mathematical equations, formulas, etc., for each task being measured. 		-  Provide suggestions of possible site selections to ensure facility variations are addressed. The primary requirement for sites selected for data collection is that they are a true representation of the population to which the staffing standards or models will be applied.  		-  Design a statistical sampling plan to obtain desired accuracy of staffing standards  		formulas.  Other factors determining site locations may also be established by AJF4 and the program office. 		-  Meet with the FAA to determine if modifications to the data collection plan should be made, before data collection begins. 	1.7	Perform Data Collection - Using the information and methods developed above, the contractor shall arrange travel to various regions, field offices and other FAA facilities in order to collect data as specified in the approved data collection plan.  Data will be collected by examining existing office records and interviewing appropriate FAA headquarter, region and field personnel.  Methods for data collection shall include but not be limited to using time study, work measurement, work sampling, other industrial engineering or operation research analysis techniques.  Additional data used for the formulas shall be statistically significant and feasible to collect. Data will be collected from some or all of the facilities identified in Attachment 1.  The collection will be conducted over a suitable period of time coordinated with the COTR, and based on the sample size appropriate for the number of experienced employees and active positions at each location.  Data collection will include the days of the week which typically have the highest activity level and may cover all active functions at each site.  Detailed workload data and other relevant information will also be collected.  The collection will include information from previous studies and any information deemed pertinent by the FAA.  A FAA representative will accompany the contractor to each site to facilitate data collection and act as a liaison between the contractor and Government personnel on site.   The contractor will investigate workload data from existing records and computer systems, and obtain sample data for the time period covered by the data collection.  Information needed to determine improvements or changes to the staffing standards will be collected as appropriate. 	1.8	Analyze Data - The contractor shall compile and analyze the information and data collected, and provide statistical expertise as needed.  The data will be analyzed to examine, but not be limited to, regression formulas, scheduling models, and the following determinations: 		-  trends, patterns, correlations, etc. existing between observed work and workload measurements.  		-  identify appropriate staffing models or factors relating staffing to workload indicators, such as traffic activity. 		-  whether facilities may be "clustered" to obtain better statistical results. 		-  significant differences with previously collected data. Data collected data will be combined into a database for analysis.  The analysis shall include computation of all staffing standards and work time formulas.  Data used for the formulas shall be statistically significant and feasible to collect. Additionally, the contractor shall recommend work models or further analysis to be conducted and obtain FAA review and approval for each step of data analysis. 	1.9	Validate the Proposed Standards - The contractor shall devise a comprehensive method to validate both existing and proposed staffing standards formulas.  This should include, but not be limited to comparing the staffing standards results with existing staffing levels. 	1.10	Develop Computerized Scheduling Models - The contractor should become familiar with current computer scheduling models used by the FAA and make changes or adjustments to the models as needed.  	1.11	Develop Staffing Standards, Models, and Guidelines - To obtain accurate results, the contractor will either develop new staffing standards, models, and update existing guidelines, or revise and replace the current staffing standards and models.  Changes to all parameters and allowances shall be made so the final staffing standards, models, or guidelines reflect the work performed, and ensure none of the work is "double counted." 	1.12	Staffing Standards Software System - When necessary, developments or modifications to the staffing standards application system shall be made to incorporate all new and revised equations or allowances for usage on a FAA designated computer.  All new and updated data must interface with the existing software.  Revised software systems shall be furnished on CD for easy installation and the contractor shall install the revised system on a FAA computer as directed by the COTR. 	1.13	Apply Staffing Standards, Models, Guidelines -The contractor shall update all staffing standards, input variables, and apply the resultant staffing standards using the new formulas and data for evaluation. When required, a reproducible and audible sensitivity analysis must accommodate the staffing standards.  Any requirement generated by the staffing standards or models must be reproducible, thoroughly documented, and acceptable to the FAA. 	1.14	Staffing Standards, Models, or Guidelines Validation and Discussion - The contractor will determine a reasonable method to validate staffing standards, models, or guidelines, to conduct the required validation analyses.  Developed staffing standards, models, guidelines and their implementation shall be discussed with the FAA.  Based on these discussions, the contractor may be required to make revisions prior to being accepted by the FAA. This process may be repeated as necessary. 	1.15	Prepare Documentation - The contractor shall prepare and submit a complete and thorough technical report by hard copy and electronic medium.  All user manuals and documentation for all software provided, shall be submitted in the same manner.  The report should include a complete and thorough documentation of the processes used to develop the staffing standards,  from orientation to the data collection process, through data analysis.  The results shall be presented with formulas requiring only current available data or formulas requiring additional information should the data be found significant.  The formulas impact on staffing figures shall be discussed with the FAA.  Based upon these discussions, the contractor may be required to modify or refine their analysis to reapply the standards before the results are acceptable.  Upon completion, the FAA will be allowed ample time to thoroughly review the report prior to it being finalized for distribution. 	1.16	Briefings - When required, the contractor shall present the standards, models, or guidelines to FAA management.  Task Area 2:   	This task includes analyzing FAA's workforce by contrasting work and workloads, examining workforce scheduling models and database systems used to apply staffing standards, and analyzing staffing issues such as overtime usage, alternate work schedules, facility consolidation, and the impact of proposed changes in equipment and procedures.   	2.1	Orientation -The contractor shall meet with AJF4 representatives to clarify the project requirement.  AJF4 representatives will review the problem(s) to be analyzed and define the contractor's role.  The contractor's role will consist of either conducting the entire analysis, or assisting with a specific portion of it.  If requested by the COTR, the contractor shall attend a one-day orientation at local FAA facilities for an overview on the programmed activities for the facilities scheduled to be analyzed.   	2.2	Data Collection - Data will be collected from some or all of the facilities to be identified. The collection will include information from previous studies and any information deemed pertinent by the FAA.    	2.3	Data Analysis - All collected data should be combined into a database and analyzed.  The analysis shall include computation of all staffing standards work time formulas.  Data used for the formulas shall be statistically significant and feasible to collect.  Once data to be analyzed has been determined, the contractor shall analyze the data using the levels below: 		Input or Raw Data Level:   This data could be time study data or data collected from several regions.  An example of this type of analysis would be determining the impact of a 30% decrease in staff on work accomplished by instituting a new work procedure or changing the way a work element is completed. 		Sensitivity Level:   An example of sensitivity analyses may include the following: 		- Air traffic staffing standards currently provide staffing to cover the 90th percentile of the busiest day of the year.  An analysis project would look at staffing for the 50th, 80th, or 95th percentile of the busiest day of the year. 		-  Air traffic terminal staffing standards use an availability factor of 1.76 that covers leave, training, and off position activities.  How much does staffing change if the availability factor is increased or decreased? 		- An analysis to determine how much time controllers spend processing flight strips in TRACON facilities. 		- An analysis to determine the impact of staffing if TMC and/or supervisory and overhead staffing guidelines are changed. 		- An analysis to determine the impact to staffing if 2 controllers are required to work the midnight shift. 		Scheduling Level:  An example of a scheduling level analysis would be to change the number of shifts, length of shifts, periods per lunch break, scheduling of lunches or breaks, and alternate work schedules. 	2.4	Determine the Impact of Data Analysis On Staffing Standards - After data has been analyzed, the contractor will modify the staffing standards as necessary to determine how the data will effect staffing requirements.  The contractor will run new standards from the results of the data analysis, and compare the original staffing standards with the new scenario.  A comprehensive method to validate both the existing and proposed staffing standards formulas shall also be developed by the contractor.   	2.5	Staffing Standards Software System - When necessary, developments or modifications to the staffing standards application system shall be made to incorporate all revised and new equations or allowances for usage on a FAA designated computer.  All new and updated data must interface with the existing software.  Revised software systems shall be furnished on CD for easy installation and the contractor shall install the revised system on a FAA computer as directed by the COTR.  	2.6	Prepare Documentation - The contractor shall prepare and submit a complete and thorough technical report by hard copy and electronic medium.  The contractor will provide a written report on the results of the analysis and their potential impact if implemented.  The report should include a complete and thorough documentation of the processes used during data collection, analyzing staffing issues and applying the staffing standards.  The results shall be presented in formulas using the data currently available, or formulas requiring additional information should the data be found significant.  The impact of the formulas on staffing figures shall be discussed with the FAA.  Based upon these discussions, the contractor may be required to modify or refine their analysis to reapply the standards before the results are acceptable.  Upon completion, the FAA will be allowed ample time to thoroughly review the report prior to it being finalized for distribution. The FAA intends to have any resultant contract in place by December 31, 2006.  The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month base period, with up to four (4) 12-month options.

Section K?(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.  All Offerors must acknowledgment all amendments if any.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Specification, Past Performance, and price.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole-source contract to MacGregor (USA) Inc., 14 Ridgedale Ave, Suite 205, Cedar Knolls, NJ 07927-1106 (RFP N00024-07-R-2214) for the development and production of a prototype side port ramp for the Maritime Pre-positioning Force (Future) (MPF(F)) Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) with an integrated side port platform for the MPF(F) Large Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR).  The effort will include technology development and testing of one new MLP side port ramp integrated with the side port platforms for the MPF(F) LMSR and existing Army LMSRs.  The MLP Ramp and LMSR Platform will be an extension of new technologies using the existing stern ramp system from the Military Sealift Command’s T-AKR Class (LMSR).  The design concept will facilitate the transfer of vehicles between the Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) and existing and future LMSRs.  The design will consist of a smaller version of the Army LMSR’s stern ramp mounted !  on the starboard side of the MLP, which will be deployed to a new platform that folds out from the port side of the LMSR. The system will operate through sea-state 3 conditions with a maximum load capacity 160,000 pounds.  The design will employ a dynamic positioning system to maintain proper spacing and fore/aft alignment between the two ships  while steaming ahead at 3-5 knots.  The new side platform will be about 48 feet wide and 56 feet long which will be larger than the existing LMSR side platform while still stowing with the same side shell recess and mounts. When deployed, the platform will be angled about 5 degrees below horizontal supported by hinged links at the fore and aft ends.  The MLP ramp and LMSR platform will require detailed knowledge and familiarity with critical technical details, design, configuration, and performance characteristics of previously produced ramps and doors.   In addition, commonality with existing (Army) LMSR ships is essential.  MacGre!  gor USA is the only company maintaining the necessary familiarity with  prior LMSR ramp/door designs; design systems; and, production processes to successfully execute this effort.  Therefore, MacGregor USA is deemed the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Government’s requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact MacGregor USA directly as follows: POC: Jeffrey Siegel (jeff.siegel@macgregor-group.com), (973) 285-7874 (office), (914) 439-3662 (cell), (973) 285-7861 (fax)..

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command issued Solicitation N00024-06-R-3207 for Information Assurance (IA) support services through Seaport-e in March 2006.  Due to the reason that the government?s requirement can not be clearly defined it has been determined that awarding through Seaport-e as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) with Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) options will not meet the needs of the government.  Therefore, Solicitation N00024-06-R-3207 is hereby cancelled through Seaport-e in its entirety and readvertised.  

This performance based requirement will be competitively resolicited as a small business set-aside and awarded as a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP), Level of Effort (LOE) delivery order contract for the base year with four option years. The new solicitation number is N00421-07-R-0005.

<CONTACT>Clarence Campbell 850-234-4853  , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source contract to WS Darley and Company for the procurement of 800 each mufflers for the P-100 Pump, p/n 1220901.  The P-100 pump is a critical piece of firefighter’s damage control equipment.  The P-100 pump is used aboard U.S. Navy ships during de-watering to prevent massive loss of lives.  The P-100 pump is also used aboard U.S. Navy ships to provide high-pressure water for damage control/fire fighting equipment. Without the high-pressure water, small easily contained fires can escalate and become catastrophic to U.S. Navy Ships.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  NAVSEA Certification for damage control equipment consists of a strenuous review of both the equipment (including technical documentation, engineering drawings, material use, etc.) and the manufacturer (including manufacturing processes, cleaning procedures, quality assurance, etc.).  The P-100 pump man!  ufactured by WS Darley and Company is the only pump approved for use with Shipboard Firefighters/Damage Control Equipment.  Therefore WS Darley and Company is the only company that can accurately manufacture the mufflers for the P-100 pump. A firm-fixed-price contract is anticipated. Award will be based on the written proposal. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity-Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Anticipated award date will be on or about December 19, 2006.  NAICS Code 333911 applies. FSC is 4320. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to National Technical Systems (NTS), 1701 E. Plano Parkway, Suite 150, Plano, Texas, to provide Carriage, Stream, Tow and Recovery System (CSTRS) environmental testing support.  CSTRS is designed to interface Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) sensor/weapons to the MH-60S aircraft in performing mine detection and neutralization.  CSTRS provides an interface and physical connection between the MH-60S Aircraft and the Airborne Mine Countermeasures Sensor systems for performance of the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) mission from an MH-60S aircraft.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Under this effort, NTS will conduct an array of CSTRS environmental testing including: Vibration, Shock, Bench Handling, Temperature, Temperature Shock, Altitude, Waterproofness, Icing, Humidity, Sand and Dust, Explosive Atmosphere, and EMI.  These tests require!   a myriad of expansive test facilities and experienced test personnel.  Due to the size, weight, footprint, and operating environment of the CSTRS system, NTS is the only company that can complete all of the required environmental testing.  Use of multiple companies to complete the various parts of the environmental testing may introduce new or change existing parameters that may be harmful to the CSTRS system.  Therefore, it is imperative that the task is awarded to NTS to complete all of the CSTRS environmental testing.  NAICS Code is 541380, FSC Code is H215, SBA size standard is $11.0M.  Questions concerning this solicitation can be emailed to Stacy Figlinski at Stacy.Figlinski@navy.mil.

Box 7909,Raleigh, NC 27695 to provide elemental analyses by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) Gamma Spectrometry.  North Carolina State University, provides non-destructive elemental analyses of environmental and biological samples by neutron activation analysis that are needed as part of an ongoing study of the bioavailability of metalloids (e.g., arsenic) and metals (e.g., cadmium) in soil samples. Two factors justify the request for processing without full and open competition.  First, analytical work to be performed under this Request for Professional Services is a continuation of work performed by US EPA investigators using Nuclear Energy Services, Department of Nuclear Engineering, North Carolina State University, as the provider of neutron activation analysis services.  Service from the same laboratory will ensure consistency and comparability of data. EPA believes that the North Carolina State University, is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirements.  Nuclear Energy Services, Department of Nuclear Engineering, North Carolina State University, has successfully handled this type of time-sensitive biological sample in earlier work for investigators from the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, demonstrating the value of physical proximity and their expertise in handling this type of sample.    The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The period of performance for the service contract is expected to be twenty-four (24) months from date of award.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities, qualifications, and how they would be useful to perform the proposed requirement in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit any responses to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: James E. Wesley (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The following modification is issued to this announcement: The location of the work described herein will be performed at the contractor's office.  The engineer supervising the work is located at Los Alamos national Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico.

Brookhaven Science Associates is seeking a firm to provide system engineering design services for the PHENIX VTX Project.   The project scope is as follows:  design and fabricate the mechanical support structure and cooling system of the Silicon Vertex Detector (VTX) for the PHENIX Experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. The VTX is a compact device, approximately cylindrical in shape with an outer radius of 20 cm and a length of 80 cm. The VTX has three main components, a central barrel containing four layers of silicon sensors (both silicon strips and pixels) with approximately 4.3 million sensor channels and associated electronics plus two end caps with four strip layers each and approximately 1.3 million sensor channels and associated electronics.   This project covers engineering services for only the central barrel. The frames supporting the VTX sensors and electronics must be of high stiffness but low mass and low density, composed primarily of carbon composite materials to allow a maximum 100 micron deflection under gravity of any component of the VTX mechanical system. The VTX must have an associated cooling system that is capable of removing up to 4000 Watts of heat from the device. The operating temperature of the device will be 0o Celsius. Together the mechanical and cooling system must add no more than 3.2% of a radiation length to the total average thickness of the detector.

 The firm performing this job must have experience working with large channel count, silicon sensor detector systems for particle physics and space-based experiments. They must have a demonstrated track-record of design of mechanical support, cooling and alignment systems with micron-level precision and multi-project experience designing and prototyping carbon composite-based low mass mechanical support systems. The firm must also have significant experience working on advanced technology mechanical engineering projects that would be obtained from past experience working with federal agencies such as the US Department of Energy and NASA. This project will require weekly interaction and close coordination with engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, NM.

The required services to be provided are:  engineering and design, and manufacturing liaison.  All work and deliverables shall be stamped and sealed by Registered Professionals. It is expected that the resultant work may include services in the following areas:  Title I Services:  Services in this category may include preliminary research and development.  Title II Services:  Services in this category may include definitive design of all required preliminary and final working drawings, specifications, detailed cost estimates, and fabrication schedules.  Title III Services:  Services in this category may include review and approval of tooling, fabrication methods and materials, and preparation of record drawings (reproducible) showing fabrication work as actually accomplished (as-built drawings).

Incidental services are:  AutoCAD drafting, word processing, cost estimating, etc. may be required in the performance of this requirement.

Project Location:  Project supervision from Los Alamos, New Mexico.


LICENSING:  Where applicable, the listed disciplines shall be licensed/registered to practice in the state in which the company is located.
 
Selection/Evaluation/Award Process:  Selection Process:  Selection and award will be completed in three phases as follows:  Phase I:  a) interested firms shall submit their qualifications to perform the services noted above.  b) An evaluation panel will evaluate each company?s qualifications in terms of the evaluation criteria noted above.

During the interview the firms will present their qualifications.  Presentations shall address each of the evaluation criteria.  b) based upon the information obtained during the interview process, the evaluation panel will provide to the Procurement Official a final selection list which states in order of preference the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Phase III:  a) The Procurement Official will issue a Request For Proposal to the highest ranked firm.  b) The firm shall prepare and submit a proposal.  The proposal shall include unit pricing for the stated services as well as a subcontracting plan if applicable.  c)  Brookhaven Science Associates and the firm shall attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory contract.  If a contract cannot be negotiated, the Procurement Official shall initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selection list.  This procedure shall be continued until a mutually satisfactory contract has been negotiated.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation and selection of the firm will be based on the following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance:

<DESC>Questions and Answers 

1.	Is cover page and table of contents counted in the 20 pages?  

Answer ? No, the 20 page limit does not include the Cover page and Table of Contents


2.	If a prime intends to ultimately propose subcontractors, is the response to the sources sought intended to only represent the Prime?s experience or the team?s experience?

Answer - The response should be  "Turn Key" effort response - that is the Primes' total experience in being able to satisfy the requirements.


3.	Should all subcontractors reply to the sources sought?  In other words, if a potential subcontractor does not reply to the sources sought, does that prevent that firm from being a subcontractor?

Answer - No, the response should be from the prime contractors.  One team - one response.   A primes' ability or lack of ability to "field" the subcontractors at solicitation is something that will be considered during the RFP evaluations


4.	Does the 20-page limit on the Sources Sought response include page allocations for resumes?

Answer ? No,  the 20 page limit does not include the resumes.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions submitted by potential offerors.  Q1.  Technical Factor B and associated sentence in the Description:  Question:  The unit we would like to propose will not conduct direct testing of the functions listed, but rather indirect testing of these functions, through electrical control.  Is this an acceptable means, so long as the user is provided with enough information to ascertain the proper functioning of these items?  We know of no electronic shifter that directly controls these functions.  RESPONSE:  This is considered an acceptable means. Q2.  Technical Factor C and associated sentence in the Description:  Question:  The Voltage is whatever the voltage the vehicle is putting out.  There is no control over this parameter.  If the system in the vehicle is over or under, it is what it is and the equipment on the vehicle must operate at that voltage, therefore we do not verify this.  We do not directly monitor and display ECU Amps and Ohms parameters, but use LED displays to indicate this information.   The  patented technology tests the solenoids during operation and the user is not required to monitor or measure these specifications.  Is this acceptable?   RESPONSE:  Main vehicle power is 24VDC.  Transmission components operate at 12VDC.  Tester must NOT allow/provide 24V onto transmission systems.  Self test must provide for indication of proper operation of tester.  Vehicle power accuracy is NOT a responsibility of the test system.  Accurate readings of transmission components is however a responsibility of t!  he test system.  LED displays are NOT considered acceptable means of verifying accuracy of transmission components.  The user requires the capability of verifying and displaying these parameters.  The response date and time remains unchanged.  All proposals must be submitted to the following address:  Commanding General, marine Corps Systems Command, Attn:  Ms. Wendy Stevenson, CTQ3WS, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050, or electronically at wendy.stevenson@usmc.mil no later than 2:00 PM local standard time, October 19, 2006.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change sentence #9 to read, "Successful offerors will have approximately 18 months to design, fabricate and test a vehicle mounted system." The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a vehicle mounted (mounted) CREW (3.2) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 18 months to design, fabricate and test a vehicle mounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately seven months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on bot!  h the east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 vehicle mounted CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential small business sources that could function as the prime contractor for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contract.  Interested parties are hereby requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).
NAVAIR deployed its enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, Sigma, in October 2002 and has been in the operations and support (O&S) phase of the program since that time.  PMA 203 provides functional O&S support for the Sigma ERP deployed solution at NAVAIR under the guidance of a Government/integrator team.  O&S tasks are typically accomplished through integrated product or project teams, comprised of Government and contractor personnel, supporting business areas such as financial, procurement, human resources, and other elements of the NAVAIR Sigma solution. Sigma is scheduled to transition to Navy ERP in October 2007 with full retirement in December 2007.  As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, NAVAIR will establish a Business Office that will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise and provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters. 

This contract will provide support for continued O&S performance of the Sigma system, NAVAIR Navy ERP implementation efforts, and the establishment of the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The Government views these primary tasks as a three-phased approach of distinct yet interrelated efforts resulting in an overlap of one task area within the next.  Support areas required for each effort is outlined below:
	
	1) Sigma Operations and Support
The goal of this phase is to provide continued sustainment levels of operational support through close-out of the Sigma ERP system.  In performance of this phase, the contractor shall support NAVAIR business processes as deployed in Sigma, maintain data integrity of the system, identify and resolve any issues, and complete requirements for external mandates.  O&S will continue to be fully operational up until one month after Navy ERP Go-Live with a final Annual Close for FY07 conducted within the operational period.  In this phase, the contractor shall perform services in areas such as testing, configuration management, requirements management, functional support, analysis, and role management under the guidance of the government/integrator team.  Mandated system changes and deficiencies will require analysis, requirements and solution development, testing and implementation.  The contractor shall also support the Customer Support Center (CSC) which provides services to NAVAIR by providing communications and liaison between Sigma ERP and internal and external customers and organizations and by disseminating information regarding Sigma ERP via multiple venues.   The CSC also supports resolution of customer issues through its Help Desk and Role Management activities, updating of ERP website information, and compiling metrics to gauge.

2) NAVAIR Navy ERP Implementation
The goal of this phase is to serve as the focal point for successful Navy ERP Implementation at NAVAIR.  To achieve this goal, support shall be required for the transition from the Sigma ERP System to the Navy ERP system in the areas of change management, data management, test support, and training support across all SAP modules including  FI, FM, CO, MM, PS, SD, HR, WF, IM, AM and BW.  Implementation support is currently on-going and will continue through complete Sigma phase out which is projected to be three months after Navy ERP Go-Live. 

3) NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office
	As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, the primary NAVAIR interaction with Navy ERP regarding their deployed NAVAIR solution will be through the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The goal of the Business Office will be to serve as the NAVAIR center of excellence for Navy ERP business operations and functional process sustainment.  Additionally, the Business Office will minimize impact of Navy ERP deployment and implementation on current and new users.  The Business Office will provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters, ensure that business process and technical areas are in sync, and will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise.  All NAVAIR requirements for Navy ERP, to include deficiencies, will be processed and prioritized through this organization to represent the NAVAIR Process Owner needs.  The Business Office will be responsible for key stakeholder coordination, business and functional process management, deficiency identification, data management and reporting, user and role management, sustainment training management, customer advocacy, and liaison with the Navy ERP Program Management Office (PMO).  In addition, the Business Office will provide strategic recommendations to the NAVAIR leadership on the health, business operations, and recommendations for improvement based on the data obtained from the Navy ERP system.  The NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office will officially stand up at Navy ERP Go-Live which is projected for 1 October 2007 and remain in effect indefinitely.  The contractor shall support the following efforts: testing, quality assurance, training, data management, reporting, system deficiency recognition and resolution, requirements management, business Process Owner support and project management support.  The contractor shall also provide customer support for NAVAIR.
Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  The Government will not be responsible for SOC preparation costs.  Submissions should be electronically in a MS Office compatible format to yarinee.tafur@navy.mil.  Note that submissions will not be returned.  Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 27 Oct 2006.  Submit any questions by e-mail to yarinee.tafur@navy.mil, no phone calls will be accepted or return.

While displaying the real time data it is also desirable to  simultaneously view data from an earlier survey on the real time display. This will  ensure that data gathered is compatible and comparable with existing data sets that are  available within the District. Edited Single beam Data   Processed single beam data will conform to the ONSITE  ASCII text format. The data will be tide corrected and clean of anomalous soundings.  Profiles may be plotted referenced to the channel design and will show the end areas  for each template change of the channel. The data may also be plotted to a standard  bathymetric chart individual soundings in plan view.  The processed data files must be  accessible to the Galveston District Survey Data System which reads and displays the  data for use by other users within the District office. Shallow-Water Multibeam Data The AE's Multibeam data format shall provide  complete traceability for all positions, soundings, and correctors including sensor  offsets, biases, dynamic attitude, sound velocity, position, sensor position, date and  time, vertical datum reducers, and sounding data from acquisition through post  processing. Data quality and edit flags must be traceable.  Raw Multibeam Data The AE must be able to submit full resolution Multibeam data in  a format readable by CARIS HIPS (Version 5.3, by CARIS). Full resolution multibeam  data shall be delivered fully corrected for tides, sound velocity, vessel offsets, draft and  settlement and squat. These corrections may be made within CARIS, with data  submitted as a complete CARIS project (including HDCS files, sound velocity files,  Vessel Configuration, CARIS tide files, etc.). Or the data may be submitted fully  corrected, such that it will be read in CARIS HIPS using a 'zeroed' Vessel Configuration  file (.vcf) and a 'zero' tide file (.tid), etc. Full resolution data are defined as all data  acquired and logged during normal survey operations. Information and specifications on  CARIS HIPS and data formats may be obtained from CARIS at 506-458-8533.  Edited Multibeam Data The AE will be required to submit an edited Multibeam data set  in ASCII text format. Edited data are defined as fully corrected data that meet accuracy  and resolution specifications are cleaned of all anomalous soundings, and serve as the  source for all preliminary smooth sheet soundings and sun-illuminated DTM's. Edited  data sets shall contain XYZ, z' (tide corrector), date/time stamp, and a unique identifier  which indicates whether the sounding is depicted on the smooth sheet. Coordinates  (XY) shall be state plane NAD 83, and depth (Z) shall be in feet to nearest 1 tenth of a  foot (fully corrected for tide (MLT datum), sound velocity, dynamic and static draft, and  all vessel offsets). Tide corrector (z') shall be in feet to the nearest tenth. Time shall be  UTC to the nearest second. Data shall be binned, line-by-line, at a bin size not less  than 5 feet + 5 percent of the depth, using shoal biased filtering. All depths shall retain  their survey position and shall not represent the binned area centroid or other abstract  position (i.e. binned, not girded data).  Preliminary Smooth Sheet Data The AE will be required to submit the preliminary  smooth sheet data set in ASCII text format. The smooth sheet data set shall contain  XYZ. Coordinates (XY) shall be state plane NAD83, and Z shall be depth in feet to the  nearest tenth of a foot (fully corrected for tide (MLT datum), sound velocity, dynamic  and static draft, and all vessel offsets).  Specific Multibeam Data The AE will be required to submit raw cross line data and  data used for determining navigation time latency, pitch, roll, and yaw biases on  separate media. Raw main scheme lines, which contain depths over dangers to  navigation, wrecks, rocks or obstructions, shall also be included on separate media.  The data format shall be such that CARIS HIPS can convert the data, thus making it  compatible as described herein above.  Side Scan Sonar Data The AE will be required to submit digital side scan data in a  format readable by CARIS SIPS (version 5.3). Digital side scan sonar shall be geo- coded using the tow fish position. Information and specifications on CARIS SIPS and  data formats may be obtained from CARIS. Side Scan Contact Images The AE will be required to submit digital images of all  significant side scan contacts within the contact list. Digital images shall be in a  standard image format (e.g., .tif, .gif, .jpg). The file name shall coincide with the contact  name as depicted on the contact list.  Side Scan Mosaics The AE will be required to submit a digital image file for each 100  percent coverage. The digital image file shall be in a standard geo-referenced image  format.  Tide and Sound Velocity  Data The AE will be required to submit tide data and sound  velocity data applied to all Multibeam depths on CD ROM or on the project data tapes.  The hydrographer shall identify spreadsheet file; date/time referenced to UTC, tide relative to MLT datum to the nearest tenth of a foot.  Vessel Configuration File The AE will be required to submit a CARIS compatible Vessel Configuration file (VCF) for each vessel used during survey operations. CARIS-compatible VCF shall contain those static and dynamic correctors and offsets, which are to b e applied to the raw Multibeam data set submitted as referenced in Section 8.5.3. Information and specifications on the vessel configuration file format may be obtained from CARIS.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED OF EACH FIRM RESPONDING  - (1) Include the firms ACASS number; (2) List names the firm used in the past three years including parent company, branch offices, affiliates, associates, and subsidiaries; (3) Provide resumes of  the personnel who will be actually performing the work, state their respective function and indicate their experience in that function; (4) Provide information on the proposed CADD systems and how they will be compatible with the Galveston District's Micr oStation PC 05.05.03.55 system; (5) Indicate personnel strength and available equipment. (6) Indicate experience with ONSITE software

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The information received will be used to assess the capability of an air carrier to provide air passenger service from Elmendorf AFB AK to Eareckson Air Station AK.  The air transportation is for jet air transportation services from Elmendorf AFB to Eareckson AFS AK with occasional stops into King Salmon, or other destinations along the route, upon the request of the Government.  Jet aircraft utilized must be capable of transporting a minimum of 15 passengers with baggage up to the aircraft ACL (allowable cabin load).  Contractor aircraft must be fully self-supporting with internal passenger stairs, auxiliary power unit (APU) for self-starting, and an industry standard lavatory equipped with running water and flushing toilet system.  Assume a 3-hour standby at Eareckson AFS.
Please provide the following information and any other information you think might be helpful in the acquisition of this air transportation:  a) Type of aircraft with capabilities (speed, range, etc.); b) Payload of the aircraft; c) Estimated price, or price range, per GCSM; d) Are you a DOD approved carrier?; e) Your business size(large or small); f) Have you flown the aircraft to be offered for 12 continuous months of comparable service or will you have done so by the time of contract award?; g) How is service usually priced and is per-mile acceptable?; Are reimbursables a standard practice? If so, what is paid?; h) Describe your security policy; i) Describe your inspection methods used to ensure satisfactory performance; j) How much advance notice do you require prior to scheduling a flight?; k) What are your policies/charges when user cancels?; l) Describe your liability for loss and/or damage to passenger baggage and/or personal equipment; m) What is the standard commercial practice if the contractor is late for mission or fails to perform?; n) What are customary types and amounts of insurance in the commercial market?; o) Where does billing begin?  When you take off en route to a pickup point, or once you pick up the passengers?; p) Where would your base of operations be located and how long would it take for you to arrive at the pick-up point?;  q) Do you possess a part 135 certificate?;  r) Is there a fee for oversize or excess baggage?; s) How will you take care of passengers in the event of carrier caused mission cancellations or delays?
The government is considering changing the departure point from Elmendorf AFB to Anchorage International Airport.  In this case, the carrier would be required to control/process passengers and baggage, as well as prepare flight manifests.  Please answer the following questions in regard to this potential change:  a) What show times would be required for ANC flights?; b) What are gate availability and TSA processing requirements for flying from ANC?; c) How will the carriers notify passengers of flight cancellations (weather etc.)?; d) How would flying from ANC impact the per-mile price of the missions, as opposed to flying from Elmendorf AFB?
This agency has not made a final commitment to procure the stated requirement and this RFI should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of such procurement.  This agency is interested in obtaining responses to this RFI from prospective contractors but no contractor shall be reimbursed for providing this information, therefore, the Air Force will accept the requested information in whatever format is provided.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 481211.  The SBA size standard for this NAICS is 1500 employees.  All information provided by the contractor will become the property of the Air Force and will not be returned.  Responses are requested by 8 November 2006 and should include a point of contact, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address.  The anticipated period of performance is 1 Oct 07 through 30 Sep 08 with four 12-month option periods.  Interested parties capable of performing this requirement should send an e-mail with responses to the above questions to:  cliff.beasley@scott.af.mil, or forward your response to HQ AMC/A3KRS, ATTN:  Cliff Beasley, 402 Scott Drive Unit 3A1, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5302.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS) desires to replace the paper tape punch mechanism in the Fischer and Porter/Belfort (F&P) rain gauges with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) instrumentation. The instrumentation will read, translate, store, and send the precipitation accumulation data electronically; display the current readings; provide a self contained power system; provide a removable storage device for manual pickup and delivery of data; and support future additions of typical meteorological sensors and telemetry.  The NWS intends to upgrade approximately 2000 F&P gauges over the next 10 years or less, starting in 2007.  The NWS is interested in instrumentation in current manufacture, for sale to the general public, which can be used without hardware modification except for mounting and weatherizing.  The instrumentation will be contained within the rain gauge enclosure, which is weather resistant but not sealed against environmental influence.  Only parts of the power system (solar panels, and batteries with case) may be outside the gauge.  Modification of the F&P gauge or its enclosure, except for removal of unnecessary parts, will not be allowed. The configuration and operation of the instrumentation must be modular in construction and utilize high level user programming for control.  A laptop Personal Computer (PC) or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) may be used as the programming or maintenance interface, but not as the operator?s current-reading display.
	  The new instrumentation must provide the gauge performance and future expansion capability as per the NWS specification which will be posted in FedBizOpps on or about October 19, 2006. 
	The Government is seeking to identify the following through this Request for Information (RFI):
?	What COTS instrumentation is available to meet this application?  Please provide commercial part numbers.
?	Does the COTS instrumentation meet the environmental conditions and specifications?  Please identify the extent to which environmental conditioning or protection would be need to meet the conditions and specifications.
?	Please identify the instrumentation connectivity (power, input signals, output signals and formats) needed to provide the application. 
Interested parties having COTS instrumentation meeting these needs are encouraged to provide answers to the above questions in writing and a description of the proposed components in the form of brochures, catalog pages and/or written narrative.  Written narrative should not be more than twenty-five (25) pages in length, however, unlimited brochures and catalog pages may be supplied. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any material submitted in response to this RFI. Further, the Government makes no guarantee that this RFI will result in a procurement.
	A gauge is available for inspection at NWS headquarters, in Silver Spring Maryland.  Please contact David A. Desrosiers (telephone 301/713-1845 x115) for an appointment.  Submit comments and descriptive packages no later than November 30, 2006 to the attention of David A. Desrosiers at U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, NWS (Code W/OPS11), 1325 East West Highway, Station #3160, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.

The proposed system transmit and receive circuits must be interoperable with currently fielded system RF transmit and receive circuits.  The transmit circuits will interface with the existing shipboard transmit antennas and the manufacturer will supply the receive circuit antennas.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes â€“ it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This Request For Information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partyâ€™s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

Source."The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-08.  

A. Scope of Contract:  The purpose of this Request for Proposal is to acquire hardware, software and services as requested by the customer for Solicitation Number 4THO17067047.

The contractor shall perform the following tasks:

Acquire the computer hardware, software, installation and support as indicated on the previous page of this addendum to the SF 1449

1.0	INTRODUCTION

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) maintains the National Defense Ready Reserve Fleet as a source of vessels that can be activated to meet the shipping requirements of United States during national emergencies. Dedicated to strengthening the U.S. maritime transportation system to meet the economic and security needs, MARAD programs promote the development and maintenance of an adequate, well-balanced United States merchant marine, sufficient to carry the domestic waterborne commerce and a substantial portion of waterborne foreign commerce, and capable of service as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency. MARAD also seeks to ensure that the United States maintains adequate shipbuilding and repair services, efficient ports, effective inter-modal water and land transportation systems, and reserve shipping capacity for use in time of national emergency.

The Ready Reserve Force (RRF) is comprised of ships that are kept in a heightened state of readiness and can be activated within 4, 5, 10, 20, or 30 days to meet surge military sealift requirements in the event of war or military deployment. The machinery on-board these vessels must be maintained in complete readiness, although it is not operated on a daily basis. In support of this requirement, MARAD has implemented a sophisticated Machinery Oil Analysis Program (MOAP) that is managed by the Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) Technical Support Center (TSC). The MOAP has been in place for several years, and there is a requirement to review the accumulated condition data and machinery maintenance data for the purposes of making recommendations for updates.
      
This document presents a Statement Of Work (SOW) to perform a limits assessment for the MARAD Machinery Oil Analysis Program.

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

In support of the MARAD MOAP Limits Assessment the contractor shall work with the staff of the JOAP Technical Support Center and the staff of the Maritime Administration (MARAD). The contractor shall perform the following work items in support of the Limits Assessment:
 
a)	review historical oil analysis program data;
b)	perform statistical analysis;
c)	examine machinery failure data for correlation with condition data in AFCMS; 
d)	establish recommended limits;
e)	review recommendations with MARAD/JOAP; and,
f)	implement changes to existing MOAP.

Based on the results of these tasks, a MARAD Machinery Oil Analysis Program Limits Assessment document summarizing the associated results and recommendations shall be prepared.

The following sections provide additional detail describing the work required.

<SUBJECT>C -- Modernization of the George C. Young Federal Bldg and Courthouse
<DESC>Modernization of the George C. Young Federal Building and Courthouse, Design Phase
Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session.

On Thursday, October 26, 2006, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the design phase for Modernization of the George C. Young Federal Building and Courthouse.  The Networking Session will be conducted from 1 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in George C. Young Federal Building located at 80 N. Hughey Ave., 5th Floor Room 596, Orlando, Florida. 

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by The U.S. Bankrupty Court, and other Tenant Agencies.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is between $20,000,000 and $24,000,000 and most design and construction disciplines are expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have been Short-Listed as the prospective Architect/Engineer for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the Short-Listed Architect/Engineer firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified Subcontractors/Consultants.  Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service  		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor) (a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.  	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm. 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.  	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.  	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement Offers are due by close of business on 20 October, 2006.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal  (RFP) No. HHM402-07-R-0002.  This is a unrestricted RFP.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541519.  Period of Performance: 1 work year. The contractor shall perform all services and provide all necessary equipment to accomplish the requirement(s) as stated in the statement of work, entitled, "DoDIIS Distributed Laboratories and DIA Infrastructure Support, dated 11 October 06 and the Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254. The contractor must supply the brand name equipment listed or an equal that will satisfy the government's requirement.  If supplying an or equal the contractor shall specify brand name and model number of each piece of or equal equipment. The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed priced contract.  Statement of work: 1. Purpose The DODIIS IT requirements are ever expanding and the R2 mission has never been more important.  A vital element of this is the RRC-2 D2Lab effort.   The D2Lab has grown from supporting projects and developers limited to the Washington Capital Beltway to supporting all of DODIIS through its enterprise approach of connecting remote DODIIS labs, resources, and people into one virtual lab.  The D2Lab will be required to support multiple environments which will allow all aspects of prototyping, testing, integration, and development of all DODIIS programs.  The environments are LabX, development, system integration and test (SI&T), and the production test environment (PT&E).  LabX will play a significant role in allowing functional user feedback to projects undergoing prototyping or providing feedback on new vendor products.  This feedback is crucial and allows the customer to get an early peek and try out potential forthcoming systems. To successfully meet this vision, the fundamental pieces have to be in place.  The recently upgraded JWICS lab in Merrifield, VA is the main hub for D2Lab SCI activities.   Merrifield also contains an unclassified and SIPRNET lab.   Each one of these labs must support the multiple environments identified above.  Though Merrifield is the D2Lab hub, remote labs throughout DODIIS must be connected via existing DODIIS networks back to Merrifield in a secure matter to complete the vision of a truly distributed virtual D2Lab. Most of the equipment and service items listed above are required to upgrade the ailing unclass and SIPRNET labs.  Most of the network gear is near end of life.  Electrical services are required in all Merrifield labs to meet the rapidly growing influx of development projects.  Other items are required to support management of a complex VLAN structured network, with firewalls and VPN connectivity to users and sites. At Merrifield, in one or more network enclaves, D2Lab is supporting the following DODIIS enterprise development projects: Global Enterprise Services (GES), IPE, EPortal, ProSight, Seibel, OPSWARE, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), DoDIIS Identity and Authorization Service (DIAS), the JITF-CT?s DUKE program, GEMINI, All Source Intelligence Environment (ALIEN), Endeca, DHMO-Endeca, METS, DataBroker, PS3, and a myriad of prototyping efforts in LabX.  It is mission critical that all these programs are supported and that D2Lab has the means to do so.  For example, DIAS will be the security linchpin system that all DODIIS applications must interface with to identify what user credentials and clearances they have and what they are able to see and do.  Another is a business application, ProSight, where all DODIIS financial information, and portfolio management occurs for OMB 300 compliance.  The last example is GES.  This core bundle of services is the new backbone for DODIIS email, calendaring, login services, and shared folders.  This development must continue to ensure timely deliver of all these services. Finally, the unclassified segment of the D2Lab at Merrifield is currently supported by a T1 communications link.  This link is below the necessary bandwidth required to support the number of DIA and supporting contractors at the site.  There is significant delay in response time when using this network.  The unclassified segment will serve a significant new role in the DODIIS environment as it becomes available to all DODIIS users for potential prototypes, demos, and unclassified development.  This upgrade will triple the speed of the network.  The hardware cost will support the line upgrade.  Monthly charge as noted. 2.0 Objective The Objective of this effort is to provide necessary facility upgrades to the D2Lab IT infrastructure.  The D2Lab is divided into three security enclaves:  Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI), Secret, and Unclassified.  Additionally, the D2 Lab is divided into three functional environments: prototype/development, systems integration and test, and production test.   Each functional environment has entry and exit criteria with specified processes and procedures in accordance with R2 departmental policies.  The prototype/development environment provides IT infrastructure support for initiative leads working with vendors to refine applications and develop application programming interfaces (APIs) for the purpose of satisfying standing and derived requirements.  The systems integration and test environment provides an IT infrastructure for DODIIS initiative leads and their support contractors to integrate applications into the DODIIS baseline, as well as apply and test security settings.  The third environment supports production testing by the Independent Test Authority (ITA).   The ITA will be responsible for ensuring that all applications developed for the Regional Service Centers (RSC) are thoroughly tested in D2Lab. 3.0 Scope This effort shall provide for the planning, procurement, engineering, integration, test, installation, and support of the current DoDIIS Distributed Lab (D2 Lab), as well as any future modifications.  4.0 Procurement/Task This task procures the necessary HW/SW to implement item 1 of this SOW. The Contractor shall procure all of the hardware and software necessary for supporting the current and future development requirements of the D2 Lab.  All procurement is subject to prior Government approval. The Contractor shall perform all of the activities necessary to integrate the procured hardware and software. The Contractor shall perform all of the activities necessary to deploy the integrated hardware and software and ensure that all described environments are supported. The Contractor shall manage all network operations in the environments identified. 5.0 Period/Place of Performance The primary places of performance shall be the Merrifield facility (8613 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA) and the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center (Bolling AFB).  The period of performance shall be 1 year from the date of the award. 6.0  SECURITY CLEARANCE All contractor personnel will be properly cleared to the TS/SCI level (see attached DD254). The contractor shall possess an active TS facility security clearance. 
	CRITERIA FOR AWARD 1. Basis for Award.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Offeror should show that the objectives stated in the solicitation are understood and offer a logical approach to their achievement.  The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated below.  The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offerors received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror?s best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. (a)  The Government will perform a trade-off analysis of non-price factors against price to determine the best value to the Government.  Offers that are unrealistically low in total price will be considered indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexity and risk in meeting contract requirements and will not be considered for award.
(b)  Relative weight.  Non-price factors ( Security, technical approach and past performance) when combined, are more important than price. Of the non-price factors, security and technical approach are equally important, past performance being less important than either, security or technical approach.  The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase as the relative differences in non-price factors of offerors decreases. (c)  Evaluation Factors.  In selecting the best overall value, the following factors will be evaluated: Security, Technical Approach, Past Performance, Cost. Offeror's RFP response will be evaluated utilizing the factors below.  Offerors should consider these factors when preparing proposals.  The rating for each evaluation factor will be based on the Government?s determination of the degree to which the RFQ satisfies the requirements of each factor.  The highest possible rating is Excellent, with the lowest possible rating being Unacceptable.  2.  Security is a measure of whether the offeror's personnel have the requisite clearances prior to contract award.  The contractor must meet the security requirements as listed in the SOW and the DD 254.  This is a PASS or FAIL action.  3. The technical approach will consider how the contractor proposes to approach the SOW.  The contractor's technical approach shall be evaluated against the requirements of paragraph 4.0 of the SOW.  4.  Past Performances.  The Past Performance factor will be used to determine the risk of non-performance, defective performance, and/or late performance by evaluating each offeror?s reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type of services being solicited.  In evaluating past performance, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided by the offeror and may contact other sources of information.  Only relevant experience will be considered for past performance purposes.  An offeror with no record of relevant past performance will be given a "neutral" rating for past performance.  To assess reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type of product and services being solicited, the offerors shall submit at least three (3) sources, and include a POC name, phone number, contract number (if appropriate) and brief description of position. 5.  Cost/Price. This factor will evaluate the cost quote to determine price analysis, price reasonableness, and price realism of the proposed total evaluated price. The base period and option years (if applicable) will be totaled to determine the overall estimated price to be evaluated.  All responsible offers that conform to the solicitation requirements will be ranked according to price. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced between initial and each option year (if applicable).  Prices are unbalanced if they are significantly overstated or understated in relation to the actual cost of the work.   This may be ground for eliminating a quote from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic quote.  By signing its offer, the offeror certifies that each price stated on each CLIN includes an appropriate apportionment of all costs, direct and indirect, overhead, and profit. Each quote will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed price to be reasonable.  The government will evaluate price reasonableness in relation to commercial or market price lists, IGE, or any other information used as a basis or comparison. Each quote will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed price to be realistic and if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  An unrealistically low price, submitted either initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a quote from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an improvident quote.  RATING DEFINITION Excellent - The Contractor's proposal provides evidence that the Government can expect superior performance of the tasks and deliverables listed in the Statement of Work (SOW), with minimal risk of substandard performance.  An excellent rating indicates that the proposal contains significant strengths and few or no weaknesses.
Good - The Contractor's proposal provides evidence that the Government can expect performance of the tasks and deliverables listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) to meet standards, with moderate risk of substandard performance.  A good rating indicates that the proposal contains a number of strengths, but also some weaknesses.  Marginal - The Contractor's proposal provides evidence that the Government can expect minimal performance of the tasks and deliverables listed in the Statement of Work, with excessive risk of substandard performance.  A marginal rating indicates that the proposal contains strengths, but also significant weaknesses. Unacceptable - The Contractor's proposal provides evidence that the Government can expect substandard performance of the tasks and deliverables listed in the Statement of Work (SOW), with extreme risk of substandard performance.  An unacceptable rating indicates that the proposal may present some strength, but it also contains significant and important weaknesses.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Factors a) through d) are arranged in order of importance.  Technical Capability is of primary importance and includes two parts: 1) ability to provide the required conforming product or acceptable equal product and 2) the recycle/disposal process for spent blast media.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (GG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The ROC depends on Telelogic DOORS? for testing support as well, because it provides a means to tie test steps to specific requirements which is vital to successful verification of system performance. Without Telelogic DOORS?, the ROC would be unable to effectively manage and control critical baseline documentation used to support the NEXRAD computer systems. In addition, the ROC would lose the significant Telelogic DOORS? investment the ROC, National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL) and the RS Information Systems (RSIS) ORDA team have already made in this application. Telelogic North America, formerly QSS Inc., is the manufacturer of the software and the only vendor who provides the maintenance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-13.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 511210 with a small business size standard of $21.0 million. This procurement is not a small business set-aside.  

The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Agile Software Corporation for Agile/Oracle software maintenance and technical support for its proprietary configuration management software for the National Weather Service (NWS), Radar Operations Center (ROC), in Norman, Oklahoma. Background: The NEXRAD weather radar network is a Tri-agency (DOD, DOC, and DOT) funded and managed program. The use of the Agile software has enabled the members of the Configuration Change Board (CCB) to efficiently manage and track all technical information pertaining to the NEXRAD weather radar system configuration.  In September of 1993, the Prime Contractor (Unisys) for the NEXRAD weather radar (then referred to as WSR-88D) delivered a database for Baseline Status Accounting.  The product delivered was a front end application entitled ?CMStat? that ran on an Ingress database engine. CMStat used a command line interface that was extremely difficult to use and poorly designed. Over time, the poorly designed CMStat application began to function extremely slow and failed to meet additional criteria being demanded by the Tri-Agency. In 1997 the ROC solicited bids for software to replace CMStat and Agile Software was awarded the contract. In addition to the procurement of the Agile software, in January of 1998 the Agile Software Corporation was contracted to assist the ROC Configuration Management personnel to map the existing data from the CMStat database to the Agile database. This effort required hundreds of man-hours to complete and test. An additional three months of dedicated staff hours were necessary to attach graphic files to the document object in the database and modify configuration management processes to the current status. The ROC uses Agile software to manage technical drawings, technical manuals, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Configuration Change Requests (CCR), Document Change Request (DCR), Artwork Change Order (ACO), CCB member comments, and electronic approval for modifications to the NEXRAD radar system. All of the above listed documentation is contained within the application and may be viewed by any individual having access to the Agile server. The Agile client software gives the end user the ability to view any documents stored in the application even if the software that generated the document does not reside on the local PC. The Agile software is an integral part of the ROC engineering process tracking and the primary tool used to manage the configuration of the NEXRAD weather radar system. Requirements:  The ROC requires the delivery of all Agile server and client software upgrades and software patches that become available from the Agile Software Corporation. The ROC requires that all delivered Agile software be compatible with the existing Agile/Oracle database schema and must maintain the current software functionality. The ROC requires that all necessary Oracle server and client components and licensing be delivered with any Agile Software releases. The ROC requires unlimited telephone technical support for Agile server and client software and Oracle server and client software (as it relates to Agile software) be made available, at a minimum, during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

OFDA is mandated to respond rapidly to emergencies, providing assistance to those populations that have been uprooted from their homes, known as internally displaced persons.  There are an estimated 25 million people displaced throughout the world.   Internally displaced persons often are among the neediest and most vulnerable populations in a disaster situation.  They are separated from their houses and property, their lands, and sometimes their families, torn from their livelihoods.

OBJECTIVE

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be assigned to the TAG and will work closely with the staff of the Office of the Director.  The incumbent will be a senior advisor to OFDA on policy and program issues regarding protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations. 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The position involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of USAID policy and programs within a broad and complex geographic and functional specialty area.  This requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradictory.  The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance to the decisions and actions of senior policy officials, and to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  As part of this effort, the advisor must be able to rapidly identify and anticipate problem issues, help formulate strategic and programming priorities, and write under tight deadlines to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues as well as keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments. The work requires extremely strong writing and verbal skills.  

Collaboration with other offices, bureaus and agencies within and outside of the USG is also critical to this position.  Contacts will be with the Department of State and USAID employees at all levels, personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in other agencies, congressional staff, experts, United Nations (UN) staff, representatives of other donor governments, consultants, researchers and educators, and officials of non-governmental organizations.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings in Washington, foreign capitals, and in the field.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will participate in open meetings and conferences where s/he may be called upon to explain and defend USAID activities/approaches with regard to internal displacement and protection. 

Specific duties and responsibilities are as follows:

* Serve as an authoritative source of information on and analysis of internal displacement and protection issues for OFDA.  Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations;


* Help coordinate development of clear and articulate policy on internally displaced persons and protection issues for OFDA and USAID in general.  Make decisions and provide guidance that significantly affect OFDA and Agency IDP and protection policies;

* Serve as a key member of and provide guidance and direction to the DCHA Protection Working Group;

* Prepare OFDA senior management and DCHA senior leadership, where necessary, to speak on IDP and Protection issues before UN bodies, NGOs, Congress and other parts of the USG;

* Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with UN agencies and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of protection and IDPs; 

* Coordinate and provide front line communication with the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) regarding the development of strategies addressing displaced populations;

* Respond to relevant congressional and public inquiries and speak to various visiting groups about protection and displaced persons;

* Improve awareness and expertise of OFDA staff on IDP and protection issues.  Assist OFDA with better integration of IDP needs and protection issues into normal humanitarian relief, transition, and developmental programs;

* Coordinate with the OFDA Technical Assistance Group's IDP/Protection Specialist and with the Humanitarian Coordination Specialist within the Office of the Director in the development of IDP and protection policies, strategies, and program standards;

* Based on analysis and research, clarify and define USAID's leadership role within the USG in relation to IDP issues, including providing country-specific recommendations on how to address IDP needs;

* Coordinate with the various DCHA offices, including the Office of Transitions Initiatives (OTI), Office of Food for Peace (FFP), Office of Democracy and Governance (DG), Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Office of Program, Policy, and Management (PPM) on IDP and Protection issues;  

* Work with counterparts in other donor organizations to exchange information, establish meetings, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities regarding IDPs; and coordinate these activities with relevant DCHA offices; 

* Articulate IDP and protection policies to personnel within OFDA, the DCHA Bureau, USAID Missions and other USAID Bureaus, and to other U.S. Government agencies, other donors, and implementing partners, through participation in conferences, speaking engagements, and field visits;

* Participate in OFDA grant review process as needed, including reviewing partner proposals and providing technical recommendations;

* Assist OFDA staff to translate policies and strategies into effective programming, as needed;

* Represent USAID on multi-donor missions to emergency situations in the field;

* Travel to the field as needed, sometimes on short notice, for possible durations of several weeks;

* Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis;
