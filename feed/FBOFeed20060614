<DESC>Preparedness for public health threats is a major goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An influenza pandemic has a great potential to cause large numbers of deaths and illnesses over a short time period. A pandemic occurs when there is an antigenic shift in influenza A virus resulting in a new human influenza strain to which most or all of the world's population is susceptible. Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century, the most severe of which, in 1918, caused over 500,000 U.S. deaths and more than 20 million deaths worldwide. Within the scientific community, it is generally believed that the occurrence of another influenza pandemic is highly likely. Recent outbreaks of human disease caused by avian H5, H9, and H7 influenza strains in Asia, Europe, and North America highlight the potential of new strains to be introduced into the population. Estimates for the next pandemic, extrapolating from those of the 20th century, range from about 100,000 to over 2 million deaths in the U.S. alone.  

Influenza vaccines are considered a primary means to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with the next pandemic.  HHS is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current influenza vaccine supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness.

The Department of Health and Human Services through the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Office of Research and Development Coordination contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to support retrofitting manufacturing facilities for production of pandemic influenza vaccines. The approach may include retrofitting of an existing pilot plant for vaccine seed preparation and/or commercial manufacturing facilities that are currently used to produce Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed biological product for egg-based or cell culture-based bulk production and/or fill finish manufacturing of pandemic influenza vaccines. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include conceptual and detailed retrofitting and mechanical engineering design, facility modification and commissioning, facility and manufacturing equipment, and validations of facility/process/systems as required for FDA licensure for manufacturing of influenza vaccines, and warm base operation. Facilities must meet USDA and CDC biosafety containment guidelines for Select Agent usage, WHO recommendations for production of influenza vaccines from reassortants derived from avian influenza viruses, and physical security measured as outlined for BioShield products. The objective of this project is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine supply for influenza pandemic preparedness.  

The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to two years.  Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-VB-06-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps website on or about June 29, 2006 with proposals being due on or about August 14, 2006.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this internet site for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government Wide Numbered Note 26.  All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-VB-06-07, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  This solicitation may result in multiple awards.  It is anticipated that an award will be made in 2006.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Photonic Systems, Inc., 900 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica MA, 01821 for the purchase of the following test equipment items: 1) One (1) Modulator Controller for power ratio control of bias of polymer 1550NM modulators; 2) Two (2) Modulator Controller for minimization of 3rd harmonic of test dither tone for control of bias of polymer 1550 NM modulators; 3) One (1) Modulator Controller for ditherless bias control of polymer 1550 NM modulators; and 4) Six (6) Modulator Controller Kit for control of bias of 1550NM optical modulators via RF dither signal. Test equipment is required by in-house research groups in the Photonics Center to control optical modulators used in experiments on new analog optical-microwave links for space-based radar applications.  Test equipment is custom controllers which utilizes a unique proprietary technique to control the general modulator bias set point by maintaining a constant input-to-output optical power ratio. Substitution of these modulator controllers is unacceptable due to the negative impact on the testing both in terms of cost and schedule.  Justification is based on PSI, Inc. is the sole developer of this instrument which is a standard ditherless quadrature controller to be used in AFRL Rome Research Site for in-house research. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received (quote with product specifications) will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Florida intends to solicit General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS), Inc., 1400 Key Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209-1518 on a sole-source basis for Phase Two of the development of the Protector System.  Phase One initiated in FY 05 as a part of NSWC PC’s support of Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration and the integration of the General Dynamics Protector System.  The Phase One contract was awarded through the Defense Microelectronics Activity.  While GDAIS provided multiple technologies for Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) during the Integrated Technology Demonstration (ITD-4), one has been identified as key for further development, integration and testing.  This technology, based upon GDAIS expertise in bio-aerosol sampling, detection and identification, is the focus of the Protector Phase Two effort as a follow-on development to Phase One.  Phase Two will continue to improve network and sen!  sor integration.  The main focus will be to further integrate the systems developed by GDAIS into the DTRA SensorNet testbed, thereby providing: 1) More capabilities integrated into DTRA’s SensorNet; 2) More proof of the SensorNet open architecture approach; 3) Further identification, development and refinement of the SensorNet insterface(s) required to support homeland security initiatives (i.e., BioWatch), and; Testing of innovative bio-detection technologies in support of force protection.  The General Dynamic’s PROTECTOR system is proprietary and does not currently support Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that would allow other vendors to interface to this system, but APIs are an objective of the tasking associated with this contract.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies. Size standard is 750 Employees.

The Space Fence will have a modern, net-centric architecture that is capable of detecting much smaller objects in low/medium Earth orbit (LEO/MEO). The system will operate with greater accuracy and timeliness to meet warfighter requirements for Space Situational Awareness. ESC is conducting a Concept Studies Phase, including a Risk Reduction contract effort, during the FY05 to FY07 time period. The follow-on system development, production, and fielding phases are expected to begin in FY08, with development contract award early that year. Delivery of the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is expected in the FY13-14 time frame.

This data should be provided by all channels of distribution (i.e., data for chain drugs stores, independent stores, mail order, and food stores.  The IMS National Prescription Audit data was determined to be the most comprehensive source of prescription drug information on the market.  No other data set could approach the reliability and consistency of those offered by IMS Health.  The large number of retail pharmacies that report to IMS (a 20,000 pharmacy sample), the innovative computer design used to collect the data, and the use of sophisticated sampling techniques employed makes their database a superior one.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Other Submission Requirements Applicants must submit applications electronically to kpuma@pica.army.mil on or  before the response date. V.	Application Review Information A.	Evaluation Criteria 1.	Technical merit Technical Merit ratings reflect the governmentâ€™s confidence in each offerorâ€™s ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to meet the stated objective. Excellent  â€“ Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of the objectives and approach and has a high probability of achieving all or most of the  requirements of the objective.  Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government. Good  â€“ Proposal demonstrates good understanding of the objectives and approach and has a good probability of achieving most of the requirements of the  objective.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will significantly benefit the government. Fair  â€“ Proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the objectives and approach and has a fair probability of achieving some of the requirements of the objective.  Proposes an acceptable solution with few or no strengths. Poor  â€“ Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of objectives and approach  that has little probability of achieving the objective.  Proposes a less than  minimally acceptable solution. This criterion assesses whether the approach is technically sound and/or innovative, if the methods are appropriate, and whether there are clear project  goals and objectives. 2.	Project costs The Cost Realism area will receive a narrative rating.  A cost benefit analysis of the offeror(s) Grant Proposal will be performed on the cost.  This analysis will consist of the following areas, which are all of equal value, (1.) Cost and (2.) Quality of Cost Share. This criterion evaluates the budget to determine if it is realistic and commensurate with the project needs and time-frame. B. Review and Selection Process 1.	Technical Review Applications meeting the requirements of this solicitation will undergo a  technical review.  Technical review is conducted by a minimum of three  independent reviewers. Each reviewer will individually evaluate and score proposals using the evaluation criteria provided in Section V.A.2.  This review will generally involve individuals in the field of science, engineering, technology and/or mathematics from DoD organizations. The technical reviewersâ€™ ratings will be used to produce a rank order of the proposals.  The Government intends to award one (1) grant on a best value basis. C.	Selection Factors The DOLC Director may review the ranking of the proposals and recommendations  of the technical review panel and make recommendations to the Selecting Official. The average rank order from the review panel will be the primary consideration for the Selection Official in deciding which of the new proposals  will be recommended for funding to the Grants Officer on a best value basis.  However, the Selecting Official will select proposals after considering the technical reviews and recommendations of the DOLC Director. VI.	Award Administration Information A.	Award Notices Successful applicants will receive notification that the application has been  recommended for funding to the DOLC Grants Office. This notification is not an  authorization to begin performance of the project. Official notification of funding, signed by a Grants Officer, is the authorizing document that allows the project to begin. Unsuccessful applicants will be notified that their proposal was not selected for recommendation.  B.	Administrative  The Department of Commerce Pre-Award Notification Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements contained in the Federal Register notice of December 30, 2004 (69 FR 78389) are applicable to this solicitation. Limitation of Liability In no event will DOLC or the Department of Commerce be responsible for proposal preparation costs if these programs fail to receive funding or are cancelled because of other agency priorities. Publication of this announcement does not oblige DOLC to award any specific project or to obligate any available funds. C.	Reporting Grant recipients will be required to submit financial and performance  (technical) reports. All financial reports and performance (technical) reports shall be submitted to the DOLC Grants Officer and to the DOLC Director.  Electronic submission of performance reports is preferred.

<SOLNBR>W52H09-06-R-0195
<RESPDATE>022106
<CONTACT>Michelle Sanner, (309)782-4931
<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Rock Island, Rock Island, IL 61299, on behalf of the Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM-SW), has a requirement for a non-developmental carbine that is capable of firing U.S. standard M855 and M856 ammunition.  The acquisition  will be a capabilities based competition to a performance requirement, not a detailed design technical data package. The Carbine shall demonstrate a minimum of 3,800 Mean Rounds Between Essential Function Failure (MRBEFF) for Class III malfunctions (i.e., for non-operator correctable malfunctions which cause the loss of essential functionality) and a minimum of 600 MRBEF F for Class I and II malfunctions combined (Class I malfunctions are operator clearable within 10 seconds, whereas Class II malfunctions require more than 10 seconds but less than 10 minutes to clear but can be corrected by the operator with available equi pment).  Mil-Std-1913 rails shall be incorporated on each weapon, and each weapon shall be compatible with currently fielded sighting, aiming and illuminating devices enabling the warfighter to rapidly and effectively engage stationary and moving targets both with reflexive fire at close ranges, and with precision fire out to the maximum effective range of 500m.  These devices include but are not limited to:  the M68 Close Combat Optic, the AN/PEQ-2A, the AN/PAQ-4B/C, the AN/PAS-13, the AN/PVS-14, and the AN/PVS-4. In addition each Carbine must be compatible with the M203 under-barrel 40mm Grenade Launcher.  A properly zeroed Carbine shall enable a warfighter firing from the prone position to engage E-type silhouettes and hit each target 15 out of 30 rounds from 300m. The Carbine shall have a sustained rate of fire greater than or equal to 45 rounds per minute without degrading reliability.   The weight of the Carbine shall be no more than 6.5 lbs, unloaded. The Carbine shall have a minimum barrel life of 10,000 rounds. All Proposals will include written submissions and test (bid) samples, both will be due 30 days after Solicitation release.  A pre-solicitation or a pre-proposal conference may be conducted at a later date (to be determined). The offeror shall submit seven (7) complete weapon systems, along with sufficient spare parts, to the Government for bid sample testing no later than the closing date of the solicitation. Should an offerors bid samples pass through the initial and subsequent screening criteria, the samples will be evaluated with live fire to demonstrate the weapons ability to meet the system requirements.  The winning offeror will be awarded a contract for test quantities with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Subsequent to the production of LRIP quantities, the Government may award multiple Full Rate Production (FRP) options  to the winning offeror (up to 200,000 total weapon systems if the total number of options are exercised).  Production in the United States/Canada will be required for the majority the FRP quantities. In addition to meeting the requirements above, characteristics that are being considered for evaluation include Reliability/Durability and Cost. Information contained in this pre-solicitation notice is subject to change prior to final Solicitation.  A Request for Proposal (RFP), W52H09-06-R-0195, will be posted on the TACOM-Rock Island Acquisition Center website located at: https://aais.ria.army.mi l is planned for release on or about 20 March 2006.  Proposals, along with seven (7) bid samples, are required to be delivered within thirty (30) days from the date the RFP is released.  Point of contact for this requirement is Teresa Stottlemyre, Contract  Specialist, AMSTA-LC-CSC, BLDG 110, Rock Island Arsenal, IL 61299, email: teresa.stottlemyre@us.army.mil, telephone number: (309)782-4626.

<CONTACT>charles malone, 256-876-9119
<DESC>The CH-47, Cargo Helicopter Self Defense Armament Subsystem (CH SDAS), employs the M240H machine gun which in turn utilizes the M24 gun mount. Description M24 Mount:  The CH47 SDAS is installed in the cabin window on the left side and in the right door of the aircraft using the M24 mount.  The outboard face of the pintles provides depression stops for the gun.  The M24 inboard surface is shaped t o function as a cam.  CAM Followers installed with the pintle combine with the cam to provide elevation stops. Current:  The M240H machine gun utilizes the legacy M24 mount, which has an ammo can that has a 200 round capacity mounted on the M240H machine gun along with a collection system.  The current ammunition can/collection system and M24 mount will not support  a 400 round ammunition capacity nor egressability/stowability requirement.  Crewmembers must remove and replace two ammo cans in a two minute period to meet the two minute 400 round requirement.    Requirement:  There is an operational requirement to meet a High Capacity Feed System (HCFS), which will allow the mount to support a 400 round capacity for two minutes at the weapons rapid rate of fire without failure of jamming/interruption. The feed sy stem must have the ability to be connected and disconnected from the M240 feed tray within 5 seconds.  The HCFS will not interfere with the operation of the lower or upper cabin door.  The HCFS shall be backward compatible with existing M24 mount installat ion, it shall be able to convert back to original configuration. The collection system must be able to collect the casings and links from two minutes of firing at the sustained rate of 400 rounds without overflowing or causing a stoppage.  The collection system cannot interfere with the operation of the gun.  Additional ly, the casing collection system cannot interfere with entering or exiting the aircraft by combat troops, nor can it interfere with the operation of the aircraft. Mount Requirements:  The mount/arm must have the ability to be egressable/stowable such that it can be disconnected and pivoted away, such as a bifold/break in half for easy egress/ingress, from the cabin door entrance with the M240H machine gun attached.  At the end of the pivot, the mount/arm must have a locking mechanism to secure it to the aircraft.  The M240H machine gun will also have a locking mechanism that causes the M240H machine gun to be stowed in the muzzle down position.  The mount/arm will no t interfere with operation of the cabin door while in a stowed position. The mount/arm, to include magazine/cradle shall weigh no more than 65 lbs.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supplies, parts, transportation, equipment, and facilities necessary to perform all work required for completion of Project Number FTQW 03-1048 in strict accordance with the Statement of Work and all contract requirements.  Work is described by the contract documents, drawings and technical specifications.  The work involves replacing the existing cooling pump pond pump house and three pumps at Eielson AFB, Alaska.  The general work includes replacing the existing cooling pond pump house, which provides cooling water to the Central Heat and Power Plant (CHPP) condensers.  The pump house will be onshore adjacent to the cooling pond with water drawn through an intake pipe.  The government will supply the pump motors and provide electrical power to the new pump house.  A new 30-inch water line will be constructed from the pump house to the CHPP to provide a redundant cooling water path for added security for plant operations.  The Government will construct the 30-inch pipeline from the CHPP to a point approximately 120 feet north of the power plant.  This project will provide the continuation of this pipeline to the new pump house.  The existing and new 30-inch pipelines and the well water pipelines will be connected and valved to allow cooling water to be provided from either the cooling pond or wells by way of either 30-inch pipeline.

<SUBJECT>26 -- TIRE PRIVATIZATION RFP FOR AIRCRAFT NOTICE IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE
<SOLNBR>FINALSP0700-06-R-7022

<DESC>THIS IS ISSUED TO CORRECT THE TITLE TO READ: TIRE PRIVATIZATION RFP FOR VEHICLES NOTICE IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE.


THIS IS A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a RFP for the Tire Privatization Initiative on Friday, June 30, 2006.

The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals for supply chain management of vehicle (Land) tires for the Department of Defense. Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all vehicle tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function. The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these tires.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  

The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis and is being solicited as unrestricted. This acquisition will use a Long-Term Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract, five year base period with one-five year option period, with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) provisions. The EPA provision is limited to a maximum increase of 7% per year. IAW FAR 2.101 the contracting officer has determined the tires to be purchased under this solicitation meet the definition of commercial items and will be solicited under FAR Part 12. This solicitation includes an Add/Delete clause which allows the Government to adapt the resultant contract to the changing needs of the military customer.   

The solicitation will be available at the following web site:
http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/tiremgmt   

Schedule: This solicitation will issued on 30 June 06. The Solicitation closing date will be 18 August 06.

WE DO NOT POST OUR SOLICITATIONS ON THE FEDBIZOPPS, ONLY THE NOTICES. THE SOLICITATION WILL ONLY BE POSTED AT THE WEBSITE LISTED IN THIS NOTICE.

<RESPDATE>061906
<ARCHDATE>06142007
<CONTACT>Stephanie D. Hunter, Contracting Officer, Phone (281) 483-8523, Fax (281) 483-4173, Email stephanie.d.hunter@nasa.gov
<DESC>This is modification 2 to the synopsis entitled Ground-Based Studies in Radiation Biology, NNJ06ZSA001 which was posted on February 22, 2006. The submission deadline for step-2 proposals remains June 19, 2006. The purpose of this notice is to post questions and responses for offerors invited to submit step-2 proposals: Q1:For experiments involving animals at Loma Linda and Brookhaven National Lab, should we plan to submit our protocols to their IACUC review boards in addition to ours at our home institution?  Do I need to submit animal study protocol paperwork to you from Loma Linda or Brookhaven? If so, who do we contact for their forms and information? R1:	The PI's institutions IACUC approval needs to be part of the Step-II proposal, but not LLU or BNL.  Only the IACUC approval or evidence that the protocol is under review from the PI's institution is needed for the Step-2 review. If NASA receives a proposal involving animals without IACUC certification, or without a letter indicating the protocols have been submitted for review by the PIs institutional review board, then the proposal is non-compliant per the NRA. The protocols do not need to have been submitted to BNL or LLU at the time of Step-2 submission.  However, the PIs are highly encouraged to submit their protocols early, or at the very least familiarize themselves with the BNL / LLU facilities and policies Q2:How much attention should I give the beam in my experimental design section? From the NRA it seems as though we submit our ideas and then worry about the beam stuff after we've been selected. Is this correct? R2:The scheduling/time will be taken care of if you are selected for award. What you want to use to irradiate should be clear in your proposal. Q3:If I have a collaborator I want to include in my budget but do not want to include as a PI, will I need a biosketch and all the other information needed for PI's? R3:You will need to include a biosketch for anyone listed on the budget. Q4:Should the housing of animals used in the studies be incorporated into the budget as direct costs or as subcontracts with Loma Linda and/or Brookhaven? R4:NASA cannot advise on this matter.  This decision will need to be made by the proposer in conjunction with his/her home institution. Q5:What forms do we need for subcontracts for the NASA Ground-Based Studies in Radiation Biology? R5:The form used to report subcontracts over $500K is SF294 (see p. 2 of SF294 for further reporting instructions). However, please note that the use of this form as regards the Ground-Based Studies in Radiation Biology would only be applicable to award recipients; this form is not required for Step-2 proposals. Q6:What is included in the 20-page page limit? Is it everything in the proposal document, or is it just the scientific description with references? Can the references be a separate document? R6:The 20-page limit applies only to the scientific description (page 20, Project Description, bolded text). The references can be a separate document. Q7:Should my proposal be funded we are going to desperately need some new lab equipment just to keep up with the workload.  What do I need to do in order to include this in my proposed budget? R7:If the equipment purchase is necessary in order to do the proposed research, you should include it as part of your budget (page 37, Facilities and Equipment) Q8:What does the term “Business Data” mean? R8:Business Data is a term used by the NSPIRES system to cover various pieces of information, such as Start and End dates, submission of the proposal to other agencies, environmental impacts of the proposed work, etc.  Q9:What kind of “Budget” should I describe here? How is this “Budget” different from the “Budget justification” (Line 8 of the same page)? Can I have a sample of this? R9:The Budget form in NSPIRES is going to ask for the line item entries for each budget item, such as salaries and equipment expenses, without allowing the PI to provide significant detail. The budget form is a component of the NSPIRES system, and the PI will see that form when completing it online. The budget justification should be a written description justifying any budget items not sufficiently self-explanatory. For example, if a large piece of equipment is included in the budget, explanation as to why that equipment is needed for the proposed work should be given as justification for the cost. Another example may be justification of cost for the care of a large number of animal subjects. This form is created by the PI and can take any format the PI wishes. Q10:Where is the standard title page? What are the required elements for the title page?  How does a step-1 cover page differ from a step-2 cover page? R10:There is no standard title page form; it is created by the proposer. The PI can include any information they wish on the Title Page. There are no required elements.  The cover page is a form generated by the NSPIRES system when the PI completes the Proposal Summary, Budget, Business Data and Proposal Team information. There is no single form. The Cover Page is the collective term used for the Proposal Summary, Budget, Business Data and Proposal Team. Not all of these elements were mandatory for Step-1 submission, but are mandatory for Step-2 submission. Any of these elements that were filled out for the Step-1 submission will automatically be available when the PI begins the Step-2 submission. Q11:Can the title for step 2 proposal be different from that for the step 1 proposal? R11:The title can be changed from the Step-1 submission. However, the area of emphasis of the proposed work cannot change from the Step-1 proposal unless the PI was directed so by the program office.  Q12:Is there a specific anticipated start date for the project if awarded? R12:The NRA states that it is estimated that the initial selection will be announced by September 2006 and the grant/cooperative agreement will be awarded in a reasonable timeframe thereafter. Q13:Are there any specific form pages?	Budget pages in particular.  R13:Aside from the require fields filled out for the NSPIRES on-line submission, there are no specific form requirements.  Any information uploaded as part of the proposal document must follow the instructions in the NRA, but can be in any layout the PI wishes. Q14:If subcontracts are involved should a separate budget and justification for them be included in the application or just included in our budget pages? R14:For Subcontracts/Subawards: (From NRA proposers guidebook Section 2.3.11).  Attachments (the budget justification) should describe the work to be subcontracted/subawarded, estimated amount, and recipient (if known). Itemized budgets and justifications are required for all subcontracts/subawards. Q15:Are there any additional forms to be completed for this solicitation or are all of the forms needed contained in the application package that was downloaded via grants.gov? R15:All the required forms are contained in the grants.gov application package. Q16:I’m completing the Step 2 process in response to this NASA NRA, and have a question as to whether some type of “biosketch” or CV is needed for each investigator. The Announcement leaves it out of the list of 9 items for the Proposal Document, but I’m not sure, then, how reviewers will be able to look at the qualifications of the investigators. Do they need to be submitted somewhere? R16:The biosketches are part of the NSPIRES Cover Page (Same is true for the budget).  When you fill out the information for the “Cover Page”, you will fill out information on the proposal team.  Part of that information is the Biographical Sketch.  We will receive it when your proposal is submitted.  It is not part of the uploaded proposal document.  Please note you can only load your own biographical sketch.  Other team members will have to load their own biographical sketches into the system.  Please contact the NSPIRES help desk if you require assistance in adding your biographical sketch to the cover page. Q17:I have a question about a person who will be listed on the grant submission for salary, but is someone I would not consider to be a “co-investigator”. He’s being listed since we will need to pay him for doing some specific neurochemical analyses related to the project, but he’s not involved in the design or planning of the project itself. My thought was to not have him register with the NSPIRES system, but please let me know if you think he should. R17:That person sounds like a consultant.  The definition of a consultant in the NRA proposer guidebook is as follows:  Consultant – A Consultant is an individual who is critical to the completion of the proposed effort and is to be paid a fee for his/her services, which may include travel in order to consult with the PI, but who is not considered a sustaining “partner” in the proposed activities as is a Co-I (Note: the requirements for the proposal budget include the identification, justification, and costs of all Consultants).  Consultants should register with NSPIRES and accept their role on the team, but we do not require a biographical sketch for consultants.  Q18:Since neither of the grants that we are submitting are large and involve other organizations (except for beam time at Loma Linda), is it necessary to complete the Management Approach? R18:Completion of the management approach is required so we can understand how the work is being allocated between the PI and the Co-Is. Q19:Under the upload section, there is a "total budget" section.  Is this different than the budget on the cover page elements or can I ignore it? R19:You can ignore the total budget section.  It is not required for this NRA. Q20:You state that Co-I's and collaborator commitments are automatically sent to you.  Does this happen when they register?  So no signed letters of commitment are required from anyone (#9 on the list of proposal documents on page 18 of the Research Announcement). R20:The commitment statements are automatically sent to us when the Co-Is or Collaborators register and accept being part of the proposal.  The electronic response from them serves as the signed letter of commitment. Q21:I found where the biosketch and other support are for the PI along with a remove button.  If I remove what is currently there, will an upload button take its place to upload a current biosketch and other support?  When I add people will there be a button to upload their biosketch and other support (if needed)? R21:An upload button will allow you to re-upload your biographical sketch. Contact the NSPIRES help desk nspires-help@nasaprs.com or by telephone to(202) 479-9376 Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM Eastern Time if you have difficulty with this. Q22:Will you please clarify which positions should be listed on the cover page elements?  And who should have biosketches and other support pages uploaded? Between the grants, the personnel will be PI, Co-I, Postdoc, Consultant, Collaborators, Research Assistant.  Do I only include biosketches and other support for the PI and Co-PI? R22:You will need to include a biosketch for anyone listed on the budget. Q23:The Co-I asked me to find out if we should budget for beam time charges at Loma Linda or if this service is covered? R23:You do not need to budget for beam time at BNL or at Loma Linda in your proposal. Q24:For submission of step-2 proposals, does the IRB approval letter need to be signed by the IRB Board Chair or is the signature of the Director of Sponsored Projects sufficient? R24:Approval by the IRB Board is not needed for submission of step-2 proposals.  The signature of the Director of Sponsored Projects on the application for approval is sufficient. Q25:Since submitting the step 1 proposal the scope of my project has expanded to include carcinogenesis.   Am I allowed to change the title of my project? R25:The title of a project can be changed. Q26:Do I need to list each and every person/item that we are requesting indirect costs for, or can I list the entire category with the respective indirect costs for each? R26:Listing the entire category with the respective indirect costs for each is fine. Q27:I just want to confirm that postdocs are not listed in the team member elements section. R27:Everyone aside from the PI is listed as an "optional" team member. However, anyone who will be receiving money from an award should be listed under optional team members. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is	http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	 Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

The questions and answers from the pre-proposal conference held on 2006 JUN 09.  2.  List of Attendees.  Questions and Answers from pre-proposal meeting on June 9, 2006.  Q1.  What “conflict-of-interest” provisions or restrictions should industry or academia be concerned with?  What are the conflict of interest clauses?  A1.  It is not anticipated that a project proposed in response to this BAA would create an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  However, should a successful proposal involve the type of efforts addressed in that Subpart, NUWCDIVNPT would include an appropriate OCOI clause in accordance with the FAR.  Q2.  How much funding goes to this project?  A2. $150,000.00.  Q3.  How much overhead is expected to run the project?  A3. That is up to the offeror.  Q4.  Are partnerships encouraged?  A4.  Any approach that strengthens the COEUT concept is encouraged.  Q5. Can only a non-profit organization submit a proposal?  Are you looking for both large & small businesses?  How does private industry, such as Raytheon qualify to participate as an offeror?  A5. For profit organizations and members of industry can team with a non-profit, degree granting institution that submits a proposal.  Q6.  Will there be a mechanism for academia and industry to collaborate (i.e. means for posting interested organizations, docs, etc)?  A6. The list of people who attended the Friday, June 9, 2006 pre-proposal meeting will be posted on the website.  Q7. Will offerors be required to have written agreements with partners as part of their proposal?  A7.   A written agreement is not required at the time the concept paper is submitted.  However, a Letter of Intent or a written agreement is required to be submitted with the proposal.  Q8. 	Could the project be the generation of an idea/proposal?  A8. Offerors are free to propose whatever they want to.  However they should keep in mind that what they are proposing will be evaluated according to the evaluation factors in the BAA.  Q9. Please elaborate on the types & amounts of cost share that you anticipate?  A9.  That is up to each offeror.  Q10.  Based on today’s presentation is the program limited to a one year program at $150K? A10.  No.  Q11.  Will there be some level of funding for management and administration of the Center?  A11.	It is up to the offeror how the split is managed.  Q12. 	Is electronic submission allowed for the concept paper?  A12. Yes.  Q13.	The proposal under subject area 2 must be a cost shared effort – is there a specific level of match required from the offeror?  A13. No.  Q14.  Are appendices that might contain resumes, facilities summaries, project experience allowed outside of the 25 page limit?  A14.  Yes.  Q15.  Where will COEUT be located?  A15. That is up to the offeror.  Q16.  Does the government require the offeror to have a physical COEUT or will NUWC host the physical location?   A16.  NUWC will not host COEUT.  Physical plant is up to the offeror.  Q17. What is the nominal and maximum duration of the award?  A17.   1 year, reviewed each year, up to 5 years.  Q18.  Will this be an annual event, or will it be handled as a re-compete?  A18.  NUWCDIVNPT anticipates that it will be 5 years before it re-issues this BAA.  Q19.  How will the availability of future funding be determined?  A19.  NUWCDIVNPT’s intent would be to fund any agreement that were to result from this BAA continuously for 5 years.  However, NUWCDIVNPT’s commitment would be limited to FY 07.  Q20.  Who is the “we” you referred to with respect to approaching potential sponsors for funding?  A20.  NUWCDIVNPT  Q21.  Are the project and the COEUT supposed to be $150K total in FY 07 or can the project be multiple years with some start up money in the first year?  A21.  Proposals may be for projects that can be completed within one year of award or may be for multiple year projects.  However, projects that last beyond one year must be broken into annual phases such that each phase can be funded as an individual option with clearly defined milestones and deliverables.  Q22.	If an entity is not part of this BAA, is the party limited from working with NUWC? (other than missing the 150K).  A22.  Multiple vehicles exist that could conceivably address working with NUWCDIVNPT:  -    Contract, Cooperative Research And Development Agreement , Educational Partnership Agreement , Technology Investment Agreement, Cooperative Agreement, Other Transaction.  Q23.  What are we doing in the area of Distributed Sensors?   A23   (John Muench will supply short synopsis of this.)  To be provided at a later date.  Q23. Can academic institutions that are government (i.e. Air Force Institute of Technology) be part of the offerors team?  A23. Yes.

Request for Information

Purpose:

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. This RFI constitutes a request for additional information pursuant to the USCGs RFI # ACS5D001 posted on FEDBIZOPS on July 15, 2005. This posting should be reviewed for background information. The USCG is soliciting additional and more detailed information on the following requirement from the previously posted RFI: RECEIVE/TRANSMIT: NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VHF Data Link to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm. The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nautical miles of the baseline from which U.S. Territorial waters are measured. Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1. The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and Transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined. Monitoring and Management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided. 

Response:

The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding capabilities for technical solutions, components and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI.     The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.     Due to a variety of imitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to this RFI.     Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.     Companies are requested to submit responses to this RFI no later than 26 June, 2006. Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives and identify whether or not your company is a large or small business based on the Size Standard of $12, 500,000 for NAICS Code 517910. Responses to this RFI can be submitted via email to: Ms. Muriel Thomas at mothomas@comdt.uscg.mil or Ms. Kerri Williams at kbwilliams@comdt.uscg.mil.

DoS overseas telephone network includes more than 550 telephone systems currently in operation worldwide with the program office FPT located in Springfield, Virginia. FPT through its JANUS Program is in the process of standardizing overseas telephone equipment by maintaining the legacy Nortel Networks Meridian 1 Digital communications systems and installing the Nortel Communication Server product line.  The Meridian 1 and Communication Server is capable of meeting transmission requirements worldwide and providing a Transfer Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-enabled switch management system.  The current NMSS environment uses the Nortel Optivity Telephony Manager (OTM). This is accomplished through (TCP/IP)-based monitoring and maintenance of post Private Branch Exchange’s (PBX) using connections via the DoS OpenNet.  When the post PBX is configured for IP management utilizing the OTM application, FPT is able to provide remote terminal emulation, event logging, alarm monitoring, PBX maintenance and password management. These features generated by the PBX are transmitted to the monitoring DoS facility, State Annex 21 (SA-21).

The NMSS will support the management of the overseas telephone network through timely and accurate coordination of all interactions with the DoS Enterprise Network Management Operations Center (ENMOC) to ensure that Service Level Agreement (SLA) objectives are achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner 
Question:  What are the SLA objectives?

The overall objectives of the NMSS is to:  (1) perform a critical, centralized, customer-centric coordination function, (2) technical assistance, and (3) provide superior customer support services to DoS, external customers, stakeholders, and technical assistance, as required either at SA-21 or an off-site contractor facility that meets the DoS security requirements. Specific requirements for this RFI are described below.

DoS is seeking an integrated NMSS solution/capability that can be leveraged department wide and provide tangible value to all FPT customers.  Responses should include information on scalability, capabilities to operate in a distributed, decentralized, and multi-tied environments.

FPT is exploring better ways to implement a NMSS. The purpose of the NMSS will be to (1) perform a critical, centralized, customer-centric coordination function, (2) technical assistance, and (3) provide superior customer support services to overseas posts, external customers, stakeholders, and technical assistance, (4) provide the lowest overall total cost of ownership, (5) provide best in practice quality of service, (6) provide configuration management. 

In terms of functionality, DoS is seeking an integrated NMSS solution that will significantly improve DoS’s ability to manage all its assets throughout their lifecycle.  This should include the ability to track, monitor, and report on assets at overseas posts from initial installation through final disposal.  The NMSS should assist DoS in management of network resources to proactively manage the environment to ensure sustained operational capabilities.  The NMSS should combine existing data sources/functionality with new capabilities.  It should also provide a mechanism for consolidated reporting and analysis to enable an enterprise view of telecommunications assets, resources, and operational effectiveness.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder CO proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Intlvac, 247 Armstrong Ave., Georgetown, Ontario for upgrades to two existing Ion Beam Deposition/Ion Beam Etch (IBD/IBE) systems required to fix limitations in the existing systems.

The upgrades must insure that both systems operate in a similar manner and have similar maintenance requirements.  The required upgrades are:
1. Corrections and improvements to the Intlvac software including:
a.	Two step recipe capability to allow two recipe steps that can consist of any combination of etch and deposition parameters. Both etch and deposition gun parameters, substrate parameters, and target parameters must be able to be arbitrarily set for each of the two steps. The reactive gas channel must be able to be activated during both etch and deposition processes. The existing problem in which the guns are on etching while the system is in transition from step one to step 2 must be fixed.
b.	Software must be implemented to set and read out crystal monitor on the Intlvac system. Software must allow for download of material parameters such as density and Z ratio and for easy calibration of deposition rates.
c.	Upgrade software to allow target labels to correctly update
d.	Modify software to allow manual indexing of target angles to allow easy target change
e.	Provide a soft button that will set valves to appropriate positions for gas bottle changes and purges.
Provide a new set of collimated graphite grids for the 8 cm etch source in the Intlvac system, install new grids, and demonstrate etching with better uniformity and stability than the existing configuration.
2. Provide two additional sample pucks for the Intlvac system
3. Provide a 3 cm ion source and controller for the Magnetic Multilayer system that has compatible operation and maintenance as the Intlvac system.
4. Provide two additional flow controllers for Ar and Oxygen that are compatible with the existing ones installed on the Intlvac chamber.
5. Provide a backing pump for the Magnetic Multilayer system that has same specifications, compatible operation, and similar maintenance requirements as the on the Intlvac system.

Intlvact is the only company that can provide the required upgrade technology because the upgrades require access to proprietary Intlvac software and engineering drawings that are not available to other companies. To insure all components operate correctly on existing systems, the upgrade package  must be provided by Intlvac.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before June 29, 2006. Anticipated award date is June 30, 2006.

<DESC>NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service has a requirement for two long range side scan sonars, one towed and one hull mountable. Requirements include the provision of all labor, material and expertise to assemble and supply two Long Range Fishery Research Side Scan Sonar Systems (one towed and one hull mountable) to support NOAA National Marine Fisheries projects. The anticipated systems must adjust the backscatter observations based on the system’s own estimates of the two dimensional slope of sea floor where the backscattering occurs.  The anticipated system must be capable of providing a swath of quantifiable backscatter statistics, extending from 750 meters to port of the trackline and through Nadir to 750 m to starboard of the trackline.  The statistical estimates should include, at least, the mean, mode, GLCM and variance that are developed from independent backscatter cells (aka. footprints or pixels).  The block size for the statistical estimates should be selectable from 5m X 5m to 200m X 200m. 

The system tow body should include a measurement of sound speed, an optical transmissometer, a Doppler Velocity Log, a scientific quality 38 kHz vertical beam sounder and a high quality motion reference unit.  The system tow body is to be separately capable of stable operations when towed between depths of 20 and 400 m at tow speeds between 1 and 12 knots. The weight, size (envelope) and volume of the tow body will be critical parameters in the selection process.  The sonar frequency, source level and spatial resolution in both the cross and along track directions will be critical parameters in the selection process.

It is highly desirable that the system be operable on an existing government owned fiber optic tow cable and winch with slip ring.

The anticipated system must provide clear concise quality control displays to insure that none of the individual receive elements (transducer staves) in the sonar are being saturated. The anticipated system must provide recordings of the basic quadrature samples on all individual receive elements as well as higher level products including the geocoded backscatter values and the statistical summaries.

The basic work includes: delivery of two long range side scan sonar systems for fishery research (one towed and one hull mountable), data acquisition and statistical data processing capability, data visualization, system documentation and post-acquisition analysis tools.  All deliverables shall be provided with spare parts for modular replacement.

The work will also include laboratory testing and at-sea acceptance testing, operator training at a contractor provided Seattle venue, an at-sea test on a NOAA vessel, and technical support on a 21-day Eastern Bering Sea cruise.  

Questions concerning this acquisition shall be directed to Contracting Officer Paul Reed at Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov. All inquiries must be submitted in writing. Telephone inquiries will not be honored.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  This is not an RFP.  The Aeronautical Systems Center F-22 System Program Office (ASC/YFK) is conducting a market survey for a long-term Performance Based Logistics (PBL) sustainment contract for the F119-PW-100 engine.  ASC/YFK anticipates issuing a long term PBL contract for sustainment of the F119-PW-100 engine on or about 1 Jan 08.  The potential period of performance for the contract associated with this sources sought synopsis is Calendar Year (CY) 08-CY17.  This acquisition is a follow-on to the sole source sustainment effort currently being performed by United Technologies Corporation, Pratt & Whitney (P&W), under the F119 engine production contract FA8611-04-C-2852.  The engine sustainment program is presently known as Field Support & Training (FS&T).  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist for this requirement.

FS&T is a two-phased strategy designed to support the F119-PW-100 engine.  Phase I support (initial operational capability), currently in progress, is provided by P&W and progresses through Phase II (long-term support), which includes public-private partnering for heavy maintenance as a fundamental approach. The FS&T concept of operations for the F119-PW-100 engine builds on and is consistent with the overall F-22 weapon system support concept, and focuses on system user priorities of availability and cost accountability.

The FS&T program supports United States Air Force (USAF) operators of the F-22 aircraft and associated F119 engines. Full Intermediate level (back shop) and heavy maintenance (depot) are currently performed and managed by Pratt & Whitney.  Organizational and limited intermediate level maintenance of the F119 fleet are currently and will continue to be performed by USAF maintenance personnel.

The long-term PBL sustainment prime contractor must demonstrate an ability to perform as the single point manager for all F119 engine sustainment activities.  The F119 sustainment concept of operations addresses six elements of support products and services: fleet management, material management, support equipment, technical order data (TOD), maintenance management and customer technical services.  This effort also includes follow-on flight test, support of air vehicle modernization, and modification programs.  The support program elements are implemented with a shared responsibility between the sustainment prime contractor and the U.S. Air Force. 

The fleet management element includes providing the technical information and support service resources to enable maintenance and materials management.  Functions include: program management, which encompasses comprehensive contractor support planning, implementation and contract management; engine management, which includes overall fleet management, retrofit planning, life cycle management and workload scheduling; engine configuration control; engine life management; logistics support analysis and maintenance planning; training support; and customer services support, including site activation, operation of a technical support center and contractor base-level support for operational sites.

Functions include: inventory management of contractor furnished material, forecasting, procurement, storage, handling and transportation of engines and modules, distribution, on-base support of the F-22 Parts Store, identification of common part requirements and shipping of assets by government or contract methods as appropriate.

Support equipment responsibilities include: procurement and delivery of all peculiar support equipment (PSE); material management for all PSE; packaging, handling, storage and transportation responsibilities (PHS&T), management of all PSE and PHS&T equipment repairs and procurement; and configuration control of all PSE.

Technical Order Data (TOD) responsibilities include development, sustainment and support of TOD for F119 engines and support equipment.  The sustainment prime contractor will be responsible for four TOD products: block cycle updates, time compliance technical orders, interim integrated electronic technical manual changes, and limited and full-intermediate levels of maintenance and heavy maintenance center presentation files in prescribed formats.  Required functions that support this effort are: technical writing, graphic illustration, parts information and quality assurance/systems integration with the aircraft prime contractor. 

Maintenance management addresses a comprehensive range of products and services including both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the F119 engine.  The USAF intends to utilize a Two-Level Maintenance Concept.  The sustainment prime contractor will provide maintenance support services at the Organizational-level (O-level) as well as retained limited off equipment tasks as described by the F119-PW-100 Logistics Support Analysis Database.  The sustainment prime contractor will also provide maintenance services for supplemental full Intermediate-level (I-level) tasks, as defined in the database, as well as heavy maintenance tasks typically performed at an organic depot.  In addition, the sustainment prime contractor will be required to train and deploy depot field teams to support USAF bases.  Maintenance management also encompasses the management, maintenance and engineering responsibilities associated with the Compass Vector Lead-the-Fleet accelerated engine maturation program.

Customer technical services include engineering and logistics capabilities required for operation and maintenance of the F119-PW-100 engine in the field.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Aeronautical Systems Center F-22 System Program Office (ASC/YFK) is conducting a market survey for a long-term Performance Based Logistics (PBL) sustainment contract for the F-22 air vehicle.  ASC/YFK anticipates issuing a long term PBL contract for sustainment of the present/future F-22 fielded fleet on or about 1 Jan 08.  The potential period of performance for the contract associated with this sources sought synopsis is Calendar Year (CY) 08-CY17.  This acquisition is a follow-on to the sole source sustainment effort currently being performed by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LMA), under the F-22 production contract FA8611-05-C-2850.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist for this requirement.

Program Background

The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) Demonstration/Validation phase involved two competing aircraft teams, led by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (with General Dynamics and Boeing as team members) and Northrop (teamed with McDonnell-Douglas), and two competing engine contractors, General Electric (GE) and Pratt &Whitney (P&W).  On 23 Apr 91, the Secretary of the Air Force selected Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for the air vehicle and overall weapon system integration and P&W for the engine.  The ATF was re-designated as the F-22, and Milestone II approval was confirmed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), 1 Aug 91, authorizing F-22 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and long lead procurement for four Pre–Production Verification (PPV) air vehicles.  EMD contracts were awarded in Aug 91.  The air vehicle Preliminary Design Review (PDR) was completed on 30 Apr 93 and the Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted on 20-24 Feb 95.  Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) began 29 Aug 05 and completed on 23 Nov 05.  The Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) awarded the F-22 Joint Systems Interoperability Test Certification on 14 Dec 05, finding the F-22 met all its critical interoperability requirements and certifying it interoperable for joint use.  Initial Operating capability (IOC) for the F-22 was declared on 15 Dec 05.  IOC declaration verifies the aircraft as a fully capable, multi-mission platform ready for combat.

Full and open competition was used in the Demonstration/Validation (Dem/Val) phase of this program.  The program was down-selected to two teams for both the air vehicle and engine EMD competition.  As a result of the competition, Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems (LMAS), currently Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LMA) and Pratt & Whitney (P&W) Large Military Engines received EMD contract awards. LMA currently provides F-22 sustainment support within the production contract and Pratt & Whitney provides F-119 engine support under a separate contract.  The air vehicle sustainment program is presently known as Performance-based Agile Logistics Support (PALS).  The future sustainment effort will establish a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract arrangement with partnering of Air Logistics Centers for depot level repair.  The effort will continue field sustainment via Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) and public/private partnering for the entire F-22 fleet.

PALS is a two-phased support strategy for the F-22 air vehicle.  Phase I support (Initial Operational Capability) is provided by the prime air vehicle contractor and progresses through Phase II (follow-on support), which includes public-private partnering for depot maintenance as a fundamental approach. The PALS concept of operations for the F-22 air vehicle builds on, and is consistent with, the overall weapon system support concept, and focuses on system user priorities of availability, cost, and accountability.

The PALS program currently supports United States Air Force (USAF) operators of the F-22 aircraft.  Full intermediate level (back shop) and depot heavy maintenance are currently performed and managed by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics.  Organizational level maintenance of the F-22 fleet will continue to be performed by USAF maintenance personnel.

The F-22 long-term PBL sustainment prime contractor must demonstrate an ability to perform the following functions:  Product Support Integrator (PSI), fleet management, material management, support equipment management, technical order data management, maintenance management and customer technical services.  Each of these functions is described below.  

Under the PBL guidance and concept, there is usually a single focal point for responsibility and accountability.  For the F-22 sustainment program, that focal point is known as the Product Support Integrator (PSI).  As such, the PSI will be required to implement PBL guidance and have a total weapon system support focus for the entire F-22 fleet, regardless of location.  The PSI will be responsible for integration across vendors, subcontractors and the government.  Additional SPI functions include oversight of all program support, partnering agreements, aircraft maintenance, modification scheduling and supply chain management.  Pratt & Whitney will continue to provide engine sustainment support through a partnered arrangement with Oklahoma City Air Logistic Center (OC-ALC) under a separate contract.

The F-22 PSI sustainment concept of operations addresses the following elements of support products and services:  fleet management, material management, support equipment, technical order data (TOD), maintenance management and customer technical services.  This effort also includes follow-on flight test, support of air vehicle modernization, and modification programs.  The support program elements are implemented with a shared responsibility between the sustainment prime contractor and the USAF.

The fleet management program functions include providing the technical information and support service resources to enable maintenance and materials management.  Functions include:  program management, (which encompasses comprehensive contractor support planning and integration), implementation and contract management; overall fleet management, retrofit planning, life cycle management and workload scheduling; configuration control; air vehicle life management; logistics support analysis, maintenance planning; training support; customer services support (including site activation), operation of a technical support center and contractor base-level support for operational sites.

Material management addresses inventory and configuration control point functions for F-22 initial and replenishment peculiar spare parts and spare modules.  Functions include:  inventory management of government and contractor furnished material, forecasting, procurement, storage, handling and transportation (PHS&T) of parts and modules, distribution, on-base support of the F-22 Aircraft Parts Store, identification of common part requirements and shipping of assets by government or contract methods as appropriate.

Support equipment responsibilities include:  procurement and delivery of all peculiar support equipment (PSE); material management for all PSE; PHS&T responsibilities, management of all PSE and PHS&T equipment repairs and procurement; and configuration control of all support equipment.

Technical Order Data (TOD) responsibilities include development, sustainment and support of TOD for F-22 air vehicle and support equipment.  The PSI contractor will be responsible for four products:  block cycle updates, time compliance technical orders, interim integrated electronic technical manual changes, and limited and full-intermediate levels of maintenance and heavy maintenance center presentation files in contractor format.  Required functions that support this effort are:  technical writing, graphic illustration, parts information and quality assurance/systems integration with the aircraft prime contractor. 

Maintenance management addresses a comprehensive range of products and services including both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the F-22 air vehicle.  The USAF intends to provide maintenance for Organizational-level (O-level) (on-equipment) and Two Level with Retained tasks (off-equipment) maintenance tasks, as described by the F-22 Logistic Support Analysis database. The PSI contractor will provide maintenance services for supplemental full I-level tasks, as defined in the database, as well as heavy maintenance tasks typically performed at an organic depot.  Maintenance management also encompasses the management, maintenance and engineering responsibilities associated with the F-22 air vehicle.

A USCG Quality Assurance inspection at origin shall be required and shall be conducted by a USCG Quality Assurance Representative. 
It is the Government’s belief that only TANO/L-3 and/or its authorized facilities can (1) obtain the necessary specifications and genuine OEM parts to accomplish this replacement; and (2) can furnish the required items and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Therefore, it is the USCG’s intent to handle this procurement as a sole source with Tano/L-3 or its authorized facilities/distributors. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Tano/L-3 are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Tano/L-3.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the USCG ELC from obtaining competition  as they are available from only one source.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to replace the existing system are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities.  
However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to provide the replacement Main Propulsion Control System for the USCG 270 WMEC Class Cutters 
for the purpose of the USCG to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the system and technical representation ,  are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities by providing:
(1)	Complete and Current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e.  salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics) or
(2)	Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer.
This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate. The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses shall be submitted within 15 days of this announcement.  Responses must be concise and specific to the requirements mentioned above.  The submission of data for review shall not impede award of a contract.
The complete solicitation package shall also be available for download from FedBizOpps, at www.fbo.gov on or about 15 August 2006.  Be advised this date is“estimated” at best.  Interested sources are encouraged to review FedBizOps daily until the solicitation becomes available.   See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>26 -- TIRE PRIVATIZATION RFP FOR VEHICLES NOTICE IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE
<DESC>THIS IS A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a RFP for the Tire Privatization Initiative on Friday, June 30, 2006.

The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals for supply chain management of vehicle (Land) tires for the Department of Defense. Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all vehicle tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function. The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these tires.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  

The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis and is being solicited as unrestricted. This acquisition will use a Long-Term Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract, five year base period with one-five year option period, with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) provisions. The EPA provision is limited to a maximum increase of 7% per year. IAW FAR 2.101 the contracting officer has determined the tires to be purchased under this solicitation meet the definition of commercial items and will be solicited under FAR Part 12. This solicitation includes an Add/Delete clause which allows the Government to adapt the resultant contract to the changing needs of the military customer.   

The solicitation will be available at the following web site:
http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/tiremgmt   

Schedule: This solicitation will issued on 30 June 06. The Solicitation closing date will be 18 August 06.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Loran Transmitter
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)

INTRODUCTION
The U.S. Coast Guard is developing requirements for a LORAN-C Transmitter.  The purpose of the Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the U.S. Coast Guard in formulating functional requirements, and identify qualified vendors who are able to meet our requirements.  The U.S. Coast Guard is open to alternative ideas.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help the U.S. Coast Guard better define its requirements and obtain a solution that meet its needs.

BACKGROUND
LORAN-C was originally developed to provide radio navigation service for U.S. coastal waters and was later expanded to include complete coverage of the continental U.S. as well as most of Alaska.  Twenty-four LORAN-C stations work in partnership with Canadian and Russian stations to provide coverage in Canadian waters and in the Bering Sea.  LORAN-C provides better than 0.25 nautical mile absolute accuracy for suitably equipped users within the published user areas.

Advances in technology have allowed for greater automation and consolidation of LORAN-C operations. The existing system is being modernized to take advantage of such technology.  More information on system modernization may be found at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov.loran.modernization.htm.

THE OPERATION STATUS OF LORAN-C
LORAN-C provides Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services for both civil and military air, land and marine users. LORAN-C is approved as an en route supplemental flight navigation system for both, Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) and Visual Flight Rule (VFR) operations.  The LORAN-C system serves the 48 continental states, their coastal areas, and Alaska.  While the U.S. Government continues to evaluate the long-term need for the LORAN-C radio navigation system, it will continue to operate the LORAN-C system in the short-term.

PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The U.S. Government is exploring methods of replacing the AN/FPN-44 and AN/FPN-64/64A series LORAN-C transmitters presently in the inventory. Replacement transmitters shall fully integrate into the Coast Guard LORAN-C Transmitting Stations with the existing Timing and Frequency Equipment (TFE), the Remote Automated Integrated Loran (RAIL) monitor and control system and with the various types of Loran transmitting antennas and shall not employ vacuum tube technology.  In an effort to reduce Loran-C Navigation System Unusable Time (UT), it may be required to provide an easily transportable, self contained transmitter system to be used as a temporary Loran transmitter, and also a transportable Test Load Device that can be easily configured to closely simulate the electrical characteristics of any Loran transmitting antenna.

While this RFI focuses on a new operational LORAN-C Transmitter, the U.S. Coast Guard remains open to alternative ideas and considerations, as pertaining to the enhancement of the Loran-C signal availability, integrity, accuracy and continuity.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternative methodologies that may help the U.S. Coast Guard better understand the potential of using differing analog/digital/hybrid modulation schemes to assess whether solutions exist to enhance the capability of Loran-C, while not affecting the current users of the Loran-C system. 

DECRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED
All vendors with an appropriate product or capability to produce a product relating to the requirements, set forth in the Potential Requirements attached hereto are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information.  The Capability Statement should discuss the product’s capabilities in meeting the potential requirements, the product’s system requirements, the product’s integration specification (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the U.S. Coast Guard’s understanding of the information submitted.

Respondents should also complete and/or enhance the Potential Requirements which contains provisional requirements for the Loran Transmitter.  We recognize that not all requirements may be met by a single system.  Please indicate in your response which capabilities require custom developed solutions.  Recommendations for functional or operational requirements for the transmitter are warranted and will be welcomed.

DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must comply with the U.S. Coast Guard’s confidential treatment regulation a 17 C.F.R. 200.83. Responses to this RFI will not be returned.

HOW TO RESPOND
Please submit your response to this RFI via email to Ms. Jeannie Sansone at Jeannie.L.Sansone@uscg.mil,  phone 609 523 7258, by Monday, July 10th, 2006, 10:00 A.M. EST. 
Technical questions call 609 523 7239 Mr. Edward Braknis

	POTENTIAL REQUIREMENTS

1) Produce the on-air signal as specified in COMDTINST M16562.4A (1994) http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/loran/sigspec/Default.htm   

	2) Match to existing antennas (625 to 1350 feet with measured impedance, resistance and reactance), at the radiated power (400 to 840 kW), to produce this signal.

	3) Accommodate Loran Data Channel 9th Pulse.  The proposed modulation scheme for this enhanced LORAN-C system may be reviewed at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/loran/9th-pulse-modulation-ldc.html .  The purpose of this modulation is to provide additional communications and allow for a concept of differential Loran to improve accuracy and integrity for both navigation and timing users. 

	4) Perform such that the LORAN-C system availability of 99.9%, as defined in the Federal Radio Navigation Plan, is achievable.  To meet this system availability, the transmitter portion of the system must be capable of meeting a higher level of availability.

	5) Interface with existing subsystems, these subsystems being Timer and Local and Remote Monitors.  The Timer generates the signals for pulse generation.  The Local and Remote Monitors interact with local and remote sites for command and control of the Loran Stations.  Summary Interfaces are described below: 

Timer Interface:  The primary signals from the timer are the clock and pulse triggers.    Five (5) MHz Clock signals are provided via TTL level line driver circuitry, with both high and low sides of the driver available to the transmitter.  The Pulse Trigger is the timing strobe that is provided to the transmitter to initiate the transmitter’s pulse generation circuitry.  The trigger signals are transformer coupled, with both high and low sides of the transformer output available to the transmitter.  One trigger is provided for each transmitted pulse.  The Timer subsystem maintains the timing necessary to accurately produce the Pulse Triggers.
	
Local and Remote Monitor Interfaces:
The Local and Remote Monitor use TCP/IP on both Ethernet based Local Area and Wide Area Networks to transfer time stamped messages representing commands (from Local and Remote Monitors), status information (including configuration, faults, alarms), and engineering data to and from the transmitter and the local and remote monitoring devices.

<SUBJECT>A -- OPERATIONALLY RESPONSIVE SPACE (ORS) PAYLOAD TECHNOLOGIES
<DESC>An industry briefing will be held at the Naval Research Laboratory(NRL), Washington,DC, on July 11, 2006 from 1:30 pm to 4:00 pm, in the Building B222 auditorium, first floor.  The purpose is to inform industry of an ORS Payload Technology development opportunity.  Congress has mandated that the Secretary of Defense (OSD) develop a process for coordinating Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) payload technology development. The OSDs Office of Force Transformation (OFT) is working with the NRL and MIT/Lincoln Lab (MIT/LL) to develop this ORS Payload Technology development process. To properly respond, current activities such as the ORS Bus Standards Development, the DoD ORS S and T Vector, TacSat Experimentation, and the general state and need of select technologies must be considered.  Investment options will be carefully evaluated considering unique ORS qualities which would likely prevent them from receiving investment through normal DoD or National means.  Proper consideration and investment will provide additional technologies to address Combatant Commander’s (COCOMs) operational concepts and needs. Primary transition of these ORS payload technologies is to Joint TacSat experimentation and/or directly to an ORS payload acquisition.  This initiative is also intended to help support the industrial base during this early ORS development period.
Process overview: MIT/LL is conducting an independent “quick look” assessment of payload technologies, factoring in the above and providing some initial priority areas to be presented at this industry day. NRL will provide a contracting officer(s) and officer representatives with expertise in the specific technology awarded as well as understanding of the broader ORS objectives.  OFT will oversee the prioritization process leveraging the technical expertise from across the DoD ORS community, including Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), MIT/LL, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), John Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL), NRL, and others to provide targeted investments in promising payload technologies while avoiding duplication with current S and T development efforts.  OFT will coordinate with STRATCOM to assure appropriate COCOM involvement and insight into these ORS technology investments.  A combination of NRL contracting methods may be used to support the innovative systems required for this effort; the primary mechanism will be NRL Broad Agency Announcement topic number BAA 82-05-01, Spacecraft Technology, which solicits a broad range of proposals for evaluation, award, and industry development.  The complete description of the topic can be located at the following website: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa.htm (scroll down the left pane to find the Naval Center of Space Technology BAAs, and this specific BAA).  The results of this ORS Payload Technology effort will advance the state of relevant technologies to provide a better selection of payload capabilities to meet COCOM needs.
Offerors who plan to attend must submit a visit request by June 31, 2006: Naval Research Laboratory, Attn: Code 3230:JR, Industry Briefing JR10, 4555 Overlook Avenue S.W, Washington, D.C. 20375.  Requests may be faxed to the following fax number, 202-767-6197. The visitor requests should be prepared on company letterhead and must contain the following information for each person attending:  Name, citizenship, purpose of visit.  Any substitutions/additions to visitor requests must be received 3 business days prior to the briefing. The classification level of the visit is "UNCLASSIFIED". During the briefing questions will be entertained and answered by NRL as well as OSD’s Office of Force Transformation and MIT/LL.  All attendees must abide by the following to attend the industry briefing: (a) One form of identification will be required (ie, drivers license). Due to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) restrictions no foreign nationals will be allowed to attend the Industry Briefing. (b) No cameras, cellular telephones with cameras, tape recorders, or other reproduction devices will be allowed.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) No. 06-14-AEDCPKP:  The Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T&E/S&T) development.   DTRMC seeks innovative proposals that will allow improved test and evaluation of current and future hypersonics systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to develop hypersonic flight systems or subsystems in this solicitation, but to investigate improved ground and flight test facilities, techniques and test methodologies that are needed to support hypersonic system/subsystem development.  This program does not support basic research, but rather the application and extension of technology to produce and understand a real or simulated flight environment.  The range of interest covers all hypersonic flight, both sustained flight in the atmosphere and the test environment of reentry vehicles.  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 1) INSTRUMENTATION FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TESTING OF HOT STRUCTURES.  This includes sensor and sensor integration techniques for in-flight measurement of surface and material temperatures, surface pressures, surface heat flux, structural strain and deformation, and surface ablation/recession, in and on carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials.  Measurement techniques must perform at temperature for up to two hours.  Techniques must not compromise the structural or thermal performance of the parent material.  2) SIMULATION OF MATERIAL ABLATION/EROSION AT HIGH VELOCITIES.  Vehicles which reenter the atmosphere or are exposed to high velocity sustained flight will likely encounter an environment which causes loss of surface material that can change the vehicle shape in an unpredictable manner.  Flight testing is very expensive and ground test facilities cannot provide the required flight simulation parameters, duration of test and model size to adequately investigate the phenomena.  This effort seeks to extend simulation techniques in ground test facilities wherein the test article material is selected to behave like carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials, but loses material in a reduced environment which can be provided in existing ground test facilities.  3) TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE A VARIABLE MACH FREE-JET TEST CAPABILITY.  There is a requirement for ground testing a complete hypersonic propulsion system wherein the Mach number is varied during a continuous facility run.  While facility temperatures and pressures can be properly varied, the facility nozzle which produces Mach number is deficient.  AEDC plans to build a variable Mach flexible wall nozzle to reach Mach 5 true-temperature test conditions.  It is believed that this maximizes technology for a two-dimensional free-jet nozzle.  The objective of this solicitation is to extend the variable Mach test capability to Mach 8.  This technology is anticipated for the Aerodynamic Propulsion Test Unit (APTU) facility at AEDC, however concepts that can be applied to other hypersonic test facilities will be considered.  4) COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF HYPERSONIC NOZZLE FLOWS.  In most hypersonic ground test facilities the test gas is energized in a plenum, expanded in a nozzle and then presented to a test article in a test chamber.  It is recognized that energy modes and gas species vary from an isentropic flow process in the rapidly expanding flow.  While the test gas is unlikely to duplicate the flight condition, knowledge of its composition will assist in interpretation of test data.  This effort seeks measurement and modeling of facility flow parameters with the intent of applying the results to a variety of hypersonic facility flows.  5) EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR HYPERSONIC SEPARATION DYNAMICS.  It is expected that next-generation hypersonic weapon systems will employ some type of armament/munitions separation during an aerodynamic maneuver from a carrier vehicle in hypersonic atmosphere flight.  A vast store of subsonic aircraft armament/munitions separation information is available.  Some hypersonic work was accomplished for the space shuttle separation issues several decades ago.  The objective of this solicitation is to investigate and identify flight phenomena incurred during body separation with the goal of simulating the environment with aerodynamic models in a hypersonic wind tunnel with a Captive Trajectory System (CTS).  Research in this topic should use the current state-of-the-art as a starting point and define those things that need to be improved or developed (e.g. dynamic force balance sensitivity to rapidly changing loads as the two-body shock-induced flow fields interact).

PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5 - $3.0M are expected to be made in FY07.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  Prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies.  DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is no a requirement.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well.  Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY08 or later and will be contingent on funds availability, merit of performance and previous phases, and anticipated future T&E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 30 Jun 17.  Each proposal should specify the benefits to U.S. military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the Phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T&E hypersonic need.

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding t he dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

EVALUATION:  Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1)  overall scientific and technical merit, (2)  relevance to current T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror’s capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonic Test Working Group, through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .PDF format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332.

Statement of Work/Specifications

A.1 Introduction:
The U.S.Department of Commerce(DOC),National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA),Aircraft Operations Center (AOC),MacDill AFB,Florida, intends to exchange four T56-A-14 engines in “as is” condition with complete logbooks for one, 0.0 hour(all modules) Time Since Overhaul (TSO)T56-A-14 engine in “Ready for Installation”(RFI) condition with logbooks and two,overhauled to zero time PT6A-27 engines with logbooks.

A.2 Background:	
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operate two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. Four Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines power each WP-3D.  NOAA also operates a fleet of four DeHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine. Currently, NOAA has two spare, RFI T56-A-14 engines. With the projected acquisition of a third P-3C, NOAA anticipates the requirement for one additional spare,0.0 hour Time Since Overhaul(TSO),RFI T56-A-14 engine. Additionally, NOAA does not have any spare zero time engines for the fleet of Twin Otters. With the ever increasing amount of annual flight hours flown by these aircraft,it would be in NOAA’s best interest to have two spare,0.0 hour TSO PT6A-27 engines. The NOAA AOC in Tampa, Florida,manages these aircraft.

A.3 Scope:

3.  A hand controller with clearly labeled keys must be provided for manually controlling the monochromator.
4.  The monochromator must have an optical design capable of holding three gratings simultaneously which are selectable via computer/remote control.  The system must be delivered with a minimum of 2 ruled gratings (each having 600 l/mm or more and peak efficiency greater than 60 percent) which permit full coverage of the 200 nm to 2500 nm spectral range.
5.  The monochromator must have an automated fixed slit wheels (3 total) having a minimum of 8 slots and configured/delivered with at least 8 fixed width apertures for each wheel (ranging in slit width from 50  micrometer to greater than 3 millimeter) for the one (1) entrance and two (2) exit ports. 
6.  The monochromator must have an automated spectral filter wheel with a minimum of 6 filter slots and configured/delivered with a minimum of four (4) filters to cover the 200 nm to 2500 nm spectral range. 
7.  UV Optical grade and mounting components (necessary collimation, focusing, f-matching and/or light shielding/tube) for coupling light from a broad band light source (lamp housing) or fiber optic cable (FC connection with less than 100 micrometer diameter fiber core) to the monochromator must be included as part of the total monochromator system.
8.  UV Optical grade and mounting components (necessary collimation, focusing, and/or f-matching) for coupling light from one exit port (minimum) to the sample and radiometer/detector, i.e. collimation of light from monochromator exit port, beam splitter(s) for sampling light with the radiometer/detector, and focusing optics for input to a fiber optic cable (FC connection with less than 100 m diameter fiber core) or directly onto the sample must be included as part of the total monochromator system.

Illumination Source Requirements

SITE TOUR Video Surveillance System  ESQ060022 A site tour was held June 12, 2006, at the Interagency Fire Dispatch Center, Billings, Mt., for the video surveillance system.

What is the delivery time for this requirement?  Delivery will be 30 days from date of award. 4. Are there any indoor cameras needed?  No indoor cameras are required. 5.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This hereby constitutes issuance of Amendments 02 – 04 to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092.  All offerors shall acknowledge receipt and acceptance of said amendments in their proposal to include Amendment 01 issued May 30, 2006 via FedBizOpps.  The following are questions and answers submitted by interested parties.  There were 79 questions submitted in total.  Amendment 02 will include Questions 1 – 26, Amendment 03 will include Questions 27 -53, and Amendment 04 will include Questions 54 - 79.



1.	Search as I have, I have not been able to find the exact NAICS code referred to on page 52 and 62 in the RFP. On page 62 it mentions we will see the Code # on the SF1449 which I could not find in our package. Could you please help me with either the SF1449 or at a minimum the NAICS code that the RFP references?

The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 541690 -- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The purpose of the NAICS code is for the small business subcontracting goals as addressed in Section M.  There is no SF1449.

2.	At the Industry Day, I posed the question of whether or not the incumbent has the positions filled at the positions filled at the Mobile Support Centers.  In answer to my question, I may have misunderstood, but I thought Mr. Grubbs stated that no positions were filled as of yet and the only staff in place was the TSA staff.  However, in the minutes of this discussion, as show below, the answer to my question is still unclear.  Would you please clarify whether or not the incumbent has all the positions listed in the SOW filled at the Mobile Support Centers?

“6. Are there contractor personnel in place at the Mission Support Centers now?

Yes there are.  TSA currently has 5 mission support centers (MSCs) located in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit and San Francisco.  Two are GSA leased space and the other three are leased through a contractor.” 

At this time, the incumbent does utilize the Mission Support Centers (MSC), located in the above Metropolitan areas, for their personnel as contracted.  The positions listed in the SOW for this RFP are different than the position requirements for the incumbent.

3.	As understood, a hazards analysis has been conducted of TSA’s screening operations and working environments under a separate contract. With input from this hazards analysis, or prior to, has a comprehensive safety and health manual been developed and, if so, is it now in place at all TSA locations and Mobile Support Centers?

An OSH Manual is currently in development.  We expect updates will be required under the new contract.

4.	Reference RFP Section L.1, b. Proposals shall be submitted on single sided, 8 ½” x 11” paper, with a font size no smaller than 12 points. May the offeror submit graphics on 11x17 foldout pages? May a font size of 10 points be used in graphics or text tables?

No, all documentation or graphics must be submitted on single sided, 8 ½” x 11” paper.  All font size inclusive of text tables, headers and footers, and text used with graphics must be no smaller than 12 points. 

5.	Reference RFP Section L.1, g. To aid in the evaluations, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written as well as neat, indexed (cross-indexed as appropriate) and logically assembled in the sequence specified in Section L2 of this RFP.  By indexed, does the Government require a table of contents to the fourth level or alternatively, an alphabetized list of RFP words or subjects giving the page or pages on which each item is mentioned? By cross-indexed, does the Government mean that the offeror should insert cross-references of related proposal paragraphs into the text or alternatively, a matrix of proposal responses relevant to RFP requirements? Where should the offeror place the index in the proposal volume sequence? Will the index page count be excluded from the page limitations due to the size of indexing requirements?

The Government does not require a table of  Please refer to question 62.

64.	Does the Program Manager have to be located at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA?  If not, how often will he/she be required to travel?

Please refer to question 42.  It will be up to the discretion of the offeror whether the Program Manager will need to travel.

It is hereby clarified that local routine travel (within a 25 mile radius of the TSA Headquarters and TSA Field Organizations) is not reimbursable.

65.	Section 2.2.2 Staffing states that “one team lead will be based at each of the five (5) Field Support Center offices and one based at TSA Headquarters.”  Please better define the term “based.”  Will the team leads have to report to these offices daily, or will they only have to report to these offices on a less frequent basis?  If so, what percentage of time will the team leads be out of the office vs. in the office?  Will the team leads have to live in the cities where the Field Support Centers are based if significant travel is required?

Please refer to Section C Paragraph 3.1 Facilities, Supplies, and Services.  Office space will be provided at the Mission Support Centers and may be utilized as necessary.  The necessary use or the requirement to report to these offices daily will be up to the discretion of the contractor.  Please refer to question 25, 52, and Amendment 01.

66.	The Key Personnel are identified as the Program Manager and 6 certified OSH Specialists/Team Leads.  The technical proposal can contain up to 10 resumes.  What 3 resume beyond the 7 key people does the TSA want to see in the proposal?

As stated, the technical proposal can contain up to 10 resumes and therefore the 3 resumes beyond the 6 key personnel do not need to be utilized.  It is up to the discretion of the offeror whether they would like to submit resumes for the other staff members to enhance the technical proposal.

67.	Please clarify whether the Draft Project Plan is a required component of the Technical Proposal.  The Work Products/Outcomes Summary Table on page 13 of the Solicitation specifies that a draft of this document is due "with proposal", it is not specified in the list of required elements of the Technical Proposal in section L.2 (page 57).  If a Draft Project Plan is a required component of the Technical Proposal, please specify if it will be included in the overall 30-page limitation, or any other page limitations.

The Draft Project Plan is required in the technical proposal as part of the Management and Staffing Plan (See Section L.2 Number 3b) and will be included in the overall 30-page limitation.

68.	Section L.3.d of the Solicitation specifies that a "mitigation plan, as defined in Section K of the RFP" must be included in the Technical Proposal.  However, no mention of this plan is included in Section K.  Please clarify where the definition for this plan can be found.

Please refer to question 15.

69.	Section M.3.10 of the Solicitation states that one of the evaluation factors of the Price Proposal will be "travel costs estimates".  As travel costs have been pre-determined as NTE values in Section B, please clarify how these can be an evaluation factor. 

Please refer to question 25.

70.	How should the base year be costed, given that the winning contractor does not have to fill the non-key positions for up to 60 days?  Should the costing assume all 30 personnel will be on staff for the full year?

Yes, costing shall assume all 30 personnel will be on staff for the full period of performance.  All positions shall be fully staffed on October 2, 2006.  Please refer to question 12.

71.	Are the NTE values for ODCs and travel realistic (contract ceilings), or are they estimates used to normalize the bids?  Why weren’t the NTE values escalated?

The Not to Exceed values for ODCs and Travel are realistic and escalation had not been factored into the ceiling.  Please refer to question 25.

72.	The TSA is requesting that proposals be submitted 1 week after clarifications are posted.  Will an extension be considered?

An extension for receipt of proposals will not be considered.  Proposal shall be due June 22, 2006 at 2:00 pm EST.

73.	Section C. 2. Project Background and Objective: Is the contractor going to be given sufficient training on the SIS and SPP, or is it assumed that the contractor will have current knowledge of the TSA’s SIS SPP? 

The Contractor will be given sufficient training on the SIS, but no training will be necessary or is required for the SPP program. Please refer to question 38.

74.	Section C. 2.2.2.: Can the Government please clarify weather the staffing listed are all Full Time?

Please refer to question 62 and 63.

75.	Section C. 5.4.2. Travel and Per Diem: Only audit approved General and Administrative (G&A) Overhead Rates may be applied to travel. Should this be Indirect Rates many be applied to travel? Are we to assume that not Fee can be applied to travel and per diem?

Only G&A is authorized.  Please delete the verbiage Overhead Rates from Section C 5.4.2.

76.	Section H. 3.8.2-17 (g): There are no key personnel listed. Is this an error? 

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP where it states what TSA envisions as Key Staff Members.  Please refer to question 16.

77.	Section L. 3.: 10 Resumes at referenced as the maximum. Does the government view that there are 10 key personnel on this contract? 

Please refer to question 62 and 76.

78.	Section L. 4.: In regards to transition of incumbent personnel, can the government identify the number of incumbent personnel, their roles and responsibilities, and their locations? 

Please refer to question 2 and 40.

79.	General: Can the government clarify 

Yes, the Government can clarify any issues offerors may have.  Please refer to question 58.

<DESC>This hereby constitutes issuance of Amendment 03 to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092.  


27.	SF 1449.  Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors, under L.9 (3.2.2.5-1) Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items) states that, “Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.” The solicitation does not appear to have been issued with this cover sheet. Will TSA provide a SF 1449 for the solicitation?

Please refer to question 17.  

28.	Currency of Past Performance for Small Business.  Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors, under L.2 (6.) Past Performance) states that the past performance should have been performed during the past three years. Can this requirement be extended to five years for Small Businesses, given that SBs often do not perform the volume of project work of larger firms?

No, the requirement for past performance can not be extended to five years for Small Businesses.

29.	Proposal Page Limit.  Section L (Proposal Preparation Instructions) states that the Offeror’s technical proposal will contain eight sections and will be limited to 30 pages.  The instructions exclude five sections from the 30-page limit (i.e., Quality Assurance and Control Plan—10 pages, Resumes—20 pages, Mitigation Plan—2 pages, Sample Final Report—20 pages, and Draft Award Fee Plan—15 pages).  Are the cover page, cover letter, table of contents excluded from this page limitation?

Please refer to question 22. 

30.	Font Size for Proposal.  Section L (Proposal Preparation Instructions) states that the proposal will be submitted “with a font size no smaller than 12 points.”  Does this font size apply to tables, charts, graphics, and images too?

Please refer to question 4.

31.	Program Manager vs. Project Manager.  Section C (Statement of Work) defines requirement for the Program Manager position.  Section F (Deliveries or Performance) refers to ‘the contractor’s designated Project Manager” (e.g., Clause G.1, Page 23 of 76).  Are the Program Manager and Project Manager one in the same?

The title Program Manager, as stated in the SOW, and the contractor’s designated Project Manager, as stated in Section F, are interchangeable.  As stated at Industry Day, TSA would like to reiterate that this is a program and not a project.

32.	Since the AMS encourages use of the GSA Federal Supply Schedules, will the TSA entertain proposal of GSA Professional Engineering Schedule or MOBIS fixed unit rate pricing in lieu of a firm fixed price contract?  

This requirement has been solicited as a full and open competition and therefore TSA will not be utilizing any GSA schedule to award the contract.

33.	There is some ambiguity in the RFP in that Section H2 states that the award fee performance plan shall be unilaterally developed by the Government, yet a draft performance evaluation plan needs to be submitted with the proposal (Section M, Paragraph 9)?  Please clarify.

The statements in this question are not correct.  Section H2 of the RFP states that a Performance Evaluation Plan shall be unilaterally established by the Government.  Section M, Paragraph 9 of the RFP states that the offeror shall provide a Draft Award Fee Plan within the technical proposal.  

34.	Will the TSA consider an individual who is a Certified Health Physicist (CHP) as a lead?  In our business (Department of Energy facility operations), our CHPs perform duties similar to CSP and CIH personnel.  

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP and question 9.  A CHP may be considered provided the individual meets the requirements as outlined.

35.	What does the TSA consider as Other Direct Costs (ODCs)?  

ODCs can include purchase of testing equipment, copying and printing, and lab analysis.  Please refer to question 18, 19, and 25.

36.	We typically use our customer’s QA program in lieu of our own so that there is no additional work on the customer to review and approve our program.  However, we have used our program when the customer has requested.  Is there a TSA QA program that may wish to be invoked instead?

There is not a TSA QA program; therefore Offerors shall provide a Quality Assurance Plan to be used for the life of the contract.

37.	What is the regional responsibility breakdown vice the new “three region” concept?  i.e. what airports are the responsibility of each region?

Please refer to the List of TSA Field Organizations provided as Attachment 1 of Section J.  This list includes the TSA regional areas.

38.	Who are the companies that lead the Hazard Analysis, SIS and SPP contracts?  How is interaction with these companies to be managed?

There is currently one Hazard Analysis contractor, one SIS contractor, and numerous SPP contractors.  The names of these companies are irrelevant to this procurement.  Interaction will only occur for use of the SIS and this interaction will be managed by the COTR.

39.	How will the Key Personnel and OSH Specialists complete a favorable background investigation before they are on contract, what is the process that TSA intends to use?  Will TSA conduct the background checks for Key Personnel once the contract is awarded or will the Awardee be responsible? 

Upon award, the COTR will provide the necessary information to the selected contractor to allow for the completion of security paperwork.  All personnel will complete and submit paperwork through TSA’s electronic means (http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/) and TSA will conduct the full background investigation.

40.	How many Safety Professionals are currently supporting each of the five Field support centers, how many are CSPs and CIHs?

As stated during the Industry Day Briefing, the current contract is significantly different that this procurement. Please refer to question 2.

41.	Who from TSA will receive resumes and evaluate the experience of new hires?  How long will this process take before prospective hires will be approved by TSA?  What are the specific criteria to be used for approval so that only approvable personnel will be presented?

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP.

42.	Will the Program Manager be a TSA-site position since there are only 4 workstations at HQ?

TSA does not envision the need for the Program Manager to be on-site at TSA HQ.

43.	What is the level of travel (%) that TSA anticipates for the Team Leaders and OSH Specialists located at the TSA Field support centers?

Please refer to question 25.

44.	Will there be any available space at airport locations from which OSH Specialist may work?

Due to security issues, no arrangements have been made for space at this time.

45.	Does TSA have a current list of all documents at both HQ and in the field that have been generated during the initiation of its OSH program?

Documentation will be made available to the awardee as necessary after all Non-Disclosure Agreements have been signed and provided to TSA.

46.	For transition purposes, how will TSA ensure that its OSH documentation is available to a new OSH support contractor?  Will the data be available to the new contractor after the award date to help with a smooth transition of work?

Please refer to question 45.

47.	Does TSA currently have a master calendar of all required events at HQ and in the field to help ensure a smooth transition of activities?

No.  Both a project plan and transition plan shall be provided as part of the offeror’s proposal.

48.	What are the current performance measures that OMB is using to measure the TSA OSH program?

The TSA OBM initiative is focused on reducing injury rates.

49.	Will the Performance Evaluation Plan noted in H.2 be based on the Draft Award Fee Plan submitted with the proposal?

The Performance Evaluation Plan will be unilaterally developed taking into consideration the negotiated Award Fee Plan provided by the contractor.

50.	Can the font for tables and matrices be less that 12 point as long as it is still legible?

Please refer to question 4.

51.	Can client specific information be redacted from the sample plan that will be submitted with the proposal?

Yes, provided that the Sample Final Report can still be clearly interpreted.

52.	Does new personnel have to live within the geographic area they support? 

No, personnel does not have to live within the geographic area they support provided it is cost effective for that staff member to travel to the area he/she will support.

53.	After award, under what conditions can a contractor replace the key personnel proposed as the Program Manager and Team Leads? 

Please refer to TSAAMS Clause 3.8.2-17 Key Personnel (April 2006) found in Section H.26.

<DESC>This hereby constitutes issuance of Amendment 04 to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092.  


54.	Under what conditions can a contractor change key personnel between submission of the technical proposal and the orals? 

TSA does not have any authority to stop the change of key personnel between the time of proposal submission and oral presentations.  Any changes to proposed resumes must be submitted as a formal clarification to the proposal, no later than one (1) week prior to the offerors scheduled oral presentation.  All new resumes will be evaluated based on Section M.3 Management and Staffing Approach.

55.	Section M.3, 10 - Price Proposal indicates that Travel cost estimates will be evaluated, however the instructions do not provide any information regarding the travel estimates required or the level of travel anticipated.  Please clarify.

Please refer to question 25.

56.	It appears that the transition period will be the first month of the base year.  Should pricing detail be provided for the transition period, separate from the remaining 11 months of the base period, including an estimate of transition travel?

No. Please refer to question 12.

57.	If tab dividers are used to separate proposal attachments, do the tab sheets count toward the individual attachment not to exceed page limit?  

No.
58.	The RFP  (Section L.6, page 61) lists the cut-off date for questions as June 13.  However, the FedBizOps announcement lists the cutoff date as June 14.  Will the TSA entertain additional questions on June 14?

No, both the RFP and the synopsis on FedBizOps states that the cut-off date for questions is June 13, 2006 and all answers will be posted on June 14, 2006.  TSA will not entertain questions after June 13, 2006. 

59.	The government-furnished equipment listed in Attachment 3 of the Solicitation does not include all items commonly-used for employee exposure assessment activities.  For example, items notably absent in that attachment include noise dosimeters and personal air sampling pumps and apparatus.  Can it be assumed that if devices other than those listed in Attachment 3 become necessary to support the objectives of any resulting contract, that such items (or of any other items of equipment  that become necessary) would either be provided by the TSA or would be reimbursed at suitably burdened costs (above the submitted fixed price total)?

Please refer to question 18, 19, and 25.

60.	If any laboratory analytical services become necessary to support the resulting contract, can it be assumed that any costs for these services would either be borne directly by the TSA, or be reimbursed at suitably burdened costs (above the submitted fixed price total)?

Please refer to question 19.

61.	What "milestones" and "timelines" should be addressed in the Draft Project Plan, which is a required component of the technical proposal?

TSA is requiring the offerors to use their professional judgment in establishing milestones and timelines based on requirements in the Statement of Work. 

62.	Please clarify Section C, subsection 5.2 of the solicitation.  Beyond the one Certified OSH Specialist Team Lead (specified in 2.2.2 of that same section), are there any other contractor employees "required to work at TSA Headquarters located in Arlington, VA"?  Also, is it expected that this will involve full-time, dedicated assignments at this location, including the labor costs associated with such assignments?

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP, specifically the recommended minimum acceptable staffing requirements listed.

63.	Will the Program Manager position be a full-time, dedicated position for this contract?  Are all the other staff required for this contract (6 certified OSH Specialists/Team Leads, 22 OSH Specialists, 1 QA/Technical Writer) also fully dedicated to this contract?

It is envisioned that the Program Manager and all staff will be fully dedicated to this contract. contents or an alphabetized list of RFP words or subjects, but including these in the technical proposal will be left to the discretion of the offeror.  If the offeror believes the use of these techniques will provide a more clear and concise proposal and demonstrates the type of work product produced by the offeror, then it would be beneficial.  

Cross-indexed means both that the offeror is encouraged to insert cross-references of related proposal paragraphs into the text and include a matrix of proposal responses relevant to RFP requirements.  Again this is not required and therefore it should be included as a enhancement in your technical volume to be included in the page limitation.

6.	RFP section L.2-2 requires bidders to submit a draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. Is this a plan for Government surveillance of the contractor’s work (as specified in FAR 46.4), or is this a plan for contractor surveillance of its own work? If neither, what is it? How does the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan relate to and differ from the Performance Evaluation Plan described in RFP section H.2?

The required Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a plan for the offeror to provide the Government their specific procedures of how the contractor will conduct surveillance of its own work.  The QASP is different than the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) in that the PEP will detail how the contractor shall be evaluated to earn the award fee.

7.	RFP section I, in the subsection that incorporates TSAAMS 1.13-5, Contractor Quality Control, says that the contractor’s Quality Control Plan must “detail how survey administration will be tracked and maintained.” Does this refer to the industrial hygiene survey reports referenced in section 2.2.1.2(x) of the Statement of Work, to the customer satisfaction surveys referenced in section 2.2.4.1 in the Statement of Work, or to some other surveys? Please specify.

The Contractor Quality Control Plan is for the overall administration of the entire contract.

8.	Section L.2 refers to the Resumes of Key Personnel, Sample Final Report, Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, Quality Assurance Control Plan, Award Fee Plan, and Mitigation Plan as “attachments.” Does this mean that they must be grouped together at the end of the document, after the sections that fall in the 30-page limit? Or must they be assembled in the numbered sequence specified in Section L.2, interspersed among the sections that fall in the 30-page limit?

All attachments that are excluded from the 30 page limitation should be grouped together at the end of the technical volume after the section that fall within the 30 page limit.

9.	Reference Page 11 of 76, Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing. GS-018 which is cited at this location in the RFP “requires as a minimum 4 year degree in OSH and 3 years experience, 1 year of which was equivalent to at least GS-4, in scientific or technical work that provided and understanding of the basic principles and concepts of the safety and health field.  Creditable general experience must have demonstrated the achievement of knowledge equivalent to the education described above.”  Will TSA accept a GS-5 level person?  What is the acceptable criteria for OSH Specialists on this contract?  GS-5, 7, 9, 11, 12 or above? 

Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP shall hereby be amended to state:
OSH Specialists assigned to the OSH support services contract must fit the description set forth in 29 CFR 1960.2(s).  That is, OSH Specialists must meet POM standards for Safety and Occupational Health Manager, GS-0018.

The minimum acceptable criteria for OSH Specialist working under a Team Lead would be those listed in OPM Publication T-55(8/81) for a GS 0018-09.  Note the SOW used GS-0018 as an example of occupations listed under 29 CFR 1960.s(s).  A GS-690 Industrial Hygienist may also serve as an OSH Specialist, provided the minimum acceptable criteria are similar to those identified for a GS-0018-09.

10.	Reference Page 15 of 76, Paragraph 3.1 Government Furnished Resources/Facilities, Supplies, and Services and Page 41 of 76, Paragraph 3.10.3-11 Contractor's Maintenance Program: Ref. "Contractor will be responsible for maintaining TSA owned equipment issued for Contractor use, including calibration when necessary," and Clause 3.10.3-11: Please confirm the costs associated with maintenance and calibration of Government Owned Equipment will be covered in the ODC Line Item?

No, the costs associated with maintenance and calibration of Government Owned Equipment will be covered in the basic fixed-price CLIN that encompasses all requirements under the SOW.  It will be required of the Contractor to provide the Government with an annual certification of calibrations for all applicable equipment. Please refer to question 18.

11.	Reference Page 24 of 76, Paragraph G.2 Payment Schedule: What are the "required documentation" that must be provided with the Contractor's invoices?

The required documentation to be included in the invoice is listed within TSAAMS clause 3.3.1-17 Prompt Payment (January 2003).  The Contractor will also be required to submit any documentation in support of ODCs and travel, such as receipts in concurrence with the Federal Travel Regulations.  

12.	Reference Page 25 of 76, Paragraph G.4 Preparation of invoices, G.5 Prompt Payment, and page 76 of 76, Paragraph M.6 TSA Clauses, 3.3.1-30 Progress Payments Not Included: Please identify how the Contractor is to invoice on a monthly basis for this FFP contract; e.g., for labor a fixed amount per month based on total Labor divided by 12 months, plus incurred ODCs and Travel at cost?

Yes, it is envisioned that for labor, the invoicing will be 1/12th the annual price PROVIDED the contract has fully staffed the requirement as solicited for performance to begin October 2, 2006.  Travel and any approved ODCs will be billed for the prior month. Please refer to question 70.

Please note the correction that the Period of Performance for this contract will begin on October 2, 2006.  Therefore, please replace the POP starting date of October 1, 2006 with the corrected POP starting date of October 2, 2006 throughout the RFP.

13.	Can I assume the NAICS Code for this procurement is 541690, size limit of $6.5M?

That is correct. However, please see question 1.

14.	Section L.1 Proposal Preparation Instructions – General (page 56 of 76) – items b and d conflict regarding the number of copies.  Do you require an original hard copy plus three copies, or an original plus four copies?

Please provide one original hard copy plus three copies.  Therefore Section L.1 item d shall hereby be amended to state:

d.	Copy number one of the proposal shall contain the signed original of all documents requiring signature by the Offeror.  Use of reproductions of signed originals is authorized for the remaining three copies of the proposal.  


15.	Section L.3.d, Management and Staffing Approach Mitigation Plan (page 58 of 76) – “Offerors shall submit a mitigation plan, as defined in Section K of the RFP.”  The reference to mitigation in Section K is limited to discussion of disqualification of the offer.  Is this correct or should the definition reference be Section L.8 TSA Clauses 3.1.7-4 Organizational Conflicts of Interest Provision-Short Form (page 66 of 76)?

The mitigation plan should be submitted as defined in both Section K.4 3.1.7.5 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (FEBRUARY 2003) and section L.8 3.1.7-4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISION-SHORT FORM (FEBRUARY 2003).  The CO will determine if a mitigation plan is acceptable for any identified OCI’s.

16.	Section L.5 of the solicitation indicates that presenters at the orals must be the key personnel who will perform the work.  Section 2.2.2 notes that the Program Manager and Team Leads (7 personnel) are key staff members.  May we assume that TSA only requires a representative number of the key personnel at orals?

No, TSA requires all key personnel to be present at the orals.  Please note the clarification that Key Staff Members is the same as Key Personnel.

17.	Section L.8, TSA Clauses – Clause 3.2.2.5-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (page 62 of 76) references the SF 1449.  Is there a Standard Form 1449 available for this solicitation?

No, there is not a SF1449 available for this solicitation.  This form will be included in the award document.

18.	In Attachment 3 TSA provided a GFE list.  Will TSA purchase additional equipment, if required, or will the contractor be required to purchase additional equipment?  Will additional equipment be purchased under the ODC CLIN 004 in Section B cost schedule?  For example, will TSA purchase video recorders?

Additional equipment can be purchased under CLIN 0004: Other Direct Costs, if deemed necessary by TSA. Calibration of new equipment will be purchased under CLIN 0004: ODCs.  Insurance for all equipment including the Government Furnished Equipment shall be provided by the contractor.

19.	Will laboratory analyses cost be incurred under this contract?  Will laboratory costs be purchased under the OCS CLIN 004 in Section B cost schedule?

TSA currently has a separate contract for laboratory analysis. TSA will however, authorize laboratory costs under CLIN 0004: Other Direct Costs, if deemed necessary.

20.	Please clarify the format of the response under Technical Section 2.0 - Quality Assurance and Control Plan.  Should this be a brief summary of the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and Quality Assurance Control Plan (QACP) with references to the separate attachments for the Draft QASP and Draft QACP?

No summary is necessary.  Offerors shall only submit a draft QASP and QACP as an attachment to the technical volume.  As stated, these are excluded from page limitation but shall not exceed 5 pages.

21.	Is the 20 page limit for a sample report inclusive of all title pages, table of contents, appendices etc.

Yes.

22.	We assume that the title page and TOC of the technical proposal do not count against the 30-page limit, is that correct?

That is correct. However, please also refer to question 5.

23.	Number of copies - Par. L.1.b states that an original, 3 copies and an electronic copy are required.  Par. L.1.d refers to copy number one which shall contain all signed original documents, and that reproductions of signed originals are authorized for the 4 remaining copies.  Would you please clarify this requirement?

Please refer to question 14.  
 
24.	Number of past performance references - Par. 6 states that "past performance information should include at least three specific contract references for both the Offeror and any teaming partners." Does this require us to submit at least 3 references for Prime Contractor and also at least 3 references for all teaming partners, or do you want at least 3 in total?

We ask for a minimum of three (3) past performance references total, but you may provide as many as you would like for each team member or subcontractor.     Please ensure you are providing enough applicable information. 

25.	Estimating Travel Expenses and Other Direct Costs.  Section M.3 (Evaluation Factors, under 10.a. Price Proposal) states that evaluation criteria will include, “Travel cost estimates regardless of the travel ceiling provided.”  Section H.23 Contractor Justification for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) states, “The Contractor shall include a detailed description of all proposed ODCs in the contract proposal.  Section H specifies ODCs to exclude travel.”  Section B (Schedule of Pricing) provides not-to-exceed figures for ODCs and Travel.  Are we to use the Section B. figures, as given, for ODCs and Travel totals in our price proposal, or are we to develop our own estimates for ODCs and Travel?  If we are to develop our own estimates, will TSA provide additional information to assist us in developing our estimates to ensure comparability of price proposals (e.g., number of trips per year to specific destinations, lengths of trips, classes of ODCs, levels of activity in classes of ODCs, etc.)?  For those factors that are unknown, can TSA provide a basis for estimating pricing (e.g., number of mishaps to be investigated per year and where, number of industrial hygiene samples to be taken per year and where, copies of training materials to be provided per year, etc.)? Additionally, will TSA expand on the statement in Section H.23, “The Contractor shall utilize Government supply sources when available, including the mandatory-for-consideration DHS commodity contracts as directed by the COTR.” What are the contract numbers for these contracts? What types of commodities are provided through these contracts? How will we purchase commodities from them, as contractors?

Section B numbers as Not to Exceed shall govern for award.  TSA requires the offeror to propose anticipated travel and ODC (name, cost, and justification) costs within the pricing proposal which will be evaluated to determine if fair and reasonable and substantiate the contractor’s clear understanding of the requirements to include complexity and scope as related to the offerors technical approach.  Section H.23 is a standard statement in procurements but is not applicable to this contract at this time. Please refer to question 18 and 19.

Section M.10 Price Proposal is hereby amended to state (bullet 4):
•	Travel and ODC cost estimates regardless of the ceilings provided.

Please note the clarification that all option year’s ODCs and travel CLINs will be escalated by 5% annually.  Section B.1 Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) is hereby amended as such:

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Proposals is to procure necessary materials and provide construction services to reconstruct, rehabilitate, and/or renovate significant portions of the national highway from Banda Aceh – Meulaboh on behalf of USAID/Indonesia.  The required services will be under the USAID/Indonesia Aceh Tsunami Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program.  This Program is intended to provide assistance in rehabilitation, livelihood, and rebuilding of economic and social infrastructure in Aceh and North Sumatra provinces damaged by the December 26, 2004 earthquake and tsunami. 

This is an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The Government will issue lump sum, fixed-price, fixed-unit price, or hybrid lump sum/fixed-unit price task orders.  The Contractor must perform the services set forth in these task orders at prices consistent with this Contract.  

The originally proposed overall Project scope includes reconstruction of the road from Banda Aceh (starting from the zero kilometer marker opposite to the Grand Mosque) to the Meulaboh city center monument.  The total extent of the road is approximately 240 kilometers.  The current right of way (ROW) is approximately 20 meters wide along the existing road alignment.  Due to the significant damage to the existing road and bridges and where landmasses have been altered significantly, several sections of the original road will be realigned.  Furthermore, most of the bridges and crossings are to be reconstructed. 

The new reconstructed road shall be 7 meters wide with typically 2-meter shoulders.  The right of way of 30 to 40 meters will be established by the GOI for the new road.  In addition to the construction of the road, an additional objective of this assistance plan is to provide employment opportunities and capacity building for the Indonesians and Acehnese.  Hence, the construction contractor shall endeavor to extend opportunities to Indonesian/Acehnese firms and individuals as much as feasible. 

Amendment#1 
USAID/Indonesia is hereby amending the Subject RFP.
Please see the attached Amendment #1.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reestablish the response date to include the following questions and answers.

Q1.  For the purposes of clarification, please confirm that the terms Customer and Navy are one and the same.
A1.  Yes.
Q2.  Please confirm if the end wall panels shall consist of two flaps with 5 ft seams or a series of 5 ft wide flaps with grommets.
A2.  End panels need to be a series of 5 ft wide flaps with grommets.
Q3.  We notice the rail wheels are to be furnished with castors. Is this so the shelter can be rolled around off the rails?
A3.  The shelter only needs track rollers for the purpose of rolling back and forth for assembly.
Q4.  For anchoring purposes advise if the wheels shall be retractable. If not please advise if the wheel exposure height shall be included in the overall height of the structure.
A4.  Wheels do not need to be retractable, and as far as the wheel exposure height it can be
included in the overall height to the structure. We have to have 45 ft height for clearance.
Q5.  Again for anchoring purposes please confirm type of anchor. We assume concrete expansion or epoxy anchors will be acceptable.
A5.  As far as anchoring NNSY can use keel blocks, cables & turnbuckles.
Q6.  When in use will the shelter ride on piers and straddle open water or will it be shore bound.
A6.  The shelter will not straddle open water, it will be totally on the pier.
Q7.  The faxed sketch appears to show two buildings nested over one another, with two pairs of rails.  Does the building need to pass over or under an existing structure?  It appears that the new building fits inside another building.
A7.  Shelter will be one section 60 ft long X 84 ft wide X 45 ft high.
Q8.  Are the 100 lb crane rail wheel and caster assembly fixed non-castering wheels, meant to only travel in a straight line?  Will uplift and kickout forces be taken by these wheels and transferred into the rails?  
A8.  Yes we only need to travel in a straight line, if we use 4 keel blocks one on each end and
anchor the shelter after moving each time, I think this will take care of any up lift problem.
Q9.  How many foot candles in the lighting system?
A9.  A lighting system is not needed, NNSY will install temporary lighting.
Q10.  How fixed is the delivery date of July 1, 2006?  We will meet the date if necessary but typically prefer 4 weeks to deliver.
A10.  The Project need date is July 17, 2006.
Q11. The description indicates the gable end manufactured in 5 ft wide vertical strips with grommets on all sides.  Do these panels need to fasten to one another or to the gable steelwork with rope? Do they want steel in the gable end walls? If so, does it need to be easily removable?
A11.  It is the projects desire that the ends be 5 ft wide vertical strips with grommets so that 
they can be easily tied to each side or easily removed in order to clear structure when moving
the shelter back and forth.

Q8.  Are the 100 lb crane rail wheel and caster assembly fixed non-castering wheels, meant to only travel in a straight line?  Will uplift and kickout forces be taken by these wheels and transferred into the rails?  
A8.  Yes we only need to travel in a straight line, if we use 4 keel blocks one on each end and
anchor the shelter after moving each time, I think this will take care of any up lift problem.
Q9.  How many foot candles in the lighting system?
A9.  A lighting system is not needed, NNSY will install temporary lighting.
Q10.  How fixed is the delivery date of July 1, 2006?  We will meet the date if necessary but typically prefer 4 weeks to deliver.
A10.  The Project need date is July 17, 2006.
Q11. The description indicates the gable end manufactured in 5 ft wide vertical strips with grommets on all sides.  Do these panels need to fasten to one another or to the gable steelwork with rope? Do they want steel in the gable end walls? If so, does it need to be easily removable?
A11.  It is the projects desire that the ends be 5 ft wide vertical strips with grommets so that 
they can be easily tied to each side or easily removed in order to clear structure when moving
the shelter back and forth.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reestablish the response date to include the following questions and answers.

Q1.  For the purposes of clarification, please confirm that the terms Customer and Navy are one and the same.
A1.  Yes.
Q2.  Please confirm if the end wall panels shall consist of two flaps with 5 ft seams or a series of 5 ft wide flaps with grommets.
A2.  End panels need to be a series of 5 ft wide flaps with grommets.
Q3.  We notice the rail wheels are to be furnished with castors. Is this so the shelter can be rolled around off the rails?
A3.  The shelter only needs track rollers for the purpose of rolling back and forth for assembly.
Q4.  For anchoring purposes advise if the wheels shall be retractable. If not please advise if the wheel exposure height shall be included in the overall height of the structure.
A4.  Wheels do not need to be retractable, and as far as the wheel exposure height it can be
included in the overall height to the structure. We have to have 45 ft height for clearance.
Q5.  Again for anchoring purposes please confirm type of anchor. We assume concrete expansion or epoxy anchors will be acceptable.
A5.  As far as anchoring NNSY can use keel blocks, cables & turnbuckles.
Q6.  When in use will the shelter ride on piers and straddle open water or will it be shore bound.
A6.  The shelter will not straddle open water, it will be totally on the pier.
Q7.  The faxed sketch appears to show two buildings nested over one another, with two pairs of rails.  Does the building need to pass over or under an existing structure?  It appears that the new building fits inside another building.
A7.  Shelter will be one section 60 ft long X 84 ft wide X 45 ft high.
Q8.  Are the 100 lb crane rail wheel and caster assembly fixed non-castering wheels, meant to only travel in a straight line?  Will uplift and kickout forces be taken by these wheels and transferred into the rails?  
A8.  Yes we only need to travel in a straight line, if we use 4 keel blocks one on each end and
anchor the shelter after moving each time, I think this will take care of any up lift problem.
Q9.  How many foot candles in the lighting system?
A9.  A lighting system is not needed, NNSY will install temporary lighting.
Q10.  How fixed is the delivery date of July 1, 2006?  We will meet the date if necessary but typically prefer 4 weeks to deliver.
A10.  The Project need date is July 17, 2006.
Q11. The description indicates the gable end manufactured in 5 ft wide vertical strips with grommets on all sides.  Do these panels need to fasten to one another or to the gable steelwork with rope? Do they want steel in the gable end walls? If so, does it need to be easily removable?

Statement of Work/Specifications

A.1 Introduction:
The U.S.Department of Commerce(DOC),National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA),Aircraft Operations Center (AOC),MacDill AFB,Florida, intends to exchange four T56-A-14 engines in “as is” condition with complete logbooks for one, 0.0 hour(all modules) Time Since Overhaul (TSO)T56-A-14 engine in “Ready for Installation”(RFI) condition with logbooks and two,overhauled to zero time PT6A-27 engines with logbooks.

A.2 Background:	
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operate two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. Four Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines power each WP-3D.  NOAA also operates a fleet of four DeHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine. Currently, NOAA has two spare, RFI T56-A-14 engines. With the projected acquisition of a third P-3C, NOAA anticipates the requirement for one additional spare,0.0 hour Time Since Overhaul(TSO),RFI T56-A-14 engine. Additionally, NOAA does not have any spare zero time engines for the fleet of Twin Otters. With the ever increasing amount of annual flight hours flown by these aircraft,it would be in NOAA’s best interest to have two spare,0.0 hour TSO PT6A-27 engines. The NOAA AOC in Tampa, Florida,manages these aircraft.

A.3 Scope:
Engines to be exchanged are as follows:

-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH9044 with 14,804.5 hrs Time Since New (TSN)

REVISED Statement of Work/Specifications
A.1 Introduction:
The U.S.DOC/NOAA,Aircraft Operations Center (AOC),MacDill AFB,Florida, intends to exchange four T56-A-14 engines in as is condition with complete logbooks for one T56-A-14 engine mounted in a Quick Engine Chnage(QEC)in Ready for Installation (RFI)condition with logbooks and two,overhauled to zero time PT6A-27 engines with logbooks.
A.2 Background:	
NOAA operates two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. Four Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines power each WP-3D. NOAA also operates a fleet of four DeHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine. Currently, NOAA has two spare, RFI T56-A-14 engines. With the projected acquisition of a third P-3C, NOAA anticipates the requirement for one additional spare RFI T56-A-14 engine. Additionally, NOAA does not have any spare zero time engines for the fleet of Twin Otters. With the ever increasing amount of annual flight hours flown by these aircraft,it would be in NOAA’s best interest to have two spare,0.0 hour TSO PT6A-27 engines. NOAA AOC in Tampa, Florida, manages these aircraft.
A.3 Scope:
Engines to be exchanged are as follows:
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH9044 with 14,804.5 hrs Time Since New (TSN)
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH8010 with 15,209.3 hrs TSN.
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH8000 with 16,429.0 hrs TSN.
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH4515 with 20,295.3 hrs TSN.
a.Engines are in as removed condition, but were in operable condition when removed from the aircraft.
b.All of the above engines are in a QEC,presently installed on wood frame transportation stands and wrapped. Engines have been in this state of storage since October of 2004.
c.This will be an outright exchange of physical assets agreed upon between the Government and prospective contractor. The value of the transaction is based solely on the intrinsic value of the assets being exchanged to both the Government and the prospective contractor.
