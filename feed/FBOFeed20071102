<CONTACT>Elisa Brown, (202) 267-3610
<DESC>The following are additional industry Questions and FAA Answers regarding the Air Traffic Organization (ATO-S) announcement posted on 9/12/2007.  The reference posting number is 6057.  Initial Q&A's were shared on 10/15/2007.  The reference posting number for the inital Q&A's is 6145. 1. The software must provide: Interactive visualizations; dynamic queries; drilldown capabilities; interactive reporting; user management; application management. In the context of "application" here, does the FAA use an J2EE Application Server today?  Yes Does the FAA have a required standard for application servers today? Yes, but standard is based upon disaster recovery and government security requirements and the system. Does the FAA have or use an Java applications or application servers today? Yes Is there any reason why the FAA would not consider Java for a future direction if not currently in use today? Java is used for development of applications, but this market survey is for existing software. 2. The software must be able to connect with existing FAA data stores such as Oracle 10g, Microsoft SQL Server, Access and Excel. The software must provide for ready access to data without extensive data registration requirements. Can you please share the percentage of FAA data in each of the 4 mentioned data stores? It would be beneficial that the software not be dependent on how much of one type of data. The term "without extensive data registration requirements" should suggest that the data source can be varied. A majority of the data is in Oracle (various versions). 5. The software must provide the ability to develop, store, retrieve and share analysis results and workflows in multiple formats such as PDF, MS Office standards and HTML. Please provide the FAA's definition of workflow here. Also, is there a workflow engine or system in place today? Workflow in this instance means the process/actions of analysis.  To see what was done so it can be done again or avoided.  7. The software must run on a PC with a Microsoft Windows XP Professional Operating System. For this mandatory feature, is XP required for the server or just the client machines?  The original intent was to allow the users to be able to do analysis on their individual machines, regardless of whether there is a server.  We did not restrict the software to a server nor solely on a single machine. If not required for the Server, which server platforms are acceptable? Windows, Unix, Linux, Solaris.  If a server is required the more platforms the system will work on the better.  Desirable features:  The FAA desires that the software, without modification, include the following features/capabilities but they are not minimum mandatory requirements: 1. The software should support the analysis of data in OLAP cubes such as Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services or SAS OLAP Server. Which version of Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services are being run today? Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services or SAS OLAP Server are examples of systems that use OLAP cubes, not the systems that we use.  Excel, Access, MySQL, and Oracle are other examples of software that can use OLAP cubes. These are "desirable" but not required.  How many cubes are in use?  That will depend upon the software. Are these cubes populated from SQL Server tables only? Or are they also built from star schemas within Oracle 10g? That will depend upon the software. In general, we are looking to understand the amount of OLAP available today vs. where the FAA wants to be in the future. Also, it would be great to understand any existing data warehouse, data marts and the overall ETL process that is in place today and any limitations currently existing within these areas. This scope is not part of the market survey.  We are looking for software that will assist in doing analysis of current data some of which is in the form of OLAP cubes. ETL, data warehouses, and star schemas are not a part of the current request. 2. The software should support the ability to integrate with SAS datasets either directly or through an OLE DB connection. Can you give more details on the content of these "SAS" datasets and how they are generated today? The intent is to allow for future systems to be incorporated.  Another division uses SAS and we would like to know if the software will be able to link to it or other systems that might be up for review of inclusion in datasets in the future.  We do not current have SAS datasets. These are "desirable" but not required. 3. The software should support the ability to link to SAS Software for integrating existing software routines and features. The SAS 9 provides a large collection of APIs that enables access to SAS Intelligence from J2EE, and MOM, which version of SAS do you currently have? The intent is to allow for future systems to be incorporated.  We do not current have SAS. These are "desirable" but not required.    4. The software should be able to integrate maps from ArcGIS Server into the visual analysis. Can you provide more details on the ArcGIS system and how it is used today? Also, what level of integration are you looking for? Any example would be very helpful here. The intent is to allow for future systems to be incorporated.  We do not current have ArcGIS Server. These are "desirable" but not required.   5. The software should allow for the extension of the software capabilities through additional programming languages such as Visual Basic. Is Visual Basic the only language you would like to use? Is Java acceptable? Is Java Script acceptable? Java, PERL, JavaScript, .NET, COBOL, Fortran, it really doesn't matter the language as long as it meets the basic government restrictions previously mentioned ("disaster recovery and government security requirements"). These are "desirable" but not required. Is Oracle used to hold your data warehouse and/or data marts? Do you use star schemas within Oracle today? Also, can you provide more details on what your SAS system is today along with any limitations you currently see within that system?  I'm sure one of the systems that we get data from is a warehouse and probably one or two are in star schemas.  The information comes from various sources depending upon the type of analysis. One of the statistical analysis systems used is Business Objects. 7. Is the FAA seeking the Server/Client implementation of the software? Or the standalone desktop implementation? Five people to use whichever best fits. Is five the total number of users for this solution? If not, what is the total number of users for this new analytical system?  Yes, five users. Could you please provide us some information about your current architecture domain: diagram or the link to the Web page? Five desktop computers linked via secured government architecture. Unfortunately we do not have the authority to share the government architecture, it would be a violation of FAA security policies.

<DESC>I1300070057 The National Park Service has a requirement for demolition, removal and replacement of an 18,000 gallon underground propane tank located at Cedar Pass Headquarters area in Badlands National Park. This propane tank services/supplies the Ben Reifel Visitor Center, Administration Building, Facilities Management, Law enforcement Rangers and resource Management.  The proposed project would include moving the system out of the housing area where numerous deficiencies have been identified (too close to building structures and inadequate capability of supply trucks safe access). The tank would be replaced with a larger above ground tank mounted to a concrete pad and fenced similar to the existing system utilized by the Park's concession operation.  This will ensure the standardization of the Parks propane systems and eliminate the potential for ground corrosion and failure of the system and allow the full use of its expected life cycle.  Project will completed by utilizing contracted personnel. A recent Condition Assessment by the NPS and A/E Firm resulted in finding the 18,000 tank is buried and ground moisture has corroded the main tank manifold. Distribution lines have been replaced. The magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  NAICS Code is 238990, P&S: Z249.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Office of Acquisitions, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, intends to negotiate a sole source, 9-month contract extension in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue operations of the Biological Testing Facility (BTF). The extension is required because of delays in the planned competitive follow-on acquisition. The planned extension will permit the BTF to continue to function while a competitive acquisition for these services is conducted.  The current requirement for a BTF is fulfilled through a contract with Bioqual Incorporated, under contract N01-HD-23338. The BTF performs a wide range of screens, assays, safety tests and analytical procedures for the evaluation of new drugs, formulations and delivery systems relevant to endocrine and anti-fertility activity of compounds that are provided by the Government and management of data obtained in support of the contraceptive and reproductive health development program of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).   AUTHORITY:  41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSRA 306.302-1(a) (2) (ii) A and B.   Planned clinical trials are dependent on the outcomes of tests performed at this facility.   If the testing facility is not available for testing new compounds planned clinical trials will be delayed.   As a result, substantial duplication of costs to the Government which are not expected to be recovered through competition would occur.   In addition, postponement of clinical trials will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7AO7, Bethesda, Maryland 20852.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Tina Robinson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-8778, Fax 301-480-4226, Email robinsti@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC), intends to procure the services of Origem Consultoria Ceintifica, Rua Nagib Izar 314, 03337-070 Sao Paulo (SP) Brazil to elucidate patterns of influenza and diarrhea from tropical regions of the world and implement user-friendly interfaces to inform end users about the causality of diarrhea disease. The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302. These services are set within the framework of an on-going Multinational Influenza Seasonality of Mortality Study (MISMS) study conducted by a team of epidemiologist from the FIC and National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The contractor has been involved in the study of spatio-temporal patterns of influenza and diarrhea with the FIC during the last year, resulting in the publication and submission of peer-reviewed articles and conferences abstract.  The contractor has been developing analytical tools for the Matlab platform that proved to be useful in several of the studies currently taking place and in fact to analyze data brought from different countries of the MISMS meetings

The contractor will analyze the datasets obtained now at Americas MISMS meeting, in addition to those that will be obtained at the Asia MISMS meeting.  These analyses will be based upon mortality data, virus surveillance date and vaccination coverage data as it relates to MISMS.  The description of such patterns will be performed in the highest possible resolution allowed by the datasets, both spatially and temporally.  The particularities of the influenza seasonal patterns in each geographic region will be described ? both in their stationary parameters (as captured by spectral estimation, which is mathematically related to Fourier decomposition analysis, whereby the variability of the time-series is described as a distribution of uncorrelated components of cycles) and in their non-stationary aspects ? as captured through the use of Wavelet analysis. The contractor will also investigate potential correlations between seasonal climate variations and mortality records based upon weekly Pneumonia and Influenza mortality reports.  Such investigations will be conducted by clustering the similar eco-climatic regions of each country and then exploring the climatic conditions that better explain both temporally and in amplitude their epidemiological patterns.  Monthly climatologies for the whole period and for each region will be obtained from the database originated by the interpolation of data from meteorological stations.
 
Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date (16 November 2007) of this notice.   The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NIDDK to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however; all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.     It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-08-031 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.     Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.    

If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Tina Robinson via email. All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Tina Robinson @ robinsti@mail.nih.gov or faxed (301) 480-4226.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call 301-402-8778 and verify that questions were received.  

PLEASE NOTE:   In order to receive an award from the NIDDK, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters (HQ), Office of Communications Planning, is planning to procure a membership to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Global Forum on Space Economics.  The OECD provides a unique forum whereby governments of up to approximately 30 democracies, other non-governmental organization (NGOs), and the private sector work together to address the economic, social and environmental challenges of globalization.	The OECD is widely recognized for the quality of its policy recommendations among members of States and the world community, and as a non-profit international organization, the OECD brings no commercial or political bias to its work.  In addition, the OECD is known for their expertise in addressing political, economic, technological and social issues in a multilateral framework, including expertise in the rules that can be applied to enhance the smooth functioning of markets. Membership will enable NASA to access expertise and capabilities through this forum that it would otherwise not be able to access.  In addition, it is anticipated that the successful development of this forum will help meet important U.S. policy objectives in the space sector. In 2005, the OECD completed a study and analysis of the development of the space infrastructure which was contained in “Space 2030: Tackling Society’s Challenges”.  This report made a number of recommendations on issues to be addressed to improve international legal and institutional frameworks for government space polices.	The recommendations from this report shall be used as the basis to address the key issues in the Global Forum on Space Economics. The OECD convenes the Global Forum on Space Economics.	The Global Forum consists of a series of six intergovernmental meetings over a three year period.  The purpose of the meetings is to provide an in-depth analysis of space issues, provide recommendations for improving the international legal and institutional frameworks, and provide recommendations regarding government space policies.  To establish a platform for international discussion and analysis on a whole range of key economic issues effecting the future development of space infrastructure and space-based applications, NASA is seeking information on the following topics: (1) space sector statistics; (2) benefits of space based applications; (3) economic indicators; (4) various economic and business models; (5) governance, including international cooperation; and (6) legal and regulatory frameworks. Other related topics may be identified and added, as needed.  After each meeting, the OECD will prepare and submit a detailed report. NASA Headquarters intends to solicit and negotiate sole source procurement for the above from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the contract will be for a base year with 3 one year option periods.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later that 12:30 p.m. local time on November 8, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.  An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note “B.” This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The authority is only one responsible source 10U.S.C.2304(c)(1).

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for additional test hardware and modification to an in-work piece of hardware to support the J2x engine program. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from KT Engineering of Huntsville for the following reason:   1)	The first item is the “PAR_SSME” test article.	It is a minor modification to test articles previously designed, fabricated and delivered by KT Engineering.	The effort and cost required to alter the existing designs to create an additional test article is small relative to that already invested in the existing test articles. Because KT Engineering’s has critical experience designing and fabricating the multiple similar pieces of hardware, sole sourcing this effort will result in significant savings of funds and time to the Government.  The PAR_SSME will be essentially the same as the ‘PAR3’ and ‘TIC3, nozzles which KT Engineering have previously designed and delivered.  The only difference is subtle, but important modifications on the interior contour of the test article. 2)	The second item is an additional piece of test support hardware, a “stain tube” (ST3).	ST3 is a minor modification to hardware previously designed, fabricated and delivered by KT Engineering.  The previously delivered support hardware is currently in test in the NTF and is performing well.  The effort and cost required to alter existing designs to create another piece of support hardware is small relative to that already invested in the existing support hardware. Because has critical KT Engineering’s experience designing and fabricating the existing hardware, sole sourcing this effort will result in significant savings of funds and time to the Government.   3)	The third item is modifications to the TIC4 fabrications drawings to reflect changes made by Mr. Ruf to the original specifications.    Mr. Ruf changed the specifications to improve the test articles function.  KT Engineering is currently under contract to design and build the TIC4.	Sole sourcing this effort will result in savings of funds and time to the Government.	   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 11/8/2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

<DESC>To All Potential Offerors on MDA's MIDAESS,

Lt General Trey Obering, MDA's Director has selected Terry Little as the interim MiDAESS Program Manager (PM).  He is leading the effort to establish the MiDAESS requirements and will continue until there is a permanent manager. Terry intends to communicate the progress of the MiDAESS acquisition to industry on approximately a bi-weekly basis.

Previous FBO announcements and communications have alluded to a draft RFP release in 2007. That is not going to happen. Our current schedule anticipates a release in January 2008. The draft RFP will describe our anticipated total requirements for all functional areas, but will not be fully detailed. There will be enough definition for potential offerors to have a picture of the total scope of the MiDAESS effort, however.  

The draft RFP will include the proposed NAICS codes  for the various areas as well as potential set asides for small and/or disadvantaged business.  Whatever rumors you may have already heard about these set-asides are not true; we have made no decisions about this - not even tentative ones.

We will provide, in the draft, proposed verbiage for Sections L and M as well as the Section H clauses. Past performance will be an important source selection factor.  We will also address Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI).  It is our intention to provide area RFPs with similar structures, CLINs and clauses.


This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     Interested offerors may registerat http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive email notification when information, solicitation and any amendments and future documents regarding this acquisition are issued and available for downloading.     MDA will not directly send offerors the solicitation or any amendments.     It is the interested offerors responsibility to periodically check this website for updates.

<DESC>1 Question:  Though the NAICS code has been established, type of contracting information is understandably not yet announced.  Are you waiting to make a decision on whether it will be a Full and Open competition vs. a Small Business Set-side based on the type and amount of responses you receive?

Answer:  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are not applicable to the United States Mint.  While the United States Mint does encourage and look for small business opportunities; this requirement shall not be a small business set aside.  

2.  Question:  Should you not receive a 100 percent match to all the identified business requirements, is it likely that a decision to move forward will be based on those that are closest to your total business requirements?

Answer:  Section 2.0 of the RFI addresses the capabilities in which the United States Mint seeks improvement.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine what Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) systems are available to address these areas and provide flexibility for other potential areas.  If no COTS system(s) currently exist then alternatives may be proposed. 

3. Question:  Would we be correct in assuming this is a totally ?unclassified? data storage and handling system requirement?  Yet it may require proper handling of information of a ?Sensitive? nature. 

Answer:  This requirement will contain For Official Use Only materials but will remain Unclassified.  

4. Question:  Will the client require 100 percent on-site development work?   Will they allow the development work to be done off-site?  Might they allow a mixture of both?   We understand the Requirements Development piece is more conducive to a fair amount of face-to-face contact.   

Answer:  The contractor shall be required to provide the services as outlined in any subsequent solicitation.  No limitations have been established related to the place of performance.  The offerors technical approach should specify their preference/approach for completing the requirement.  

5.  Question: I am trying to find out if there is an incumbent who has fulfilled these requirements in the past? If so, could you please provide any of the following information: Incumbent?s Name, Contract Number, Award/Expiration Date and Contract Value? 

Second, is there a time deadline for the Responses on November 8, 2007?

Answer:  This is a new requirement.  The deadline for responses is by Close-of-Business (COB) on November 8, 2007.  

 
6.  Question:  When we submit our response do we do it electronically to this email address?

Answer:  Yes.

7.  Question:  Are you looking at a single software product with some customizations and support software code written or are you willing to accept a consulting solution utilizing a combination of software products like say Oracle, Informatica, Java and Microstrategy? 

Answer:  The United States Mint desires a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system that can address the needs listed in section 2.0 of the RFI.  If such a system does not exist then other possibilities may be considered.  

8.  Question:  Would you post another RFP with detailed requirements at a later date? If so, when would that be? This would greatly help us understand the complexity involved here to propose a suitable solution.

Answer:  Based on the responses to the RFI, an RFP may be released at a later date.  It is impossible to determine if/when a future RFP could/will be posted until a determination can be made regarding the availability and capabilities of any available COTS system(s).

9.  Question:  Our COTS event management and records management products are geared toward security, police, fire, and rescue functions. Does the protection business organization include any of these functions?

Answer:  The United States Mint does have a Protection business unit and the RFI is intended to address their needs as well as the needs of other business units identified in section 1.0 of the RFI.

10.  Question:  We want to include a cover Letter with our submittal.   Can we submit it as a separate document, along with the electronic RFI Response, and it not be counted as part of the 10 page limit?

Answer:  No, the 10-page limit applies to all documents except brochures and published materials as stated in section 3.0 of the RFI.  

11.  Question:  Pertaining to the Department of the Treasury United States Mint's
Request for Information (No. USM-RFI-08-001) for a data and events tracking system, can you provide an estimate of the number of users that are expected to utilize the system?

Answer:  The number of users varies by business area.  It is anticipated that no individual business area will have more than a maximum of 200 users with no more than 50 simultaneous users. There are five (5) business areas.

 
12.  Question:  Is the U.S. Mint looking for responses that address both COTS solutions and COTS implementation and integration?

Answer:  The United States Mint is looking for a COTS system.  The United States Mint also understands that a certain amount of implementation and integration can be necessary in order ?stand up? the system for user operability.  The COTS system is not anticipated to require any more than minimal customization or tailoring.  

13.  Question:  First, how should we submit our response to the RFI (electronically or U.S. mail) and to whom should it be addressed? Secondly, when is it expected that the U.S. Mint will release an RFP?  

Answer:  The RFI responses should be submitted electronically to psb2@bpd.treas.gov.  No hard copies are required.  The RFI submission may be addressed to Damon Wamsley, however the RFI number (USM-RFI-08-001) is all that is necessary.  Please refer to Question 8 regarding the future release of an RFP.

14.  Question:  I am interested in helping with this job, will this be a sole source or comprised of a team of companies?

Answer:  The United States Mint will not know the direction of the possible RFP until the responses from the RFI are evaluated.  However, a sole source is not anticipated and teaming arrangements are neither encouraged nor discouraged.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification is to correct the number of test vehicles specified below.  The Government will be acquiring fifteen (15) test vehicles - nine (9) armored and six (6) unarmored, in lieu of ten (10) test vehicles.  All other informati on remains the same. The U.S. ARMY TACOM LCMC, Product Managers Office, Light Tactical Vehicles (PM LTV), Warren, MI, intends to solicit on a sole source basis with AM General Corporation (AMG) for ten (10) test vehicles - two (2) armored and three (3) unarmored for two config urations, and test support. The two configurations are a two (2) person vehicle (operationally similar to the M1113/M11 52 ) and a four (4) person vehicle (operationally similar to the M1151/M1165). The Government is interested in achieving improved vehicl e performance, payload protection and crew survivability, within the current Operational Requirements Document (ORD) Block II requirements. Desired characteristics may include: increased engine horsepower (potentially a new engine, power train), torq ue; o ther improved components such as transmissions, wheel/tire assembly, power steering pump, and brakes. There is no requirement to use the current HMMWV chassis and commonality is not required. Although standardizing improvements into the existing fle et of HMMWVs is desirable it is not required. Maximum leverage of the existing HMMWV support structure is encouraged. Test assets are required to be at the test site (Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG)) no later than 2 January 2008 and wil l be tested to the Block II requirements of the HMMWV ORD, dated 17 SEP 04. Vehicles will also be tested for occupant protection against mine blast, IED, and ballistic threats. The intent of this action is to demonstrate improvement above the current HMMWV  platform to bridge current capability gaps. This Synopsis/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements and delivery listed above, may give written notification to the Contra cting O fficer not later than 15 days from the date of this publication. If the test results of these vehicles are successful, the Government intends to pursue on a sole source basis the acquisition of future production vehicles.

<CONTACT>Bettye Lou Mahoney Contract Specialist 9169785570     bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is issuing this announcement to identify potential certified HUBZone and/or 8(a) Small Business concerns who would be interested in performing work for the Dike 5 Embankment project located approximately 5 miles northeast of Folsom, California in Placer County.  Place of performance will be at the US Bureau of Reclamation Central California Area Office at Folsom Dam. The principle components of the work include: constructing a temporary haul road from Dike 5 to the borrow area; constructing a temporary intersection with a traffic signal; constructing a temporary recreation trail detour through the Contractor Use Area; stripping to remove unsuitable material, topsoil, and riprap; excavating shell material to a 2H:1V slope; constructing toe drains, cleanouts, and a drain outfall; furnishing and placing filter material; placing shell fill and erosion protection material on the downstream face of the dam; furnishing and placing gravel surfacing on top of the dam; and constructing a permanent maintenance access road.  Limitations:  Haul routes are limited and may require extended travel time.  Folsom Dam is a secured facility.  Personnel and vehicles entering the compound will be required to comply with Reclamation security requirements.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard in dollars is $31.0. The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone and/or 8(a) small business concerns; however, all interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone and/or 8(a) concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  Interested parties should include the following information in their response:  (a) Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (i.e. HUBZone and/or 8(a)), and a point of contact.  (b) A copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone and/or 8(a) small business concern.  (c) A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor.  (d) Evidence of your Bonding capacity and (e) Evidence of your experience performing work similar in type and scope to include:  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers.  In addition, include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform required work.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice, by e-mail to bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov not later than the close of business on November 16, 2007.

Subject: COAST GUARD ESCORT/WORK VESSEL

Description: This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting market research in support of the potential acquisition of Heartland Waterways Vessels to support armed escorts, boarding operations, intercepts of suspect vessels, search and rescue, maritime environmental protection, and to service aids to navigation (AtoN) buoys and structures. Missions will be primarily conducted on the Western Rivers of the United States (Mississippi River System) in all weather conditions with seas up to 4 feet in height. The proposed vessel must be capable of operating approximately 1,500 hours per year (80% dedicated to the AtoN Mission) broken down as 10% at maximum speed, 50% at cruising speed, 40% at idle, and is expected to be in service for 25 years. The vessels must be highly maneuverable, have excellent sea-keeping properties and be durable enough to withstand buoy deck operations. (Note: Buoy deck operations capabilities do not necessarily have to be organic to the vessel.) In addition,  the vessel must be able to recover persons from the water and provide first responder medical assistance that includes working with a stokes litter in the interior of the vessel.  
Preliminary requirements for this prototype vessel include:
a.	Diesel propulsion, twin screw or equivalent, minimum top speed of 18 knots, and onboard electrical service, 
b.	Capable of sustaining underway operations for a minimum of 1500 hours per year.
c.	Maximum draft ?V 5 feet with a full deck load and with the capability of sustained shallow water operations (6') without harmful effects to vessel seals, bearings, intakes, etc. from sand, mud, seaweed, grasses, etc.

e.	Capable of supporting appropriate CG electronics package, including communications, navigation, contour surveying (multiple transducers; forward and aft, port and starboard), etc. The communications package will include secure communications (voice and data), and underway connectivity. Storage capabilities that meet CG security standards are also required to store secure communications associated gear and equipment.
f.	Capacity to support and stow a forward mounted crew served weapons system. i.e. M240B and other various small arms ?V approximately 36 cu ft.
g.	Capacity to support an installed infra-red camera system with a 30 pound pan/tilt remote head. 
h.	Ability to temporarily suspend operations and remain overnight at unimproved areas along the river bank. Method of quickly anchoring vessel in 15' of water and less with minimal swing circle. 
i.	Lighting to include remotely operated searchlights, task lighting, day-night interior lighting, and navigation lights.
j.	Substantial fittings for towing aft, alongside and for mooring.
k.	Stable in all operational conditions, one compartment damaged stability.  If fitted with barge to conduct AtoN operations, must be able to conduct other CG missions without the use of the barge.
l.	Sufficient fender system to protect the vessel during mission execution, especially servicing AtoN.
m.	Equipped with at least one multi-mission small boat capable of a minimum top speed of 20 knots and crew/passenger complement of 6-persons.
n.	Retractable mast/appendages to facilitate transiting under bridges with reduced clearance.
o.	The following are the minimum capability requirements for conducting the AtoN mission. (Note: This capability does not necessarily have to be organic to the vessel.)
(1)	Ability to transit service area, approximately 200 miles of the Lower Mississippi River, a minimum of 20 times/year  to service a minimum of 270 buoys per trip and recover approximately 100 errant buoys in shallow water in varying conditions of repair.   
(2)	Crane or boom with a 6000lbs working load limit (WLL), a capstan or winch capable of recovering/dragging standard CG river buoys and their moorings aboard (approximately 2,000 lbs) or equivalent buoy recovery system, and a chain stopper.

Description:

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting market research to determine the viability of contracting commercial vendors to perform vessel fleet maintenance and life cycle management on the USCG's fleet of eighteen (18) River Buoy Tenders (WLR) for the period 2010-2025, in whole or in part. This concept provides that the contractor shall provide in whole or in part; competent personnel who will execute engineering watch standing and maintenance duties and effect limited repairs to the engineering plant while the vessel is underway. The contractor shall also provide competent personnel to perform security duties for the vessel when it is in standby status at its homeport or in a maintenance status whether the vessel is dockside or drydocked.  While the U.S. Coast Guard will maintain total ownership of the vessel and its components, the contractor shall be responsible for the replacement of any main propulsion and/or auxiliary engineering system component to ensure that the vessel meets 95% operational availability. The U.S. Coast Guard will retain operational control, determine and prioritize assigned missions, and provide personnel for all other shipboard operations, including; piloting and navigation, mission execution, small boat operations, various mission related evolutions, and food services. Electronic navigation and communications equipment will be provided and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. The primary mission of these vessels is to maintain the aids to navigation system on approximately 6900 miles of navigable rivers and waterways in the Western Rivers of the United States averaging between 1350 and 1400 underway hours annually.

Commercial contractor costs to maintain fleet of 18 WLRs includes the following work performance:   

a.	Generally maintain the vessels to ABS Standards or to other written standards agreed upon by the U.S. Coast Guard.
b.	Provide competent personnel to:
(1)	 Execute engineering watchstanding duties while the vessel is underway.
(2)	Conduct routine and emergency unit, intermediate, and depot level maintenance of all engineering and hull systems, whether the vessel is inport or underway.
(3)	Perform general security services for the vessel whenever it?s in a standby status and moored at its homeport or in a maintenance status whether at dockside or drydocked.

http://www.fema.gov/plan/ffmm.shtm
 
Map Modernization is now in its final year and its goals are being realized.  The maps are the primary source of flood hazard information for the nation and essential tools for a much wider range of users including builders, developers, real estate agents, lenders, State and Local emergency management and land use planners, citizens and other Federal agencies.  Map Mod at its completion in 2010 will have provided: (1) a solid performance based project and program management infrastructure focused on results; (2) a premier flood data collection and dissemination platform; (3) a strong effective partnership with state, local and other federal governments; (4) digital flood hazard data and maps to 92% of the Nation's population; (5) new, updated or validated flood hazard data for 30% of the mapped stream miles; and (6) credible floodplain boundaries for 75% of mapped stream and coastal miles.
 
Subject to the availability of funding, the investments proposed for the flood risk mapping, analysis and planning (Flood Risk MAP) strategy from FY09 and beyond are based on the Draft Concept Paper at http://www.fema.gov/plan/ffmm.shtm  and also summarized below:
 
1.      Identify flood hazard data needs and establish a life-cycle approach to mapping updates, including areas along our Nation?s coasts and those protected by levees;
2.      Conduct informative watershed based flood risk assessments for all watersheds in the Nation opening the door for more effective risk communication, flood mitigation planning, and flood risk reduction performance tracking;
3.      Ensure Hazard Mitigation Plans (required by the Disaster Management Act of 2000 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004) are assessed and updated every five years; and
4.      Keep the Nation?s flood maps credible, enhance their quality, and maintain ease of data availability

The Risk Analysis Division seeks information on industry support capabilities, comments and suggestions for the acquisition approach, and other information that may help in the development of a flood risk mapping, analysis and planning strategy aimed at effectively delivering on the concepts described in the "Draft Concept Paper", available on FEMA?s Flood Hazard Mapping Website at: 

http://www.fema.gov/plan/ffmm.shtm
 
Map Modernization is now in its final year and its goals are being realized.  The maps are the primary source of flood hazard information for the nation and essential tools for a much wider range of users including builders, developers, real estate agents, lenders, State and Local emergency management and land use planners, citizens and other Federal agencies.  Map Mod at its completion in 2010 will have provided: (1) a solid performance based project and program management infrastructure focused on results; (2) a premier flood data collection and dissemination platform; (3) a strong effective partnership with state, local and other federal governments; (4) digital flood hazard data and maps to 92% of the Nation?s population; (5) new, updated or validated flood hazard data for 30% of the mapped stream miles; and (6) credible floodplain boundaries for 75% of mapped stream and coastal miles.
 
Subject to the availability of funding, the investments proposed for the flood risk mapping, analysis and planning (Flood Risk MAP) strategy from FY09 and beyond are based on the "Draft Concept Paper" at http://www.fema.gov/plan/ffmm.shtm  and also summarized below:
 
1.      Identify flood hazard data needs and establish a life-cycle approach to mapping updates, including areas along our Nation?s coasts and those protected by levees;
2.      Conduct informative watershed based flood risk assessments for all watersheds in the Nation opening the door for more effective risk communication, flood mitigation planning, and flood risk reduction performance tracking;
3.      Ensure Hazard Mitigation Plans (required by the Disaster Management Act of 2000 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004) are assessed and updated every five years; and
4.      Keep the Nation?s flood maps credible, enhance their quality, and maintain ease of data availability

 
Opportunity:
As FEMA advances the new Flood Risk MAP strategy, it plans to adapt the operational and contract to optimize the following:
1. Acceptance by stakeholders; 
2. Enabling Vision; 
3. Flexibility; 
4. Adaptability; 
5. Facilitating transition; 
6. Innovation/Problem solving.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MARKET SURVEY

TRANSPORTATION OF CARGO TO/FROM NORTHERN EUROPE TO/FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting a market survey on industry capabilities and potential sources for intertheater surface transportation of military cargo to/from Northern Europe to/from various destinations in Afghanistan via Central Asia.  There is no solicitation package at this time.  This market research is to solicit ideas and opinions from experts in the field pertaining to the potential follow-on competition and to develop the solicitation while determining the level of interested sources.   The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government will not make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties will be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and will be used to develop the requirement.

USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources that can provide reliable and secure time definite delivery, security, in-transit visibility (ITV) and end-to-end management of containerized and break-bulk military cargo from/to Northern Europe to/from various locations in Afghanistan, with the majority of cargo deliveries to Bagram and Kandahar airfields.  The military cargo may consist of CLASS I (food and water), CLASS II (general supplies), CLASS III (oils/lubricants), CLASS IV (construction materials), CLASS VI (AAFES supplies), CLASS VII (major end items), CLASS VIII (medical supplies), CLASS IX (repair parts), or CLASS X (non-military goods such as humanitarian supplies).  The current operating environment presents significant risk.  This includes strikes, border delays, accidents, and pilferage.  Within Afghanistan this also includes attacks and armed hijackings.  Shipments from/to the origin to/from the various destinations in the region could eventually amount to approximately 4,800 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) and 4,150 forty foot equivalent units (FEU) per year.  Approximately 85% are dry containers and 15% are refrigerated (reefers).  Additionally, break-bulk cargo could eventually reach approximately 20,000 STONs.  

USTRANSCOM encourages all interested companies to submit a detailed response that specifically outlines your company?s ability to meet these requirements:  
     
1.	Accept cargo at origin in Europe on behalf of the Government and deliver to the final destination in Afghanistan.  The Government requires transit times of between 30 to 45 days from acceptance at the origin to the various locations within Afghanistan. 
2.	Retrograde material back to Europe on return trip.  The Government requires transit times of between 30 and 45 days for retrograde cargo from various points in Afghanistan to Europe. 
3.	Establish and operate up to six container transload points in Afghanistan.
4.	Ensure cargo loss rate is less than 1% (to include losses due to pilferage, accident, spoilage, and attacks).
5.	Provide real-time ITV compatible with command and control applications on cargo location and provide full access to the shipper and other Government employees designated by the contracting officer.  
6.	Deliver cargo by the required delivery date (RDD) on a minimum of 90% of shipments.
7.	Provide direct delivery to forward operating bases, if required.
8.	Initiate process improvements and other value added services.  
9.	Provide end-to-end management with customized information management reports related to delivery time, delivery reliability, shipment volume and other criteria that characterize and provide performance-based views.  
10.	Handle substantial increases in shipments (surge requirements) as needed for wartime and other contingencies.  
11.	Provide security for cargo from origin to destination.

Market Survey:
USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment on this requirement to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (to include potential prime contractors, subcontractors, or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following:  

1.	Is your company capable of performing the services described and would you be interested in submitting a proposal for the services identified above?
2.	If not, why?  If so, briefly describe your capabilities.
3.	What are the recommended commercial practices from a contract perspective for these types of services?
4.	What are the methods/metrics the commercial industry uses for monitoring performance?
5.	What flexibility in a performance work statement must the respondent have in order to propose the most effective and economical transportation operation? 
6.	What data from the US Government would be required for a responsible response to develop a proposal to manage and operate inbound and outbound transportation requirements?
7.	Describe the risks associated with this effort.  How can the risks be mitigated?
8.	How the company would provide ITV, security, and process claims for lost, damaged or stolen freight.
9.	Description of company?s teaming and relationship management with sub-contractors along with your company?s understanding of the challenges and risks of operating successfully in the region.  
10.	Specific identification of any limits to company?s capabilities.  
11.	Your company?s experience in providing the services described above and its experience with an operation similar in size and scope to that described above.  Include the largest projects the company managed either as a prime or subcontractor including shipping volumes, total revenue, performance goal results, and other metrics with regards to pilferage, losses, % of RDD met, and how long the relationship lasted.  
12.	Your company?s recommended commercial pricing structure for the operation described above.  Break down pricing to normal delivery, retrograde of empties and retrograde of material out of Afghanistan separately.  What are the major cost drivers? 
13.	Recommended incentive provisions to motivate performance that will meet or exceed the goals of this effort (for example RDD, cargo loss metrics, ITV).  
14.	Are there any other concerns/comments or recommendations?


Send responses to william.henderson@ustranscom.mil and cindy.strout@ustranscom.mil no later than close of business on 30 NOV 07.  No phone or FAX responses will be accepted.  Please ensure ?USTRANSCOM CARGO MARKET SURVEY? is listed in the subject line of your responses.

The Contractor shall engineer, procure, fabricate, install, and functionally test lights, cameras, Radio Frequency Identification, infra-red lighting, and applicable hardware and software devices to meet the requirements of this SOW.  These technologies shall include intelligent video surveillance of the rail lines through the most critical areas of the National Capital Region (NCR) as designated by DHS.  Surveillance shall include detection of unwanted intruders and the identification and distinction between unauthorized and authorized personnel.  This specialized system shall be installed in the entire DC Rail corridor that includes the critical areas at the L?Enfant Plaza, the Virginia Avenue Tunnel, the Long Bridge, the DC side of the Anacostia Bridge, Union Station, and the First Avenue Tunnel providing a secure perimeter using intelligent video surveillance.  This system shall also provide automatic annunciation of alarm events, two-way public communications to the tunnel portals, temperature sensors within the tunnels, monitor train movement through the tunnels, and provide a digital log of all tunnel activity and alarm events.  The portal area under Union Station, where unauthorized personnel on the passenger platforms can get access to the First Street Tunnel, shall also be secured with the intelligent video system.  The Contractor shall complete installation and functionally testing of the state of the art, COTS equipment that will create a specific virtual boundary (fence) within the exposed stretch of rail line within the NCRRPP.  For the ASPP, the Contractor shall engineer, install, and functionally test state of the art, COTS equipment that will create a specific virtual boundary (fence) within the exposed stretch of rail line within the ASPP.  The equipment has been purchased for the ASPP but not installed.  The virtual fence boundaries shall include the rail tracks and sufficient lateral distance from the tracks to provide adequate areas of video monitoring (BZ).The virtual boundary (fence) shall consist of video camera technology integrated with intelligent vision interpretation software that will enable the system to detect moving objects, detect intruders crossing virtual boundaries, identify personnel loitering in the area, and identify unauthorized suspicious objects left behind or objects removed along the rail line. The system shall be able to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized personnel. Any detection noted above shall automatically trigger visual and audible alarms at designated monitoring stations.  Security personnel at the monitoring stations shall be able to see live streaming video and perform further remote investigation utilizing PTZ cameras. Fixed and PTZ Cameras shall be placed to provide complete coverage of the BZ.  The system shall be designed to allow around the clock monitoring of real-time streaming video, data and alarm information to the Police Communication Centers (PCC) for CSX and Amtrak in Jacksonville, FL for CSX and either New York or Philadelphia for Amtrak.  The system shall be fully encrypted and web based.  Other users, as defined by DHS, shall receive web access.  They shall include, but not be limited to the following:  Washington Metropolitan Police, US Capital Police, National Park Service Police, and other emergency response agencies.  The contractor must have experience in intelligent video security systems, infrared lighting, utilizing camera systems to detect friend or foe, objects left, and objects removed.  The contractor also must have experience, training, and certifications for working on the Amtrak and CSX owned rail lines and experience working with Rail Security requirements and safety personnel (flagman, etc.). Special consideration should be given to the possibility of frequent interruption due to active rail traffic and the requirement that high voltage electrical plates will be required to be scheduled and shut down individually for all work on the north side of Union Station, from Union Station to the New York Avenue overpass.  The Contractor shall be responsible to familiarize themselves with all requirements to work at or near rail tracks of a class-one railroad.  The Contractor shall be responsible to obtain any and all required certifications, insurance, and permissions to work on Amtrak and CSX rail property and shall strictly adhere to all Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations and specific Amtrak/CSX requirements.

The CSX Head End Structure has been built and all equipment is installed in this Head End.  An intrusion detection system capable of distinguishing authorized from unauthorized personnel is integrated in the overall system and programmed to trigger an alarm as soon as any unauthorized person approaches the structure. The Amtrak Head End Structure has not yet been built.  All Amtrak Head End Equipment shall be housed in an existing, secure Amtrak room with the same design intent as the CSX criteria above. Lighting, climate control, access controls and adequate square footage shall not be the responsibility of the Contractor. A separate fence is not required to be installed around the Amtrak-secured building, however, dedicated security cameras, motion sensors and an intrusion detection system capable of distinguishing authorized from unauthorized personnel shall be integrated into the overall system and programmed to trigger an alarm as soon as any unauthorized person approaches the structure.

The Contractor shall design, procure, fabricate, install and functionally test two virtual gates which will host the Train Entry Alert Security System (TEASS) in a location outside the virtual fence and as approved by DHS for the NCRRPP, two virtual gates in total.  The virtual gates shall be located, one each, at the south side of the Long Bridge and the north side of the Anacostia Bridge.  The Contractor shall provide either a covered structure or use an existing structure on the existing rail line and a TEASS (at each virtual gate) as approved by DHS.  The TEASS shall include all necessary sensors, equipment and software to (i) provide advance alerts of trains approaching the DC Rail Corridor including live streaming video of such approaching traffic, with complete 270 degree viewing of the train as it enters and passes through the gate (two sides and top) (ii) detect leaking HM/TIH material, (iii) test the feasibility of detecting radioactive materials on a passing train, and (iv) detect unauthorized personnel tampering with the system.  The structure shall be equipped with an air collection system connected to the Chemical Detection System (CDS) and a Radiation Detection System (RDS).  The Contractor shall provide a combination of fixed and PTZ cameras and adequate lighting so as to allow security personnel to remotely inspect the approaching traffic and if necessary request a speed reduction or even the stoppage of a particular train.  The virtual gate shall be secured utilizing a combination of video camera technology and motion sensors to detect intruders.  The Contractor shall provide an access control system capable of distinguishing between authorized and unauthorized personnel. Any detection noted above shall trigger visual and audible alarms at all monitoring stations.  Security personnel at the monitoring stations shall be able to see live streaming video and perform further remote investigation utilizing PTZ cameras. The Contractor shall provide a full T1 circuit to the internet at each gate to connect the virtual gate to the overall system.  

All cameras, sensors, detectors and radio frequency equipment shall be connected via wire, fiber or wireless (or a combination thereof as deemed most effective by the Contractor) to the head end.  Head end equipment shall include all video servers, intelligent video processors, centralized controls, programmable logic controllers, and firewall equipment for the encryption of video and data from the system.

The Contractor shall develop an Explosive Detection System pilot designed to detect explosives in high traffic areas such as are found in Union Station.  The objective of the pilot system will be to determine and test the feasibility of detecting explosives utilizing existing technology on large groups of people in high traffic areas of critical facilities as determined by DHS. The system shall be designed for a traffic flow minimum of three thousand people per hour.

For NCRRPP, The Contractor shall provide four chemical detection sensors to enhance the chemical detection capability provided at each of the virtual gates.  The four chemical sensors will be spaced along the approximate 5 miles of NCRRPP track.  In order to facilitate CDS integration and connectivity, the additional sensors will be identical to the chemical sensors approved for use in the Virtual Gates.  The sensors will be hard wired to processors in the Head End.  All equipment and specifications for the 4 additional sensors will be the same as those used for the virtual gate chemical sensors and other security technologies used in this contract. The chemical detection systems shall be designed to detect the same array of TIH, CWA and other Hazardous Materials as the virtual gates, and at levels well below threshold limits.

The Contractor must have the ability (training, certifications, insurance, personnel, subcontractors, etc.) to mobilize to the site within 30 days after contract award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 



Closing date and time for receipt of offers is November 19, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about November 20, 2007. Contact David W. Allen at David.W.Allen@uscg.mil or 252-335-6494 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

Description
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), is seeking companies or organizations interested in entering into a research and product development partnership. The motivation for this partnership is to support the U.S. wind industry?s development of more reliable and higher performing wind turbines for the land-based bulk power market in all wind classes. Additionally, this effort will seek technology solutions that would improve wind turbine capacity factor and firm wind generated electricity DOE is also seeking proposals for partnerships to support the development of ocean energy technology and will provide laboratory-based testing and engineering assistance. This effort is subject to congressional appropriations in fiscal year 2008 for an Ocean Energy Program. Interested parties should respond to this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) (2) announcement with a proposal by November 5th 2007. 

Background 
Reducing barriers to the expansion of wind and ocean energy is an important goal for the DOE Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program. One large wind turbine market barrier is rising costs driven by increasing commodities, exchange rates, and full production capacities. Technology improvements in reliability and performance are required to reduce the cost of, and thus the cost of energy from, wind energy systems. This effort hopes to expand on the Wind Program?s activities in these areas.

Modern ocean energy generators are still relatively immature technologies. Activities to further understand and develop these emerging energy technologies will allow for greater deployment and contribute to an improved scientific understanding.

Objective 
The objective of this CRADA solicitation is to make laboratory based resources available to companies or organizations interested in the further development of large wind turbine systems or components and investigation of ocean energy technologies. The CRADA targets research and development on components and systems that could be incorporated into commercially available land-based wind turbine architectures to improve industry market success in the near future and to accelerate deployment by increasing turbine capacity factors, firming wind generation and improving dispatchability. The program will not consider solicitations that focus development efforts on offshore or low wind speed technologies. In addressing ocean energy technologies the program hopes to support product improvement at a commercial or pre-commercial level. 

Partners selected for CRADAs will receive technical assistance and/or testing services from NREL/SNL. Although not defined specifically, possible areas of assistance include:
1) Testing of systems or components
2) Analysis of systems or structures
3) Development, modification, and/or use of analysis codes 
4) Data gathering on turbines or components
5) Aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and other analysis
6) Design or technical system review
7) Other technical support

Up to six awardees will be selected during the first phase of this CRADA. DOE will contribute testing, laboratory support, or other technical assistance in the total amount of $1,000,000. The resources committed by the company or organization must be equal to or greater than the value of the assistance provided by DOE. If assistance over the DOE funded amount is required, it will be provided by the requesting party as payment for services provided to NREL or SNL. The duration of each CRADA project is expected to be less than two years from the time of the award.

NREL is the nation?s primary laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research, development, and deployment and works closely with SNL. SNL?s primary renewable energy research has been focused on wind and PV technology development. Further information regarding the facilities and services provided by NREL?s National Wind Technology Center and SNL?s Wind Energy Technologies Program can be found at www.nrel.gov/wind/ and www.sandia.gov/wind/. 

The program will work with CRADA recipients to apply a program defined technology pathways analysis methodology to document the performance and other improvements that result from the collaborative effort.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Data Security 
DOE, NREL, and SNL respect the importance of corporate intellectual property and data security while balancing the need to document the benefits of public expenditures. Provisions relating to proprietary information and intellectual property are set forth in the CRADA.
