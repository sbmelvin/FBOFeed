Along with the CD-ROM a report shall be prepared containing  (a) Detailed description of their methods used in the manual determinations, (b) The criteria used to determine when manual determinations are needed, (c) Quality control methods, (d) Estimates of accuracy and the basis for these estimates, (f) Annual volume, and (g) Number of lawsuits filed last year for errors in flood zone determinations.  The firm selected must have applied for certification by the National Flood Determination Association.  The selected firms will deliver the data on CD-ROM in ASCII format.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to place an award to expand and evaluate the results of the current rural area law enforcement study initiative on a national level with Minot State University, 500 University Avenue West, Minot, North Dakota 58707.  The FLETC Procurement Division proposes to procure this requirement on a sole source basis with Minot State University in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  In FY03 a sole source contract was awarded to Minot State University to continue the Rural Area Law Enforcement Study in the Northern Plains States – North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming (Contract Number Tftc 03-01).  This action is an expansion of the current contract.  Minot State University has already established the methodology for the study and maintains all data previously gathered in this project.  It would be difficult if not impossible for another entity to continue with the program without the expertise developed by Minot State University and without access to the proprietary data maintained by the University.  Therefore, to compete this project and award to another contractor would cause an undue expense to the Government, the loss of valuable research already conducted, and the risk of not completing the project requirements in Fiscal Year 2003. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Coxen, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-720-7479, Fax 202-720-3987, Email ccoxen@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions as follows:
USDA/ARS SOLICITATION 09-3K06-04	
AMENDMENT ONE (1)

1. In listing the accommodation requirements, it says "2.January 20&24, 
2004: 780 rooms..."  Is the 24 a misprint that should read 22?  Could you 
please restate the number of rooms needed each night?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The Jan. 24 date is a typo and should reflect Jan. 22.

2. Will the 3 breakout rooms that will be used on January 20, 2004 that are 
to be set in a hollow square be used concurrently with the other 10 
breakout rooms, or will they be needed at separate times and could be 
reused (ie. hollow square arrangement for morning meetings, that could be reset for theater style in the afternoon)?

ANSWER:  Separate times.  In fact, we are likely not to use 10 breakout rooms on the 20th, only for the main part of the meeting 21-23.

3. In discussing concession requirements, it says, "4. Break/snack service 
for the afternoons of January 21 & 22, 2004 evening receptions."  Is it 
safe to assume that the PM breaks will be for 750-800 people like the AM 
break?  Also, are evening receptions planned and what date(s)?

ANSWER:  Yes afternoon will have same number as morning breaks.
Receptions: a welcoming reception with (perhaps) dessert and coffee Tuesday Jan. 20, informal receptions Jan 21 and 22 will entail cash bar service but no food.

4. How many hours of webcast per day is anticipated?

ANSWER:  We want to webcast all sessions, so roughly 8 hours

5. The RFQ calls for 10 video cameras.
  
   a. Because of the reference to WEB conference, are we correct in presuming that these would be digital video cameras?  ANSWER:   Yes

     b. Will all cameras be capturing in the same room, or will some of the break-out sessions be taped as well?   ANSWER:  We will use 1 camera per session (per room)

     c. How many simultaneous viewers (logins) are expected to view the live webcast? 
         ANSWER:  This is unknown, but could be significant (up to 5000).

     d. How many formats are required. Normally 2 formats are recommended--Windows Media and Real Networks.   ANSWER:   Yes

     e. How many bit-rates (speeds) would you like the content streamed at. Normally 56K for dial-up connections and at least one stream at a higher speed eg. 128K or higher for DSL is recommended. This should be determined through an analysis of the prospective viewers and the connection speeds available to them.  

ANSWER:  Most of our viewers will be on DSL as we are in government facilities.  We anticipate few, if any, dial in connections.  We would like our viewers, however, to have an option to indicate if they are on dial-up connections.

Additional info:   The Government IT Program Office commented that 56K seems a little high for dialup, 30K-40K would be more reasonable.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. 
This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SK2 Vasylik vasylykd@saipan.navy.mil
