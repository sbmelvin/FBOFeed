The purpose of this contract is to secure the services of an immunotoxicology expert to conduct exposure of the beryllium mouse model to different doses and different types of beryllium, and via different routes of administration (primarily skin versus lung). The outcome of the experiments will be measured by pathological quantification of lung granulomata and inflammation in animals sacrificed at 4 and 7 months. These outcomes will be determined by scientists in NIOSH. After validation of the animal model of CBD, dermal exposure will be evaluated as a possible route of sensitization. Based on an extensive literature search, we are confident that Terry Gordon, Ph.D. with the New York University School of Medicine is currently the only individual with a credible CBD mouse model, comprising three mouse strains with genetically engineered changes through "knock-in" of members of the HLA-DPBI gene family involved in CBD (one for each of the HLA-DPBI family members, designated: *0201, *0401 and *1701). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.

<p>The government will review any/all capabilities statements and and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Office of Market Research and Evaluation (OMRE) at NCI implements about 50 user-centered design research projects each year. Recently, OMRE has included eye tracking as one of the research methods used to conduct formative and evaluation research. With eye tracking, a participant sits in front of a monitor (that looks like a desktop computer) and is asked to review whatever images are projected on the screen (e.g., a website such as www.cancer.gov).  The eye tracking hardware has low-infrared (similar to sunlight) light systems built into it that reflects off of participants pupils back to the device; this allows the device software to translate that information into a visual tracking of where the participants eyes look on the screen even if they are not aware they are looking there. The eye tracking system tells us data about the design of a communication tool (website, brochure, web tool etc.) that cannot be derived any other way.
Value-added Research Functions
Currently, the user-centered design research performed at OMRE involves asking participants to look at designs and computer mock-ups and reporting back to us what sections, items, and components of the tools they believed to be important and relevant to their task at hand (e.g., in looking at www.cancer.gov homepage, participants might be asked where they first looked, why, what areas were most helpful to them, etc.).  The data collected, though valuable, are limited in that they are reflective of a self-report of what the participant remembers and perceives.  An eye tracker would allow us to triangulate the current research methods used in OMRE and provide richer, more quantifiable data that are not reliant on participants self-reports to aid the developers of web images and tools.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501(a)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply. 

 No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.  

Justification 

Tobii Technology is the only entity who provides an eye tracking hardware/software package capable of meeting all requirements needed.  No other vendor offers a product with all the key requirements or salient characteristics. 

Tobii Technology, founded in 2001 is an international leader in the field of eye tracking and eye control. The innovative technology development has revolutionized eye tracking by making it plug-and-play, fully automatic and easy to use and widely used within the scientific community and in commercial market research and usability industry. 

Tobii Technology main company focus is on eye tracking hardware and software that enables people with disabilities to interact with a computing device using only their eyes. There are no peripheral hardware requirements for communicating with the device: all that is needed are eyes. 

Utilizing this product will provide OMRE an objective insight into NCIs consumer attention and effectiveness of NCIs print advertising, TV commercials, product packaging, and online marketing. The concept of eye tracking technology in the marketing and usability industry, especially for NCI is to pre-test and analyze website data gain useful data and draw conclusions around what works or doesnt work the electronic communication media.

Each eye tracker session allows a large number of stimuli to be selected to help facilitate testing.  The stimuli can be presented to the viewer randomly, but all at the same time. Having the flexibility to use one or more stimuli could give great comparative data examining when a webpage is too busy and annoying or perfectly pleasing. Almost everything that OMRE staff members need to know about specific stimuli is included, which saves time and money on development.

We are requesting a sole source purchase from Tobii Technology, Inc. of their Tobii T60 Eyetracker system (primary tracking component), which includes the eyegaze-tracking device and camera built into the display as well as the accompanying Tobii Studio Enterprise software. Unlike Tobii, other like-products are physically intrusive to the participants where the device is either head-mounted or placed on a table directly in front of the participants (see links above for photos).  The Tobii equipment is built into the hardware and simply resembles a computer monitor.

Specifications of instrumentation needed:

	REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION
A.	Key Requirements  
1.	Eye tracking system/technology must be integrated with a 17 TFT display with resolution up to 1280x1024 pixels

2.	Must have an integrated user camera which is invisible to subjects.
3	Must allow head movement of at least 44 x 20 x 30 cm at 60cm from tracker.
4.	Must automatically optimize for bright pupil and dark pupil response subjects
5.	System must allow export of data to SPSS, Matlab
6.	Customize the content of the analysis by placing notes or areas of interest markings throughout the recorded analysis. This feature can be used to post information such as facial expressions, mouse clicks, etc. related to a given session

The Government reserves the right to answer or not answer any questions received before, during, or after the Industry Day event.  Non-proprietary questions and answers may be provided to all potential offerors at the Governments discretion.

Companies responding to this draft RFP should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned business, HUBZONE small business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.  Please inform us if your company intends to perform the work as the prime contractor or if you desire to subcontract with a prime contractor.  Ensure your response contains your company's name, street address, point of contact with phone number and email address, company web page URL.  Limit your responses to 25 slides and 50 double-spaced printed pages, and provide one hardcopy and one CD-ROM in Microsoft Office 2003 or earlier format.  If including proprietary information in the response, (1) ensure proprietary information is marked appropriately, (2) identify disposition instructions, and (3) indicate whether you require the Government to facilitate the execution of information exchange agreements with any contractors providing advisory and assistance services to the Government who may have access to this proprietary information.

After consideration of any comments received, PMA-263 will issue a final RFP no earlier than September 2008.  Industry will be given 60 days to respond.  Contract award is anticipated in the 2-3QFY09 timeframe.

Contract Type:
The anticipated contract type is Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF).  However, consideration will be given to the scope, predictability, variability, and risk associated with the work to be performed.  Contract incentives will be targeted to motivate specific contractor performance, which supports short- and long-term Warfighter objectives.  Industry is reminded that the Navy discourages exclusive teaming arrangements that inhibit competition (NAVAIR 5252.215-9505 Exclusive Teaming Arrangements that Inhibit Competition (NAVAIR) (Oct 2005) can be found at this website http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/clauses.cfm).  Additionally, the contract will require and incentivize the contractor to actively look for opportunities to engage small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and HUB zone businesses, along with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in performing work under the contract.

<a href="mailto:rodgers.jami@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a purchase order to the Manufactured Home Research Alliance (MHRA) ofNew York, NY using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the specific authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The purpose of this acquisition is to develop and evaluate guidelines for the administration and quality oversight of technical protocols used to produce and complete ENERGY STAR qualified modular homes that come from U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-certified manufacturing plants. Development of a set of guidelines for administering and overseeing the implementation of these protocols by stakeholders will enable builders of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes to cost effectively produce ENERGY STAR qualified modular homes by utilizing existing quality control guidelines and compliance procedures inherent to the factory-built environment. Under this order, MHRA will (1) draft and vet a set of initial guidelines; (2) establish a core of qualified and experienced builders, modular manufacturers, certifiers and raters for participation in a pilot field test; (3) periodically  report on the progress and results of the pilot; (4) conduct revisions to guidelines based on field test results; (5) vet revised guidelines; (6) develop a final set of guidelines after incorporating EPA's comments; and (7) publicize the availability of the final guidelines which includes writing articles for trade publications such as Modern Homes and giving presentations at modular industry events such as The Manufactured Housing Institute meetings.  NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. MHRA is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate guidelines for the administration and quality oversight of technical protocols used for building ENERGY STAR qualified modular homes.  MHRA's management and staff have detailed knowledge of the ENERGY STAR program and its technical guidelines for building and installing factory built homes, having applied to and been approved by ENERGY STAR as a national quality assurance provider for ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  MHRA also assisted in the development of manufacturing and quality control procedures that laid the groundwork for what became the guidelines used by all plants to construct ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  Thus MHRA has intimate knowledge of the technical and quality control processes that plants, builders and installers need to adhere to in order to build these homes.  In addition, MHRA is the research arm of the manufactured housing industry.  In this role, MHRA has detailed knowledge of how the manufactured and modular housing industries work and has the necessary contacts with manufactured and modular homebuilders, retailers, installers, industry trade associations, and state and local energy efficiency programs to combine the resources of these organizations to be more effective in jointly building, promoting, and installing ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured and modular homes as an opportunity to reduce energy consumption and improve air quality. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying EPA's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered. Reponses must be submitted in writing to Jami J. Rodgers, Contracting Officer, at rodgers.jami@epa.gov. A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR Subpart 2.101.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Uganda, is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing monitoring and evaluation services to the CSF.  The contractor will be contractually accountable to USAID and, through USAID, to the CSF and the participating donor agencies for successful operation of the CSF as outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding between the participating donors.  The CSF was created to eliminate a fragmented and poorly coordinated response to national HIV/AIDS and opharns and vulnerable children (OVC) efforts, and to strengthen partnerships with civil society and local governments. Cognizant of the above and various other concerns raised through a number of consultative sessions, the establishment of a streamlined funding mechanism was endorsed as the most appropriate way to fund civil society. This funding mechanism was conceptualized to address a number of issues including (i) resolving some of the concerns and problems expressed by civil society organizations (CSOs), government and donors (ii) providing a possible way for harmonizing GFATM funding support to CSOs for non-health and non-facility based interventions on HIV/AIDS, OVC, TB and Malaria, (iii) establishing linkages between the Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development (MGLSD) OVC and the donor support for  HIV/AIDS to CSOs and (iv) responding to the Global Task Team and Recommendations on Aid Effectiveness and Efficiency and the Paris Declaration on AID Effectiveness. In an effort to streamline the planned funding mechanisms as much as possible, there was further agreement on the establishment of one Civil Society Steering Committee (SC), and three operating units to support the implementation of the CSF - the Technical Management Agent (TMA), the Financial Management Agent (FMA) and the Monitoring and Evaluation Agent (ME) that would represent this partnership between the GOU, donor and civil society. USAID/Uganda anticipates issuing the RFP o/a June 27, 2008.

DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The mission of OCS is to work in partnership with states, communities, and other agencies to provide a range of human and economic development services and activities which ameliorate the causes and characteristics of poverty and otherwise assist persons in need.  The aim of these services and activities is to increase the capacity of individuals and families to become self-sufficient, to revitalize communities, and to build the stability and capacity of children, youth, and families so that they become able to create their own opportunities.  The mission of the Compassion Capital Fund (CCF), which is administered by OCS, is to increase the capacity of grassroots organizations and community coalitions to provide social services that support children, families, and communities.  CCF seeks to help faith-based and community organizations build their capacity  that is, increase their effectiveness, enhance their ability to provide social services to serve those most in need, expand their organizations, diversify their funding sources, and create collaborations to better serve low income individuals, families, and communities.  CCF currently administers three (3) grant programs: the Demonstration program, the Communities Empowering Youth (CEY) program, and the Targeted Capacity Building (mini-grant) program.  The CCF National Resource Center (NRC) has been established to provide program management and administrative support to the CCF Program Office.

	Provide assistance to the CCF Federal staff in support of the mission of CCF.
	Ensure that all Demonstration grantees, CEY grantees, and mini-grantees, as well as other organizations funded under CCF, have the resources, tools, and information needed to successfully accomplish the objectives of their awards.
	Ensure that Demonstration and CEY grantees provide technical assistance and training to faith-based and community organizations that is effective and appropriate for their needs and reflects sensitivity to their cultural environment.
	Ensure that Demonstration grantees improve their outreach to grassroots organizations historically not involved in similar initiatives and appropriately address the capacity building needs of such organizations. 
	Bring appropriate resources together to ensure that services that meet the needs of individuals, families, and communities most in need are improved and increased through the work of the organizations funded under CCF.
	Plan, organize, and manage two annual conferences for CCF grantees that pull together expert information about effective methods and strategies for carrying out their grant-funded activities and managing their Federal awards.
	Host, maintain, and expand the current CCF electronic clearinghouse, the CCF state-of-the-art websites, and the CCF grantee information database.  The current CCF grantee database is a comprehensive, web-based system that allows NRC and CCF program office staff a central location to store and track information related to grantees.  It allows the staff to find contact information, track consultations and contacts with grantees, see project information, descriptions, and funding levels, as well as upload and retrieve documents relevant to the grantee file.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for a General Construction Contractor (GC) to perform construction services for the "State Street Storefront Improvements Project" in Chicago, IL.  This procurement is entirely set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns in accordance with the Veterans Benefit Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f).

The Government has purchased one half block in the Central Business District (CBD) of the City of Chicago adjacent to the Mies van der Rohe designed Federal Center.  The storefronts of the State Street properties represent the most publicly faced portions of the Chicago expansion project in that they are busy retail stores in the heart of the CBD of Chicago.  The results of this construction project will cleanup the appearance of the storefronts and create a uniform look to the subject properties including storefront appearances and uniformed signage. This project includes some new storefronts, Panaflex panels with custom graphic pattern, new signage, new paint for first story building base and new lighting for existing windows and exiting stairwells. 

The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1 million to $5 million, with an expected project duration of less than 8 months. Work for this project is expected to begin in October 2008. A qualified contractor will be selected using a best-value source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 236220. Funds are currently not available for this acquisition.

Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to meet SDVOSB joint venture requirements as detailed in FAR 19.1403(c).  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on or about June 30, 2008. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov

A pre-proposal conference will be held on or about July 16, 2008 and notification to the Contract Specialist of proposed attendance will be required. We consider attendance at this conference important to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government.  Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in offers.  Additional details regarding the pre-proposal conference will be included in the RFP. The offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will also be included in the RFP. 

In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications at www.bpn.gov/orca and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov/.

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Helen DiMonte at (312) 353-1189

<DESC><p>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT<br />RESPONSES DUE: 23 JUNE 2008
<p>NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES: NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS INFORMATIONAL REQUEST</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Division of Consumer and Business Education (DCBE) is seeking sources and capabilities information in the planning, implementation, and marketing of a campaign dealing with advertising that would teach tweens (children between the ages of eight and twelve) and the adults in their lives to be more discerning consumers of information. The information below provides the background, essential elements and processes expected to be obtained through a future contract action in the pursuit of this endeavor.</p>
<p>If your firm is interested in participating in this effort, please submit a letter of interest to Edwin Franklin at: efranklin@ftc.gov by close of the business day on Monday, Jun 23, 2008. Please provide, in addition to your letter of interest, your firm's capabilities information, examples of successful past performance of a similar nature, information representing your firm's status under the Small Business Act, contract numbers if your firm currently holds a GSA Federal Supply Services contract for this type of service or any other federally-placed IDIQ contract for similar services, and any other information that might be useful to us in our planning process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advertising Literacy Campaign</p>
<p>Agency Overview</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them. The FTC maintains a website, www.ftc.gov, and a national toll-free telephone line (1-877-FTC-HELP) to respond to requests for information and accept consumer complaints.</p>
<p>As the nation's consumer protection agency, the FTC, through its Division of Advertising Practices, enforces truth-in-advertising laws, monitors and develops effective enforcement strategies for new advertising techniques and media, such as word-of-mouth marketing; monitors and reports on the advertising of food to children, including the impact of practices by food companies and the media on childhood obesity; and monitors and reports on industry practices regarding the marketing of violent movies, music, and electronic games to children.</p>
<p>Building on that expertise, the FTC, through its Division of Consumer and Business Education (DCBE), will develop an interactive campaign dealing with advertising that would teach tweens and the adults in their lives to be more discerning consumers of information. DCBE produces and disseminates objective, practical and plain language information to consumers, and has created a network of partners and intermediaries that includes public agencies at the federal, state and local levels, industry associations, and non-profit and advocacy organizations. The issues covered range from identity theft to online safety; green marketing to health claims; from telemarketing fraud to phishing - and include a soon-to-be launched website to explain the FTC to kids ages 10-14. The agency is a trusted brand for consumers and businesses, and has an excellent reputation among media outlets for the "news" of the day, as well for the "news people can use." In building out this particular campaign, the FTC is seeking guidance from a contractor with experience and expertise in reaching youngsters, as well as their parents and educators.</p>
<p>We recommend that interested parties review the FTC's consumer education materials for an understanding of the many issues the FTC manages. These sites are available at www.ftc.gov/bcp/consumer.shtm.</p>
<p>Interested parties also should review the following education campaign web sites and products for an appreciation of the latest initiatives and strategies implemented:</p>
<p>1. Consumer education video on how to avoid ID theft www.ftc.gov/idtheft<br />2. Interactive games and quizzes about Internet safety www.onguardonline.gov/quiz/index.html<br />3.

<p>Draft Campaign Overview</p>
<p>Advertising in America is a multi-billion dollar a year business. Truthful advertising provides consumers with the information they need to make better-informed purchasing decisions. It also gives companies an incentive to include features in their products that consumers want.</p>
<p>Children have tremendous spending power. For example, tweens spend about $51 billion annually, and their parents and family members spend an additional $170 billion on them. More than a third of parents with children between the ages of six and 11 in the household say that their children can significantly influence their purchasing decisions. By some estimates, American companies are spending $10-12 billion a year on advertising and marketing related to youth 2-18 (including ads targeted to adults for youth-related products and services). Recognizing this, advertisers and marketers have made children a focal point of advertising and marketing programs. For example, it has been estimated that, each year, the average American child between the ages of two and 11 sees 25,600 television commercials. About 22 percent of these ads are for food; 29 percent promote other TV programs; 8 percent are for games, toys, and hobbies; another 8 percent are for screen and audio entertainment; and 3 percent are for OTC medicines. Children as young as three recognize brand logos, with brand loyalty influence starting at age two. About 53 percent of tweens and 29 percent of teens report that they try to buy products that they've seen on TV or in the movies.</p>
<p>Given this phenomenon, the FTC proposes to develop an interactive campaign focused on advertising literacy. The campaign will educate children aged 8-12, and the adults in their lives, to be more discerning consumers of information. The FTC seeks to be neither pro- nor anti-advertising; rather, it wants to help kids better understand advertising. The goals of the campaign are to raise awareness of advertising and marketing messages; increase knowledge of how to skillfully read, analyze, and understand an advertisement; and demonstrate the benefits of being an informed consumer. The content of the campaign will be provided by the FTC, and be based upon the agency's experience with the subject matter, a public workshop to be held in 2008-2009, and the experiences of a network of partners.</p>
<p>Central to the campaign are some common-sense questions to help young people use critical thinking skills to become savvy consumers in today=s media-rich world:</p>
<p>1. Who is responsible for the ad? Kids should know that whoever is responsible for an ad will have a goal in mind, and that will influence the message in the ad. <br />2. What is the ad actually saying? This may be obvious in a traditional commercial or print ad, but can be less so in other forms of advertising, including games, product integration, or mobile marketing. The campaign will show kids how to decode and deconstruct ads, no matter what form they take, to find the basic message directed to them.<br />3. Why is the ad there? The campaign will ask kids to think about the call to action in the ad, and what the advertiser wants them to do.</p>
<p>Once exposed to those central messages, the target audience(s) should understand that ads are constructed to give them information and to persuade them to take some action - whether it=s doing something to help themselves or society, being more aware of an issue, buying a particular product, or something else.</p>
<p>While the focus of the campaign is on advertising and marketing - helping young people and their parents analyze advertising messages - the critical thinking skills that are central to the campaign, and that kids are learning in other contexts, will be helpful as they interact with all kinds of media throughout their lives.</p>
<p>The FTC will be seeking a contractor to provide a variety of services in support of this campaign to empower children and their parents to be more discerning consumers of information. The contractor shall demonstrate experience: 1) developing successful interactive, multi-media, web-based methods for communicating with young audiences; 2) developing curricula to deliver content to young people; 3) developing engaging, inviting and appropriate materials to deliver content to young people; and 4) successfully marketing this information to young people, whether through media or through developing partnerships with influential organizations (schools, libraries, other organizations). <br /><br />Target Audiences</p>
<p>The primary audience for this campaign is youngsters aged 8-12. The advertising industry itself talks of the buying power - and influence - of this cohort, and continues to find new ways to reach them, including viral marketing, advergaming, and other interactive media.</p>
<p>In addition, both research and observation tell us that children experience media differently than adults; in fact, children=s ability to comprehend and evaluate advertising messages has spurred a good deal of debate and research over the past 30 years. One conclusion by researchers is that children in different age groups have different information processing skills. Many categorize children aged 8-12 as "cued processors" - able to retrieve and use information, engaging critical thinking skills, but only when cued. Kids in this age group tend not to think critically and often fail to differentiate between central and peripheral content when learning new information. Our aim is to give them some tools they can use, and some cues on when to use them at a time when many of them are starting to have their own money, make independent purchasing decisions, and exert influence on the family=s buying decisions.</p>
<p>The secondary audience for this campaign includes parents and educators, primarily as a mechanism to reinforce the questions and concepts being delivered to the 8-12-year-old target audience. Both parents and teachers can help cue these children to apply critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>We are seeking parties that may be interested in assisting FTC in this proposed campaign that have experience reaching:<br />&bull; Children aged 8-12<br />&bull; Parents and other caregivers<br />&bull; Teachers and other educators</p>
<p>Areas of Interest</p>
<p>The FTC seeks firms that are interested in assisting the agency in the design, implementation and marketing of a campaign to promote advertising literacy, including the following:</p>
<p>1. Developing successful interactive, multimedia, web-based methods for communicating with young audiences: This will involve working with the FTC to create and implement an interactive website designed to engage youngsters in the target age group. Games and activities should illustrate the core concepts and key questions about understanding advertising. The site also will have sections with resources for parents and teachers to use and download. The construction of the interactive website is expected to occupy much of the first year of the campaign.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the tasks will include developing innovative tools to enhance the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently deliver the campaign message to both primary and secondary target audiences. Products to be created may include print materials, and CDs and DVDs suitable for use in schools and libraries.</p>
<p>2. Developing curricula to deliver content to young people: This will include creating engaging, creative, and interactive curricula that teach children 8-12 about advertising.</p>
<p>3. Developing engaging, inviting and appropriate materials to deliver content to young people: This will include developing engaging, creative, and useful materials to support the campaign messages about recognizing and decoding advertising. These materials might include print, audio, video, and other multimedia materials.</p>
<p>4. Success in marketing information to young people: This will include developing and carrying out a plan to market the campaign's resources to the target audience (including children aged 8-12, parents, and educators). A challenge of the campaign will be to cut through the clutter that children hear and see in the media everyday, developing messages that resonate with them, and finding ways to deliver the message in ways they will see, use, and learn from it. Using the same channels that advertisers and marketers use to communicate with kids may be more likely to be successful in reaching and resonating with the target audience, so the contractor shall consider those in developing and carrying out a marketing plan.</p>
<p><br />Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The Period of Performance for this campaign is initially expected to include a one-year base period with three one-year optional periods.</p>
<p>Budgetary Amount:</p>
<p>The FTC has budgeted about $2 million a year for this campaign.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory, intends to negotiate with Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp., Providence, RI, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b), for the purchase of renewal of special Abaqus License Configuration3 - 5 tokens (annual lease) for the period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009.

Brand Name Justification:  This requirement is for ABAQUS general purpose finite element software product offered by Dassault Systmes. The product is designed to provide robust solutions to highly nonlinear problems such as prediction of complex structural behavior under fire. The software allows for modeling of heat distribution in structure exposed to realistic fire and a nonlinear analysis of structural behavior as a result of heat propagation. Although there are other FEM software available in the market, the ABAQUS software seems to provide the best possible approach in using different types of finite elements for separate thermal and structural analyses and incorporating the thermal results in structural analysis and vice versa. 

Based on the recent market research, NIST believes that Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation is the only entity that can satisfy NISTs requirement for renewal of annual lease of Abaqus license tokens.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price type purchase order to Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation for this requirement.

Interested parties that are authorized by Dassault Systemes Simulia Corporation to sell renewal of the aforementioned Abaqus tokens software licenses may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. Such written responses will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

It should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Government, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NCI.  The NCI does not intend to award a cooperative agreement, grant, or contract on the basis of responses to this RFI or to otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information.  Based on the response to this RFI, the NCI may issue a solicitation at an undetermined time in the future or use the information to guide purchases of equipment, adaptation of specific methodologies or conduct specific methodologic research.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NCIs use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

This notice is for market research only.  The NCI is specifically interested in determining the types of organizations available in the marketplace that provide these technologies.  In particular, the NCI is seeking qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] which provide these technologies. Based on the responses received from this announcement, an acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  

Purpose: 

This Notice is a time-sensitive Request for Information (RFI) on state-of-the-science technology available for equipment to store specimens at ultra-low temperatures (-80C) that include automated specimen entry and retrieval.  This RFI will provide source information needed to summarize technologies that can be employed by the National Cancer Institute to evaluate advantages to making changes in the equipment currently used to store biospecimens at ultra cold temperatures.

Responses (no longer than 25 pages in MS Word or pdf format) may be submitted via e-mail to Mr. Vincent Barracchini, Contract Specialist (trainee) .   All responses must be received by  July 15, 2008 at  2:00 PM (Eastern prevailing time). 

Background: 

The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) stores approximately 12 million specimens in a variety of repository settings.  While specimens are stored at room temperature, +4C, -20C and liquid nitrogen vapor temperatures (>-150C), the majority of specimens are stored at ultra-cold temperatures -80C) in mechanical chest or upright freezers.  

As costs for facility space, energy supply and labor continue to increase, DCEG is interested in examining new technologies available for biospecimen storage at ultra-low temperatures that require less space, help to reduce energy and labor costs, while maintaining a safe environment for biospecimens and enhancing quality.  

The biospecimens stored by DCEG represent diverse sample and container types.  Some specimens represent collections that are over 30 years old, while a number represent specimens from collections introduced within the last five years.  The Government does not expect that all samples would be introduced into new storage equipment immediately, but more likely a plan would be implemented for the phasing in of the new equipment based on a variety of factors such as ease of introduction (which may be influenced by container and label status), anticipated sample usage, and the age of the existing equipment in which the specimens are stored. 






Information Requested: 

I.	General Information   contact information, including name, institution / organization, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address; website URL

II.	Equipment capabilities and facility requirements

Specifically, information is sought regarding equipment and approaches to:

	Specimen storage equipment that allows for automated specimen entry and withdrawal wherein the specimens are stored at -80C.  Please indicate if your equipment is still in the development phase or if you have units placed at client sites.  If you have placed units at client sites, indicate how many and how long they have been in place?

	Temperatures for equipment areas where specimens are staged and/or selected for input or withdrawal.  This should include a description of the length of time specimens would be required to be maintained at warmer temperatures during the staging, selection or cherry picking processes.

	The rate(s) at which specimens can be entered and withdrawn on a daily basis.

	Any restrictions with respect to the ability of the equipment to accommodate different vial types, and the requirements for adapting to various vial types.  It is unlikely that DCEG will transfer any existing specimens to new containers, but rather can plan for specimen storage in new container types as required by the storage equipment and containers used in liquid handling equipment in use in other aspects of our specimen handling protocols.  Please provide recommendations as to how the problem of different container types might be handled by your equipment.

	Discuss any suggestions you might have for transferring large numbers of specimen containers into any new, automated equipment.

	Label requirements for the vials (e.g., can the robotic equipment handle containers without printed labels, or are one or two-dimensional barcodes required?)

	Error rates in cherry picking or dropping specimens during the entry or withdrawal processes.  

	Discuss if there are any internal monitoring options included (such as a camera).

	Requirements facility features to support the equipment (ceiling requirements, foot prints for flooring, reinforced flooring)

	A description of cooling mechanisms used by the equipment (e.g., compressors for mechanical cooling or liquid nitrogen)

	Estimates of the power required by the units (include liquid nitrogen usage rates along with power consumption)

	The current capacity (e.g., number of specimens held in a specified vial type) and the ability to expand the storage capacity at a future date

	Ease with which equipment can be repaired and for which replacement parts can be obtained

	A description of the strategies for compartmentalization of specimens in case temperatures are exceeded in a region of the unit.

	Any emergency support functions that are included with the unit (e.g., temperature monitoring features)

	Feasibility or relocating equipment if the repository is moved

	A description of the warranty and service options that accompany the equipment



III.	Information Technology  software for inventory, tracking and environmental monitoring. 

Specifically, information is sought related to software and approaches for:

	Inventory management, tracking and interfacing with existing repository information management systems

	Environmental monitoring, alarm generation and integration with existing repository environmental monitoring systems

 Additional comments relevant to this RFI, and addressing issues that are not specifically mentioned above, are also encouraged.

      IV.           Determination of Commercial Item

Please provide evidence that your product is a commercial item that is customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes and (i) has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or (ii) has been offered for sale, lease, or lice to the general public.

<SUBJECT>A free standing bed/couch combination demonstrating flexibility that allows approximately twenty one to 30 days to sleep in comfort on an eleven inch mattress versus a sofa sleeper that has an four inch mattress.
<SOLNBR>F1W3Q48113AB07

<CONTACT>Jamesina M Stuppy, Contracting Specialist, Phone 907-552-3969, Fax 907-552-7496, Email jamesina.stuppy@elmendorf.af.mil
<DESC>We are looking for a company that can supply a free standing bed that allows the flexibility to allow a TDY member that stays with the North Star Inn approximately twenty one to 30 days to sleep in comfort on an eleven inch mattress versus a sofa sleeper that has an four inch mattress. Customer comfort is the number #1 priority within lodging. 

1. The required standards are as follows: The bed cabinet that houses the pivoting bed platform should be 70-7/8 x 20 deep x 85 high. The sofa is mounted at the face of that and is 25-3/8 high x 31-1/2 deep x 70 wide. When the bed is lowered, its projection into the room should not exceed 84-1/4 from the wall surface to the foot of the bed platform. The mattress should be a standard full size innerspring mattress measuring 54 wide x 75 long. The height of the top of the mattress from the floor should not be less than 22-1/2.

2. Panel Material and Finish Specifications.  All wallbed parts will be made of Grade A or B (minimum) Rotary Cut, Whole Piece Face Maple Veneer over particle board (MDF not allowed) finished with UV protective coating to match Nevamar WC5581 Blossom Cherry (in order to match other furniture in the room).  Edgeband is to be 1/8 thick on all edges that are routinely handled or touched by the user and must be radiused to a smooth curved profile.  All other edges to be edgebanded with 1/40 thick edgeband.  All edges must be edgebanded (even those unseen) for moisture content stability. 

3. Sofa Fabric and Style Specification, Sofa Fabric must be Robert Allen Crypton Fabric: Pattern  Sweetgrass, Color  Billiards.  Sofa should have rolled arms, plain (undivided) front skirt design, and 1-1/4 high legs.  Rolled arms to have upholstered, applied decorative panel on front face.  {see also structural sofa specifications below}

4. Testing Requirements, The Sofa Wallbed must have passed the GSA required testing (GSA WallBed Cycle Test #3FNE99-583 and Upholstered Furniture Test #FNAE-80-214A) by certified third party testing laboratory.

5.  Automatic Sofa Function, the seat deck and the back cushions of the sofa at the front of the unit should articulate downward into a storage position automatically as the bed platform is lowered for sleeping. The design should not require any action other than the user pulling forward and downward on one of the handles on the bed platform to accomplish the transformation of the unit from use as a sofa to use as a bed, and visa versa. No secondary releasing or latching is to be required for moving or securing the unit into either the sofa or bed position. After the transformation from sofa to bed, the sofa seat deck and back cushions should end in a safe, out-of-the-way storage position below the bed platform when the bed is down so that they will neither be damaged or cause anyone to trip on them when they are near the bed. Seat cushions should not have to be removed before lowering the bed.

6. Freestanding Requirement, the unit must be completely independent in the engineering of its structure, freestanding, and not require attachment to either the floor or the wall.

7.  The headboard is to pivot from a vertical, stored position to a minimum of a 7 degree angle from vertical (for increased user comfort) when the bed is lowered. This actuation of the headboard must be done without any loss of the 9-1/2 mattress thickness capacity. Headboard is to be a minimum of 18 high and 57 wide.

8.  The shelf will be a permanent shelf with minimum 4 depth and 58 width should be mounted above the headboard for storage of bedside items. This shelf is to be backed by a rail that comes up at least 2-3/8 above the top of the shelf. No part of mattress or other element of the bed storage can intrude on a depth of 5-1/2 space above the headboard (this space includes the shelf rail and the headboard thicknesses) because that would disturb any items placed on the shelf or hung on the wall above the headboard.

9. The automatic legs will have support legs for the bed platform to open automatically as the bed is lowered. These legs are to be activated by a mechanism or linkage that opens them to a 90 degree angle to the bed platform in a way that requires no future maintenance or adjustment to ensure the 90 degree opening position. These legs also serve as handles for lowering the bed platform. When the bed is in the up (stored) position, these handle-legs should be configured such that they cannot pinch the user.

10.  The bed cabinet sides are boxed out into 6-1/4 wide x 20 deep x 85 high piers for durable construction as well as improved aesthetics. Front and back elements of the piers are dadoed in place with added nailing blocks for additional strength.

11.  The sofa seat cushions must be reversible for doubled lifetime durability. Seat and back cushions should be constructed of medium density foam with Dacron batting and have a zipper along one edge. Sofa skirt to be covered with 1/2 thick foam. Sofa arms to be covered with 1 foam at the tops and insides of the arms with 1/2 foam at the front and outside faces of the arms. Top quality upholstery techniques to be used. Sofa seat deck support for cushions to be woven of a minimum of 2 wide ElasBel or equivalent type of webbing. Permalator or other metal grid-type deck supports not to be used. Webbing on seat deck to be covered with fabric.

12. All sofa components (arms, seat deck, back and seat cushions) are to be modular and so as to be dismantled easily (removal of easily accessed fasteners) if new upholstery is needed.

13. The sub-assembled elements of the unit to be fastened to each other with releasable fittings, such as bolts, screws, cam locks, etc. so that if any of these components becomes damaged, it can be replaced without major dismantling or discarding of larger assemblies.

14.  The European-style slats to be used as foundation for mattress allowing for thicker mattress capacity without loss of box-spring type support. These slats should be a minimum of 5/16 thick and should be set in two rows with a maximum of 5 spacing between slats.

15. Sofa seat deck must be able to pivot upward for maintenance access to mechanism and linkages underneath.

16. No Mattress Strap.Mattress must held in place inherently by the engineering of the overall bed platform and pivot system. The unit must not require a strap to hold the mattress in place since strap would cause difficulty in making the bed with linens.

17.  The Sofa arms are to be a minimum of 5-1/2 wide and onstructed with sufficient framing to withstand heavy sitting of users on the arm as well as standing on arm (i.e. for changing a ceiling light bulb).

18.  When bed is in down position, it should be set into the cabinet by a minimum of 12-1/2 to minimize extension of bed out into the room to the specification noted above.

19.  A Mirror should be recessed into the front of bed platform. This mirror should have a safety backing and be fully laminated to a 1/2 veneer core plywood backer for very high break resistance.

20.  The Sofa seat deck construction should be 2 x 3 and 2 x 4 solid lumber with veneer core plywood reinforcement plates glued in place.

21. No mechanism of the automatic sofa articulation feature is to be exposed or to be seen or touched by user.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of the Brand Name Component, Monaco System Transceivers, or Industry EQUIVALANTS, as described below, for multiple upcoming construction projects at Fort Drum, NY for 2008 through 2009.  No awards will be made from this Sources Sought Notice.  No solicitation will be available at this time.  However, responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used to determine an appropriate acquisition strategy for future acquisitions.<BR><BR>The New York District intends to solicit and award multiple construction projects for Fort Drum, NY for 2008 through 2009. The multiple construction projects will be solicited competitively under future separate solicitations. These projects will include a Brand Name Only component, as described below, unless the results of this sources sought notification indicates otherwise.  <BR><BR>This notification serves three purposes:  (1) to notify potential offerors of the Governments intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project for 2008 through 2009 and (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) notification of the Army's intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monaco System Transceiver is embedded in the multiple construction projects, which projects will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the projects requiring the Monaco System Transceiver is sole source if no sources are able to provide an equivalent system. In the event no equivalent equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.   A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an equivalent product is not submitted for consideration.  In such instances, the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring brand name components will be sole source if no sources are able to prove an equal product.  Supplies will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The multiple construction projects will include Brand Name only equipment for building fire alarm radio transceivers manufactured by Monaco Enterprises. These projects with their many state-of-the-art building components require reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire reporting system is the best compatible alternative to be used with the existing system.  Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  No other product has been found that can be considered interchangeable with or equal to the Monaco D-21 Enhance Central Radio Alarm System.  The only remote transceiver that will communicate with this make of base transceiver is the Monaco model BT-X series.  The required features of the BT-XF Fire Alarm Building Transceiver are as follows:<BR><BR>(1) Hardwire line or narrowband radio communication with any of the D-21 Fire Management System; <BR>(2) Narrowband radio is FCC certified for narrowband operation and meets the requirements of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Frequency Management; <BR>(3) Radio communication with the D-21; <BR>(4) Provides audio and fire alarm overrides for mass notification per UFC and NFPA; <BR>(5) Provides automatic and manual control of local or remote devices such as turning on pumps based on timed events, input from a fire alarm control panel, or manually activated from the D-21; <BR>(6) Provides eight relay driver outputs and four supervised zone inputs; <BR>(7) Eight onboard open-collector relay driver outputs can connect to the BT-XF relay board or to relay coils that remotely control equipment such as pump activation inputs, HVAC dampers, lighting, door openers, runway barriers, and gates. These outputs can also drive remote enunciator LEDs; <BR>(8) Four supervised fire zone inputs for connection to fire detection and monitoring devices located within 15 feet of the BT-XF; these are supervised for open (trouble), short (alarm), single-ground fault, and double-ground fault conditions; <BR>(9) Four zone LEDs (one for each zone) reflect the condition of the zones: trouble, alarm, or normal; <BR>(10) Status LEDs reflect the status of the BT-XF: general alarm, general trouble, system fault, in-communication, carrier detect, transmit, primary power, battery boost charge, and battery float charge; <BR>(11) Supports up to 31 zone expansion backplanes into which fire and audio expansion cards can be plugged; <BR>(12) Each zone expansion card provides four zone inputs and eight relay outputs for connection to local or remotely located devices; <BR>(13) Each expansion card has five LEDs: the PWR LED indicates power is being supplied to the card; the remaining four LEDs indicate the status of the four zone inputs; <BR>(14) Each BT-XF can support up to 252 zones and 504 relay outputs with 62 expansion cards installed; <BR>(15) One selectable RS-422/RS-485 port for communication with peripheral equipment or connection to a local access controller. An alternative use of this port is hardwire connection to multiple BT-XF units connected together for communication with the D-21; <BR>(16) Two full-duplex RS-232 ports used to program the BT-XF via connection to a laptop computer or for connection to peripheral equipment that does not have a RS-422 port/RS-485 port; <BR>(17) 115 or 230 Vac power monitored with automatic switchover to backup battery power that provides standby power; the number of hours depends on the battery <BR>Self test, stuck transmitter disconnect, reset, acknowledge, and battery reconnect switches; <BR>(18) Local audible alert; <BR>(19) Real-time clock and calendar; <BR>(20) 1/2 Mb of program memory; <BR>(21) 1/2 Mb of non-volatile data storage; <BR>(22) Fits in a variety of enclosures; the enclosure size depends upon how many expansion cards are needed; <BR>(23) Factory Mutual approved<BR><BR>Any vendor wishing to provide a system that is compatible with the existing Monaco system must provide a copy of its brochure and any other data by 14 calendar days from date of issue, NO LATER THAN 26 JUNE 2008, 4:00 PM EST, to Contract Specialist, Elizabeth A.

General Information<BR><BR>Northwest Region seeks to initiate the standardization process for Basic Prep Products for its 7 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alaska & Washington.  Standardization for this product line represents a previously standardized product line initiative for this Region. It expired 11/07.  This product line includes a full line of Basic Prep Products, as detailed in the Technical Criteria below, Usage Items. <BR><BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is 10/08.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.      Products & Performance Required <BR>The Northwest Region is seeking Basic Prep Products. The product category includes surgical clippers and blades, surgical prep trays (both wet and dry configurations), and the following skin prep agents: Chlorhexidine Gluconate, <BR>Povidone Iodine Scrub, Povidone Iodine Solution.<BR>Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $61,501  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>BLADE CLIPPER SURG<BR>CLIPPER SURGICAL DISPOSABLE SINGLE USE<BR>SWABSTICK PREP PVP IODINE<BR>TRAY,PREP,EXIDINE-4 PREOP<BR>SCRUB SKIN TRAY/6 FM<BR>TRAY SKIN PREP DRY W/SPONGE<BR>BLADE FOR 3M SURGICAL CLIPPER DISPOSABLE<BR>DRY SKIN SCRUB TRAY<BR>TRAY SKIN PREP PVP-1 W/110 ML<BR>ASSEMBLY BLADE CLIPPER DISP<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR><BR>C.      Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@us.army.mil. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.       Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.   Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company           criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.  Vendor is required to provide a full range of Prepping Products.  At a minimum, vendors must carry surgical clippers and blades, surgical prep trays (both wet and dry configurations), and the following skin prep agents: Chlorhexidine Gluconate, Povidone Iodine Scrub, and Povidone Iodine Solution. Note: A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>a.  Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (please provide DAPA number).  <BR>b.  Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>c.  Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. <BR><BR>3.  The Vendor has a delivery network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet regional demand history in a timely manner.  <BR><BR>4.  Vendor representation must be sufficient to provide product implementation services and customer servicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please answer Yes/ No and provide contact information (name, address, phone, email) <BR>for your representative(s). <BR><BR>5.  Your company must provide staff training for this product line.  Please state how your company will meet this requirement. <BR><BR>6.  Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If your company has not had any of the above, so state.<BR><BR>7.  Provide the following information for your prep agents and prep trays: shelf-life, storage requirements and any restricted use for any specific surgical procedures/skin condition and/or specific age group. (Short shelf life and or <BR>special storage and handling requirements are undesirable and may therefore make certain products unacceptable).<BR><BR>8.  Due to the large number of personnel in training status in our facilities, we require clear and explicit instructions regarding safe use of prep agent products as included on product packaging to include recommended coverage rate, (e.g. x inches by x inches per ml) of product.  Please provide a copy of instructions for use included on your companys product packages for the following types of prep agents:  Chlorhexidine Gluconate, Povidone Iodine Scrub, and Povidone Iodine Solution.<BR><BR>9.  Clippers must be lightweight, cordless, rechargeable, and be capable of clipping wet or dry hair.  Please provide information on how your companys products meet the requirements listed.<BR><BR>10.  Clippers must be water resistant (immersible in disinfectant solution for cleaning purposes).  Please provide information on how your companys product meets this requirement.  <BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  the CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a clinical, patient care setting. <BR> <BR>1.	The following procedures will apply. <BR><BR>a.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. (DO NOT SEND UNTIL REQUESTED)<BR>b.	Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c.	All email communications between vendors and the region concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d.	Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e.	Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.  <BR><BR>2.	The samples to be provided are as follows: <BR><BR>Clippers: <BR><BR>Clipper:  5 clipper handles<BR>General Purpose Blades:  20 each<BR>Blades for the perineal area:  10 each<BR><BR>Prep Trays:<BR><BR>a. Prep Tray (Dry)  (10 each)<BR>b. Prep Tray (Wet) that includes a container (preferably 2-4 oz size) of 4 % Chlorhexidine Gluconate  (5 Each)<BR>c. Prep Tray (Wet) that includes containers (preferably 2-4 oz size) of 7.5% Povidone Iodine scrub and 10% Povidone Idodine solution.  (5 each)<BR><BR>Skin Prep Agents:<BR><BR>Solutions:<BR>Betadine Scrub 7.5%:  1 Gallon Quantity: 1<BR>Betadine Solution 10%:  1 Gallon<BR>Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4%:  1 Gallon Quantity:  1 <BR><BR>3.	The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluation will take place on at least 5 patients in a clinical patient care setting.  <BR><BR>4.	The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.  .<BR><BR>5.	The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  All criteria will be evaluated on at least 5 patients in a patient care setting, in order to evaluate each criterion:    <BR><BR>Clipper Products:  <BR>1.  Clipper blade package is easy to open (package has edge which can be grabbed and opened quickly).<BR>     a.   All tasks for surgical preparation must be performed as fast and efficiently as possible to minimize the time the patient spends in the operating room.  Complications increase as surgical and anesthesia time increases. <BR>     b.   While opening the blade package the evaluator will assess any difficulties with grabbing the package edge, and whether the product opens quickly without tearing.<BR><BR>2. Blades are easily applied/removed from clipper handle.<BR>     a.   Blades must snap or slide on/off in quick manner to minimize time spent removing hair from the surgical site.<BR>     b.  Evaluator will assess any difficulties with getting the blade on or off the clipper handle in a smooth motion without having to repeat the motion, thus wasting time.<BR><BR>3.	Blades remove wet and/or dry body hair, pubic hair or head hair without harm to skin   <BR>a.  Traumatized skin can provide an opportunity for colonization of microorganisms at the surgical site, increasing the risk of post-operative infection.  <BR>b.  Evaluator will assess the skin after clipping for nicks/cuts. <BR><BR>Basic Skin Prep Agents:    <BR>1.  Use of the product following manufacturer recommended prep and dry times facilitated an efficient surgical site prep time.<BR>a.   Each manufacturer is required, in their user instructions, to recommend prep contact and dry times for their products.  These times maximize product efficacy.  If application, contact and or dry time in a clinical setting is too long, time spent in the OR can increase leading to increased risk of surgical and anesthetic complications.<BR>b.	Evaluator will assess the whether actual prep contact and dry times for the products allow for efficient surgical site prep time. <BR><BR>2.  Consistency and odor of product is clinically acceptable.<BR>a.   Patients undergoing surgery can be sensitive to odors increasing their potential for nausea.  Consistency must be considered because a too thick product will not spread effectively on the patients skin and a too thin product can drip and pool underneath the patient and increase the risk of a chemical burn.<BR>b.   Evaluator will assess odor (not strong or noxious smell) and that product does not run or drip during application to surgical site.<BR><BR>3.  Skin is without adverse effects after using product.<BR>     a.   Hypersensitivity to prepping products may cause adverse skin outcomes (rashes, redness/irritation)<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess skin for redness/irritation following use of product on patients skin.  <BR><BR>4.  Use of the product allows for easy differentiation between prepped and unprepped skin.<BR>     a.   Some product tints are difficult to visually distinguish on the skin of people of all ethnicities.  Draping over unprepped skin would increase the risk of postoperative infection from skin flora contaminating the surgical field.<BR>     b.   Evaluator will assess skin following prep to determine whether prepped and unprepped skin is clearly delineated prior to draping the patient.  <BR><BR>5.  Use of the product does not obscure pre-operative surgical markings.  <BR><BR>     a.  Marking of the surgical site identifies the correct operative site.  If the prepping product obscures the pre-op marking the potential for a wrong site surgery is increased.<BR>     b. Evaluator will assess surgical site to ensure that pre-op surgical markings are still visible following the prepping procedure.  <BR><BR>6.  Use of the product facilitates surgical drape adhesion throughout the operative period<BR>      a. Products must dry quickly and completely so that drapes adhere to the prepped surgical site.  Inadvertent shifting of drapes during the surgical procedure could result in contamination of the surgical field.  <BR>b.   Evaluator will assess whether drapes shift during the surgical procedure<BR><BR>Dry Skin Prep Trays:  <BR>1.  The prep package opens quickly with minimal risk of contaminating contents (to prevent breaks in aseptic technique).<BR>     a.   All tasks for surgical preparation must be performed as fast and efficiently as possible while adhering to strict aseptic technique. (Risk of a post-op surgical infection increases with breaks in aseptic technique.  Surgical complications also increase as surgical and anesthesia time increases.) <BR>b.  While opening the prep tray, the evaluator will assess any difficulties with grabbing the package edge, and whether the product opens evenly without tearing, and the package can be quickly opened without contaminating sterile contents.  <BR><BR>2.	Contents of the prep tray allow the users to follow the facility prepping SOP without adding items other than the scrub and solution used on the patient.<BR>a.   The facility SOP serves as the operational guideline for performing a procedure correctly.  If not all items required to follow protocol are available, efficiency is impacted potentially lengthening the surgical procedure.<BR>b.  Evaluator will observe whether other items (other than the scrub and solution) had to be added to the prep tray to be compliant with the facility prepping SOP.  <BR><BR>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.1 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines. (3) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only.  This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this information.  No reimbursement will be made associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up requests.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  All responses must be in written format; no telephone calls will be accepted.
This sources sought synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted to determine potential sources capable of providing Sailors and Marines with Tactical Casualty Combat Care with Live Tissue Training (TCCC with LTT).  The applicable NAICS is 541711.
In preparation for a future procurement, the Regional Contracting Office, Northeast, Marine Corps Base (MCB), Quantico, VA  22134 is seeking the most effective and cost efficient manner possible to provide Sailors and Marines with LTT.  The government will examine two (2) possible Courses of Action (COA).  The first COA will examine contracting out the entirety of the TCCC with LTT for all contractors who provide proposals on the open contract. The government will evaluate curriculum cost data and estimates received for a complete TCCC with LTT course that includes classroom instruction and live tissue lab days.  The instruction period should be approximately five days in length, three classroom days and two live tissue lab days.  The first three days will teach the skills that are listed in the attached proposed requirement and the lab portion will give the students a chance to practice the skills that were taught in the previous three days.  The duration of this course should be five days; however, the contractor shall provide rationale for exceeding this objective. The second COA will examine military provision of the classroom portion of TCCC with LTT and contractor provision of the LTT laboratory portion.  The government will examine curriculum cost data and estimates received for live tissue lab days exclusively.  As indicated previously, the government anticipates two live tissue lab days.  The Marine Corps assumes that it will require TCCC with LTT training for a total of 1800 students annually in the vicinity of Field Medical Training Battalions East and West for the next five years.  Curriculum must comply with the SOW and its enclosures and instructions included in the attachment.  
In response to this sources sought synopsis a capability statement must be submitted that demonstrates extensive experience with, and ability to develop and perform the course described herein.  Responses must contain the following information:  (1) a one (1) page corporate summary including the contractors web site; (2) an extensive summary of the contractors relevant current and prior work experience to include resumes of trainers that exhibit a minimum of one year prior combat medical experience; (3) cost data responding to each above mentioned COA and curriculum requirements in the attachment; (4) description of any potential conflicts of interest the contractor may have in performing the work; (5) a brief description of the contractors qualify control processes for deliverables; (6) past performance information, to include contact information for similar work; and (7) a listing of any current negotiated GSA schedules, Government contracts, or commercial pricing schedules.
The Government will conduct market analysis by reviewing each contractors capability statement.  Any contractor should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the contractors qualifications to perform.
Government professional services contractor(s) may have access to data submitted in response to this synopsis.  Proprietary and confidential information will not be accepted.  The Government believes that standard specifications and capabilities should sufficient to respond.  If a contractor believes that their response must include proprietary or confidential information in order to be considered, their response must be properly annotated.
Questions regarding this RFI may be submitted by 4:00pm EST on 18 June 2008.  All questions must be in writing and addressed to:
Kelly.kowalczyk@usmc.mil

All packages must be received no later than 3:00 p.m. on 10 July 2008.  Responses received after this deadline may not be considered.All packages shall be submitted to the below address.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Progress Software Corporation,14 Oak Park Drive, Bedford, MA 017301485,to provide Progress Softwares ObjectStore database engine, to integrate existing and planned components of NIST, METs Enterprise Information Systems-CIMS. MEP has developed CIMS using the Java Enterprise Edition standard employing an object-oriented database management system and application development techniques. The system uses MEPs application server of choice BEA Systems Weblogic Server.  This approach required making the application server totally independent from the database, which resulted in the need for an in-memory persistent cache. Only ObjectStore provides both complete integration with Weblogic Application Server and support for in-memory persistent caching. Without ObjectStore, MEP will not be able to maintain CIMS. This is priority software only available with Progress Software.  
A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about June 23, 2008, and the period of performance shall be July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009.
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the Henry L. Stimson Center, a non-profit organization, on a sole source basis, to analyze medical and public health trends in after-action reports.  The period of performance will be from date of award through September 30, 2008.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

The Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO) and The Emergency Care Coorination Center (ECCC) has the responsibility of identifying high-priority gaps in mass casualty care capabilities.  One of the most important steps of the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) is the development of the after-action report (AAR) which serves as the authoritative statement of problems encountered, lessons learned, and corrective actions that should be undertaken in the future.  The most comprehensive repositories of AARs, is the secure Lessons Learned Information Sharing (www.LLIS.gov) system, which currently holds over six hundred AARs. The AARs derived from incidents and exercises constitute an important body of knowledge about emergency preparedness and response problems, lessons learned, and recommended corrective actions.  Unfortunately, there have been no known attempts to examine trends across these AARs.  Since November 2002, the Henry L. Stimson Center has provided research support to LLIS.gov, the national network of Lessons Learned and Best Practices for emergency response and homeland security professionals. LLIS.gov is a secure network designed to facilitate efforts to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism across all disciplines and communities throughout the United States.  

The Henry L. Stimson Center is considered the only source because due to its experience and expertise is the only organization that can provide the services necessary in the time frame given.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements should be submitted by 5 pm June 27, 2008 to keith.austin@psc.hhs.gov.

JUSTIFICATION:

The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Limited Source Basis to provide Maintenance for Centracom Integrated Command and Control (IC2) Console System.   The Randolph AFB Personal Wireless Communications Systems (PWCS) Office requires continued maintenance warranty coverage on Centracom System Equipment and Software  used to route emergency 9-1-1 telephone calls, administrative telephone calls, voice radio calls via specialized network equipment.  Purchase of the maintenance is required to maintain telephone and radio call distribution, routing and service.  This system allows the base populace to report emergency situations and conduct administrative telephone calls with the Base Fire Department Alarm Center and Security Forces Law Enforcement Desk.   Motorola/PlantCML meets the need to be available within four (4) hours in the event on-site technical support is required.  The system was purchased approximately 2 years ago from Motorola, Inc., Federal Markets Division in partnership with PlantCML, who originally manufactured this system.  Maintenance of proprietary equipment by another vendor of the current system is cost prohibitive and is not in the best interest of the Government.  As the prime manufacturer, Motorola, Inc holds proprietary data rights to the equipment and software and has no authorized distributors or service providers to provide depot maintenance.  Any warranty and/or maintenance performed on existing Motorola equipment must be performed by Motorola trained and certified personnel due to proprietary intellectual properties, proprietary data and copyrights to equipment held by Motorola.  Therefore, Motorola is deemed to be the only source that can satisfy agency requirements.  



Schedule of Supplies/Services

The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, transportation, supplies, equipment, and other items necessary to perform maintenance for the following time period:

Performance Period:  12 Months from date of Contract Award

																								Extended
ITEM    					Quantity  Unit		Unit Price	Amount

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has a requirement for lead Background Investigators In-House. This is a combine synopsis/solicitation requirement.
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, OPM regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the In-House Team Lead Special Investigators, hereinafter referred to as contractors.

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired Federal investigators who have at least three (3) years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

The Personnel Security Branch (PSB) is currently organized into four (4) team sections.  Applicant Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF special agents, industry operations investigators, and other ATF personnel.  Contractor Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF contractors, student interns, volunteers, summer/winter hires, and other non-ATF personnel.  Employee Team: responsible for conducting periodic reinvestigations on current ATF employees.  Investigations Team: responsible for organizing assignments and reviewing background investigative leads sent to ATF Field Special Investigators.  In addition, the Investigations Team provides guidance and assistance to Special Investigators in the field; they also serve as the authority for investigative coverage requirements.

Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Such tasks include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, reviewing and/or drafting policy and procedures (subject to final approval by ATF), generating status and statistical reports, evaluating and assessing priorities and procedures, and implementing necessary change, disseminating information to team members, team training, coordinating with team assistants, attending team/branch meetings when required, and working on special projects as directed by their Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief. 

Contractors are responsible for organizing their team and maintaining communication with their team and PSB staff and management.  They must have the ability to assess the needs of their team and effectively set goals and priorities to ensure compliance with mandated guidelines and ATF hiring goals.  Contractors will correspond with the COTR and/or Branch Chief prior to initiating new policies/procedures or shifting team priorities.  All policies are subject to final review by ATF.  Contractors should be able to review current standards, make recommendations, and provide written direction.  They are responsible for ensuring adequate training for new/transferred team members and providing any necessary guidance.  Contractors must have the ability to effectively communicate with clear and concise thoughts both verbally and in writing.  While contractors will be responsible for organizing assignments, they will exercise no supervisory authority over any other contractor.  Contractors will not have the authority to discipline, withdraw clearances, issue awards, or represent themselves as supervisory.  The contractors position described in this Statement of Work is managerial in terms of cases, not in terms of personnel.

Contractors duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested. Contractors will be paid at the rate of $59.50 per hour for each hour up to and including 40 hours or otherwise established rate as determined by ATF.  Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $89.25; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner.  Each contactor must work a minimum number of 34 hours; working at a minimum four (4) days each week.  Contractors shall not work more than ten hours per day without prior approval from their COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors schedules are subject to final approval by ATF.  Contractors are responsible for coordinating adequate office coverage for their respective team; to include holidays and high vacation/travel months.  Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract.

In compliance with ATFs specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractors invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work.  ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support e-mail, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one (1) per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATFs computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.  Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Each contractor shall undergo a personnel security investigation to determine their suitability to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, and/or data.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch (PSB), and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish.  Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated background investigation and receive a Top Secret clearance.  The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 90 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues.

Failure to timely complete the required background forms, or failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or information technology systems will not be authorized.

Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that does not contribute to ATF being portrayed in a negative light.  To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired.  Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.  

Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected.  Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance. 

Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to you by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain.  Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession.  Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department. 

Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information.  Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act and, unless classified, is considered Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) information.  SBU information must not be transmitted via unsecured e-mail or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties.  Contractors must never furnish or divulge SBU information contained a background investigation record.

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. 

ATF intends to issue contractors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through June 30, 2013.  The solicitation will close June 30, 2008 at 
4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation due to attrition.  

Contractors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected contractors are in a position to furnish, and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected contractor, or the call will be transferred to another contractor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all contractors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Contractor.

ATF will consider BPAs to contractors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the contractors assent to ATFs terms and conditions, including the hourly rate.  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  Any contractor failing to comply with these mandatory requirements will be eliminated.  Contractors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Contractors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Contractors with an overall score of at least 75 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those contractors receiving the highest scores if a position is available.  At least 45 points must come from Offer or Demonstrated Experience / Qualifications and at least 30 points must come from Contractor Past Performance / Capabilities.


a. Experience/Qualifications (60 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three (3) years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each contractors experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the Federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the contractors communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (45 points minimum).

b. Past Performance/Capabilities (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a contractor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the contractors customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the contractor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the contractors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the contractor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the contractor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (30 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each contractor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A contractors offer is acceptable when it manifests the contractors assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a contractor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Contractors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

To request a copy of the Statement of Work, please submit a written request via email to SIAdministration@atf.gov.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:     "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.     "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.     (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.     (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:     (i) warrants;     (ii) options;     (iii) contracts to acquire stock;     (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.     (f) Disclosure.     By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 27 June 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 24 June 2008.     PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.     Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6790.

<p>This effort will require "Haworth" brand name products be provided.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 6.302-1(c),&nbsp;an acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. It shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. See 5.102(a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand name justification.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 5.102(a)(6), when an acquisition contains brand name specifications, the contracting officer shall include with the solicitation the justification or documentation required by 6.302-1(c), 13.106-1(b), or 13.501, redacted as necessary (see 6.305).</p>

<p>The items are being procured to provide a comfortable and professional educational environment for all USAFSAM students. It is vital that the current professional appearance of the significant amount of existing Haworth furniture which was purchased for the USAFSAM last year be maintained to ensure a tasteful and professional environment continues to exist for the medical student attendees.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation SB1341-08-RQ-0336 is hereby amended to address the following vendor question and answer:

Question:  Specification No. 1 states Device shall employ static volumetric gas sorption method for determining adsorption and desorption isotherms.  Additional capability to perform dynamic volumetric measurement is considered beneficial, a dynamic gas adsorption instrument and a volumetric instrument are two completely different techniques.  A dynamic technique is not a volumetric technique. Can you please clarify what is meant by this specification?

Answer: NIST requires a static volumetric gas sorption instrument. It is NISTs understanding that some static volumetric systems are also capable of performing dynamic volumetric measurements. This additional capability would be considered a benefit, but is not a requirement. Should the quoter offer completely separate instruments for static and dynamic measurements, quoter should only bid on a static volumetric system, since that is the principal need.

The due date and time remains unchanged, all quotes shall be received not later than 3pm, local time, on June 16, 2008.

If the system is set to let light through at 500 nm only and measure the amount of light out of the system spectrally, then the fractional amount of light measured at other wavelengths (> 3 times the bandpass away) must be less than 0.1 % of the amount of light at 500 nm (integrated over the bandpass of the system)

<SOLNBR>FERC08-RFP-80999
<RESPDATE>062008
<CONTACT>Sanjay Sardar, Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO), Email FERC08-RFP-8099@ferc.gov
<DESC>								02 June 2008
Request for Proposal:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO)  has a requirement for Independent Test and Evaluation Authority (ITEA) to support quality assurance process for the FERC IT Systems. In order to meet the needs of this requirement, the FERC has determined that the most expeditions method of reviewing and evaluating all offeror capabilities would be through oral presentations.  As such, your are invited to review the technical statement of work located at www.ferc.gov, and specifically, http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp.  You are also instructed to review RFP FERC08-RFP-80148, located at the same URL address, because your ability to perform ITEA for the services procured under this competition may also be required during the life of the awarded ITEA contract.
.
In order to meet federal competitive requirements as well as program schedule requirements, the FERC has determined that a competition utilizing streamlined procedures is the best overall approach to meet these goals.  As previously stated, all potential offerors shall provide their technical approach utilizing an oral presentation.  This process possesses certain rules that the offeror must abide by.  Failure to follow the following rules shall render the presentation non responsive, and therefore, unavailable for award.

-	Technical Solution and Methodology must conform to the requirements of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02,  2008, and located at http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp
-	Only technical information shall be presented
-	No more than 30 slides 
-	The presentation shall not require a presentation lasting more than 60 minutes
-	The offeror shall provide a detailed response for each evaluation factor listed in Section 3. of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02, 2008. 
-	Questions are due not later than Tuesday, June 10, 2008, 5:00PM EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this date/time shall cause you to forfeit your opportunity to submit questions.
-	Oral Presentation offers are due not later than Friday, June 20, 2008, 5:00PM, EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this deadline shall render your oral presentation nonresponsive and therefore unavailable for award.

Once received, the FERC may require some or all of the offerors to present their oral presentations to a technical evaluation team.  Conversely, the FERC may decide that a competitive range be established without benefit of holding presentations. Under either scenario, you will be notified via email. If oral presentations are to be held, all date/time slots shall be randomly assigned.  It is the intention of this competition to award a single contract to one firm (or a team of firms for which the lead offeror is accountable) for the work to be performed and on the basis of the overall best value to the government.  As such, upon completion of the technical review, the government team shall down select to three (3) or fewer technical proposals, thereby establishing the competitive range.  Those offerors chosen for the competitive range shall be notified via email and a cost proposal shall be requested.  Upon evaluation of the cost proposal, the government shall enter discussions with one or more offerors, if necessary.  Award shall be made to that offeror determined to be the best overall value to the government. The government reserves the right to award to the lowest priced offeror.

<DESC>NOTE:  ORIGINAL NOTICE MODIFIED TO ADD DKO CONOPS REFERENCE TO ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES PARAGRAPH, AND ATTACH CONOPS DOCUMENT ALONG WITH 3 AKO STATISTICAL GRAPHS.
 This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a Request for Information (RFI).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The RFP number W91QUZ-08-R-0047 was entered as a requirement to allow the posting of this RFI.  Therefore, the use of W91QUZ-08-R-0047 is not an indication of future action, beyond this RFI.<BR><BR>This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201e. It does not constitute a <BR>Request for Proposal RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Responses to this notice shall not be construed as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued.  The release of AKO/DKO documentation is limited to United States corporations and United States citizens. <BR><BR>The Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO-EIS) and other DoD agencies seek information and comment regarding potential strategies for the design, development, installation and operation and maintaining of the world largest corporate intranet.  Known initially as Army Knowledge Online (AKO), this intranet is transitioning, expanding and being recast as AKO and Defense Knowledge Online (AKO/DKO).  While a significant amount of the transformation has occurred, not all technologies, tools and methods have been finalized. PEO-EIS anticipates awarding an AKO/DKO follow-on support contract before March 2010.  While the reengineering effort is not assured, the multi-service DoD team seeks to investigate potential solutions and architecture approaches that identify best practices, migration strategies, and technologies that will advance DoD knowledge management.  <BR><BR>Questions regarding this RFI will not be entertained.  The Army intends to issue a draft RFP in the 4th Quarter of FY08 which will provide additional information.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the purposes of this RFI and eventual draft RFP is 541519, with an associated small business size of $23 Million dollars. <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White<BR>Paper, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, and supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed ten (10) slides. Contractors are urged to limit marketing material in order to provide more substantive information in their response.  Responses are to be submitted via e-mail, in Microsoft Word, 2003 compatible, to Woodrow Bell, at drow.bell@us.army.mil, not later than 9 July 2008. If there are any questions, Mr. Bell can be reached by phone at (703) 325-4760.<BR><BR>AKO/DKO BACKGROUND: AKO/DKO is being built on the current AKO enterprise portal structure.  AKO was started as a pilot project in 1997 and was so successful that the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff mandated that all data, information and systems be moved behind this portal.  The AKO portal represented the first step in building the Army intranet.  AKO is the principal tool used in transforming the Army to a knowledge based organization. The current AKO/DKO is constructed around Appian Enterprise business process management (BPM) technologies with many customized Enterprise Content Management (ECM) features. <BR><BR>The current AKO/DKO enterprise portal provides Army and DoD personnel with access to business related and mission-oriented knowledge in real time.  At present, the AKO/DKO enterprise portal, consists of a primary site at Fort Belvoir, a secondary site in Maryland, and a third site in Southwest Asia. All sites are connected to both unclassified, but sensitive nonsecure internet protocol router (NIPRNet) and secret internet protocol router (SIPRNet) networks.  The scope includes systems operation and maintenance, network and systems engineering support, hardware and software integration, software development and maintenance, application development and maintenance, Army-wide help desk support, and senior level technology and program management support services. Services are provided on a continuous 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year basis.   AKO/DKO provides single sign-on access to over 400 applications and experiences approximately 800,000 unique users 15 million times per month with peak bandwidth usage of 500 Mbps.  DKO also provides user access to the DODs core enterprise services of DISAs Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) program.  A key tenet of DKO is that it uses, and does not duplicate, services provided by NCES on the DODs NIPRNET and SIPRNET, for purposes of both cost efficiency and to promote interoperability and information sharing within the DOD, and amongst DODs Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational Mission (JIIM) partners.  <BR><BR> GovWorks, Department of Interiors contracting office, competitively awarded the original AKO contract in June 2002.  The final option period on that contract expired on 30 Sep 07.  As an interim solution, a task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman (NG) on 5 March 2007 against the Air Forces NETCENTS contract until emerging requirements could be stabilized.  If the final option period is exercised, this task order will expire in March 2010.  Since 2002, the Army has spent approximately $425M on the Program.  The Not to Exceed Amount on the present task order is $267M with a remainder of approximately $112 million before expiration of the task order.  <BR><BR>ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIAL: The Government may make reference/reading material available.  If reference/reading material is made available, an amendment to this notice will be issued with instructions.  <BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>The primary acquisition objective of AKO/DKO is to obtain a solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a standard Information Technology infrastructure to support the Government in meeting both the AKO and DKO missions.  As such, the Government anticipates that some or all of the following objectives of this requirement will be as follows:<BR><BR>a.  Building on the current AKO/DKO solution (hardware, software, infrastructure), provide a best-in-class, secure, interoperable, scalable, and upgradeable solution for AKO and DKO that focuses on a user-friendly interface, rapid access to on-line content and applications and outstanding customer service for approximately 2.5 million AKO and 8 million  DKO end-users.  Note: The number of users is an initial estimate only.  The number of users ultimately provided service pursuant to AKO and DKO could vary drastically, either more or less, than the stated number of users.  As a rule of thumb, the population of users to be supported on the SIPRNET is approximately 15% of those on unclassified networks.<BR><BR>b. Ensure a seamless/transparent transition from other portals to DKO per the DKO Continuity of Operations (CONOPS), and from the existing contract to this contract, improving current process standards and procedures.<BR><BR>c. Under a performance-based arrangement, award to a contractor committed to delivering a, highly reliable, user friendly, timely, and secure IT solution that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations.  Incentives that reward offerors that provide a method for DoD to save costs and encourage the shutdown of other portals across DoD in favor of using DKO are being contemplated.<BR><BR>d. Provide evolutionary, robust and user-friendly enterprise portal Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) toolsets capable of integrating best of breed in messaging, work flow, collaboration suites, content management, data retrieval search, taxonomy, and other services as required.<BR><BR>e. Assure that AKO and DKO services are provided to any connected AKO and DKO user anywhere at any time  to include a network-challenged environment.  The system must be responsive and reliable to users at the network edge.  Provide responsive and competent user assistance available 24/7.  <BR><BR>f. Assure DKO provides ubiquitous access to DoD and non DoD web-based business applications and is interoperable with the DoD Enterprise Architecture.  <BR><BR>g. Ensure security compliance/information assurance, including physical security, for AKO and DKO, its data, and users.<BR><BR>h. Provide security architecture that is scalable to 8 million users.  Consider DODD 8500 series including FIPS 140-2 compliance for both data in transit and data at rest.<BR><BR>i. Provide the single entry point (single sign-on) into the DoD network through DKO allowing common access, security, authentication, and presentation solution (common look and feel) for all DoD network services.  Solution should be a modular, plug-and-play, standalone design.  As single sign-on may alternatively be provided from some other government source, a standards-based interface would have to be provided to enable this function to operate seamlessly within the DKO enterprise portal.<BR><BR>j. Provide an architecture that demonstrates the capability to provide external    policy management capability for AKO and DKO, and the ability to deny access to areas within the portal based on policy management decisions, in compliance with DoD standards.<BR><BR>k. Ensure DKO continues to operate at required levels (including Continuity of Operations (COOP)/DR) (spell out DR) during any software or hardware changes, upgrades or disasters.<BR><BR>l. Ensure new capabilities are adequately tested to prevent adverse impact to operations or the users experience during portal modifications and upgrades.  Provide user training to increase awareness of DKO functionality.  <BR><BR>m. Provide market research and recommendations focused on continuous capability improvements.  Provide a roadmap for future DKO improvements with an established and predictable release cycle.<BR><BR>n. Provide Help Desk services for customer service and technical reporting purposes.  Operations should be 24/7/365 and available to all AKO and DKO users.  Offeror may, but is not required to maintain the current Help Desk operations and can propose alternative arrangements.  Offeror must propose performance standards applicable to this type of operation.<BR><BR>o. The AKO/DKO enterprise portal must be able to support both convergence and federation of other DoD portals depending on business and mission needs.<BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:  <BR><BR>This contract will be a systems integration contract to both operate and maintain the current AKO/DKO enterprise portal and to design, install, transition and maintain the future AKO and DKO portal(s) in accordance with the concepts outlined in the DKO Strategic Concept of Operations (CONOPS).   A copy of the DKO CONOPS Architecture briefing will be provided that provides a graphical representation of the DKO CONOPS way forward.  The DKO enterprise portal will provide universal, secure access for world-wide DoD operations.  DKO will be the single point of entry into the DoDs Intranets (including AKO) for both the business side and for deployed personnel to achieve reach-back to their sustaining bases for essential mission and critical support processes, especially for forces in remote geographic areas such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  The future AKO/DKO enterprise portal(s) will be designed in such a way that there will be no virtual loss of functionality to the current AKO requirements.  <BR><BR>SCOPE:<BR><BR>CURRENT SYSTEM:<BR><BR>It is expected that the successful offeror will have complete program management responsibility at all three sites.   The scope includes systems operation and maintenance, network and systems engineering support, hardware and software integration, software development and maintenance, application development and maintenance, DoD-wide help desk support, and senior level technology and program management support services. Services must be provided, without disruption, on a continuous 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year basis.   The successful offeror will provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to DoD personnel (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines); Active, National Guard, and Reserve soldiers and their sponsored guests; DoD Civilians; applicable contractors; and JIMM partners.<BR><BR>FUTURE SYSTEM:<BR><BR>Contingent on available funding, the future AKO and DKO enterprise portal(s) system(s) may be moved into an Army Area Processing Center (APC) and/or within Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC).  These systems may either entail the use of space leased within these facilities with government-purchased equipment and application software installed (but with government rights instilled) or the use of DISA or contractor-provided managed services for equipment needs and the contractor application software installed.  The contractor would be responsible for all coordination efforts necessary for the moves.  In addition to the three current physical sites, additional in-country and/or overseas sites may be added to add security, capacity and functionality. The reengineered AKO/DKO intranet must scale to 8 million users, including active duty and retired service personnel, their family members and contractors, and possibly other government agencies.  <BR><BR>ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT:<BR><BR>a. A successful offeror must be able to operate the AKO/DKO enterprise portal as soon as possible after contract award; complete implementation of the ongoing system upgrades already in progress; and then transition to a leadership role in the technical, managerial and organizational evolution of the AKO and DKO enterprise portal without disruption to current AKO/DKO services and capabilities.  <BR><BR>b. The successful offeror will play a significant role in creating the most efficient and effective AKO/DKO enterprise portal using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts in the DoDs Service Oriented Environment, and the most up-to-date, modular plug-and-play applications. The Government will consider both new and existing system designs in both software and underlying hardware platforms to provide a continuous, high-quality service to AKO and DKO users.<BR><BR>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: <BR><BR>a. The AKO/DKO Enterprise Services contractor will have the responsibility for the continued development of AKO and DKO functionality. The Government seeks help in identifying AKO and DKO user needs, back-end business application needs, and overall functional enhancements. The Government also seeks the establishment of strong processes to formalize the development and facilitate the prioritization of AKO and DKO improvements.<BR><BR>b. With regards to FAR subpart 27-Rights and Copyrights, the contractor shall be required to provide the Government with sufficient technical and non-technical data and data rights, computer software, software documentation and software rights, as well as rights in other relevant information and documentation.  The rights received or retained by the Government must be sufficient to ensure that the form, fit, function and appearance of the AKO and DKO can be preserved for any follow-on award.<BR><BR>CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS: The current AKO/DKO systems infostructure consists mainly of contractor and government-owned components. The Government furnishes some government furnished equipment (GFE), as well as the facilities at the primary and secondary sites. The primary and secondary sites are exact images of each other, each sharing the AKO/DKO user load. The current contractor provides AKO/DKO as a service using, in part, the GFE. The Government is presently considering several alternatives with regards to the acquisition strategy.  They include but are not limited to a managed solution, also called managed services, or a co-location arrangement:<BR><BR>For the purposes of this potential acquisition a Management Service Provider or Managed Service Provider (MSP) is an organization that would manage AKO/DKO computer systems and networks which are located on DoD premises or at a third-party datacenter.  MSPs offer a variety of service levels from notifying the Government if problems occur to making all necessary repairs.  MSPs may also be a source for hardware and staff for its AKO/DKO customers.   A service provider may also simply deliver infrastructure management services on a subscription basis, similar to the model used by application service providers.  <BR><BR>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), also known as on-demand software delivery.<BR><BR>The Government may seek to move existing Army GFE from the Fort Belvoir and Maryland sites to a Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and procure system management support services.   In this case, the Government would require the Army GFE be moved to the DECC.  Any additional equipment needed for the system would be Government provided through the DECC.<BR><BR>The Government is presently considering two options to meet its requirements as follows:<BR><BR>Option 1. <BR><BR> a.  In this option, the contractor will be required to operate and maintain the current system in one or more possible scenarios. Under one scenario, it is expected that the Government will provide the necessary hosting facilities at the current location. However, funding constraints may prevent the Government from acquiring or leasing all the equipment necessary for AKO/DKO to function.  Consequently, the Government may not be able to provide as all GFE necessary to operate and maintain AKO/DKO.  In this event, the selected contractor may be required to use its own equipment and resources to operate and maintain the AKO/DKO.  As part of this option, the contractor will likely also be required to propose to operate the system as a managed service at the present three locations. The offeror will be required to propose such a solution and an associated transition plan.  <BR><BR>b. A different scenario involves moving the equipment presently owned by the Government from its present location at the Fort Belvoir and Maryland sites to a DECC.  In this case, the offeror would be required to move the GFE to the DECC.  Any additional equipment needed for the system would be furnished by the DECC and furnished to the contractor as GFE.  The offeror would be required to coordinate the effort on behalf of the government.  The offeror will be required to propose such a solution to ensure operation during and after the transition to the DECC, and an associated transition plan.  <BR><BR>c. In either case, the contractor will be required to design a future solution for an entirely new AKO/DKO system to be located in at least two DECCs and the associated transition plan.  The equipment at the Southwest Asia site will remain in place.<BR><BR>Option 2. <BR><BR>Depending on the supporting business case and availability of funding, a different approach may be pursued.  Instead of being required to maintain the current AKO/DKO system in-place, the contractor would be required to immediately design, install, and maintain a new AKO/DKO equipment and software design at two or more DECCs using managed services. The offeror would be required to coordinate the effort on behalf of the government and to provide a plan for the transition of services from the existing contractor to the new DECC facilities. The contractor would be required to show that this approach was technically superior, and could be provided at a reduced cost.<BR><BR>Alternative Solution.<BR><BR>The contractor may present an alternate solution under the RFI.<BR>.  <BR>PERFORMANCE-BASED ACQUISITION (PBA): The AKO/DKO contract, if awarded, may use performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Statement of Objectives or a Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>TERM: The AKO/DKO contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with at least four one-year options.<BR><BR> QUESTIONS: The Government is requesting comments on the above options, and is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the RFP. <BR><BR>1.   How difficult would it be to implement a solution in which the Government provides a limited set of equipment as GFE?  In this event the Government would likely not be in a position to acquire or lease all equipment necessary for AKO/DKO to function.  Rather, the contractor would be required to provide AKO/DKO as a service using its own resources.  Please explain the advantages and disadvantages with this approach.<BR>2.   What factors should the Government consider when determining whether to transition DKO from one Content Management System (CMS) to another, i.e., from one support model to another? <BR>3. Is a partial managed service agreement practical, where the Government and service provider divide AKO/DKO services in both the classified and unclassified environments?  What about dividing between the classified and unclassified environments? Is a public-private partnership feasible to deliver AKO/DKO?<BR>4. With regards to FAR Subpart 27, what other factors should be considered regarding software licenses and Configuration Management?  How would you recommend handling software licenses issues?<BR>5. What specific detail or additional information beyond the information provided in the reading room is needed in order to bid on the complete requirement?<BR>6. What contract type(s) would be most beneficial to both the Government and the<BR>contractor?<BR>7. How long would it take to transition from the existing contract to the new contract?<BR>8. What logical portions of work are suitable for small business (SB) participation on an<BR>effort of this size?  What SB subcontracting goals have you achieved on similar efforts?   <BR>9. What contractual incentives would motivate outstanding performance? In what areas can performance most effectively be incentivized?<BR>10. If the Government decides on a fully MSP, what performance areas should be incentivized?  What metrics are typically used?)<BR>11. What portal and data/content management best practices are used by industry?<BR>12. How does industry leverage portals to ensure effective support to multi-functional<BR>elements of the organization, and what lessons learned can they share? <BR>13. How would you monitor DKO service availability and quality?<BR>14.  With regards to future trends, what should the Government consider in assessing future capabilities?<BR>15. What are the industry standards for portal maintenance? What are the cost drivers unique to portal maintenance?<BR>16.  If the Government chooses SaaS, how would you propose the Government determine ownership of the services?<BR>17. What would be a rough order of magnitude of cost for both Option 1 and Option 2 and any proposed Alternative Solution?<BR>18. How could DKO best improve information sharing within DOD and with DODs mission partners in accordance with the DOD Net-Centric Data and Services Strategies while maintaining information assurance?<BR>19.  DKO provides one of the core enterprise services of DISAs NCES program:  User Access.  As such, DKOs User Access is the requirement, and must fully integrate with and use the other services provided by NCES.  What special contract provisions, if any, are desired to assure reliable and cost-effective service to DOD end-users in this scenario?<BR><BR>

<DESC>This amendment does NOT change the Offer Due Date of June 18, 2008.<BR><BR>Questions and Answers:<BR><BR>(For questions 1  16 see Amendment #01) <BR><BR><BR>17. Would a German virtual environment also cover host nation Belgium and Italy?  <BR><BR>A.  German specific is acceptable but adaptations for Belgium and Italian conditions are necessary.  While most international signs are similar across Europe, Road conditions and lane markings vary considerably.<BR><BR> <BR>18.  Manual gearshift with clutch operation is required / is automatic gearshift without clutch suitable? <BR><BR>A.  No.  Many of our IFMS vehicles are manual therefore manual and clutch operation is required.<BR> <BR><BR>19.  Expected field of view (100 / 180 or more degrees)?  An expected field of view was not stated.  Is 100 degrees a realistic driving scenario field of view?  <BR><BR>A.  One hundred degrees is not considered to be a realistic field of view.  Driving simulators shall be at least 180 degrees.<BR><BR><BR>20. Rearview mirrors (1/2/3 ??)?<BR><BR>A.  Cabin shall have at least one review mirror.  Three mirrors (two side mirrors) like a regular car is more realistic and would be preferable.<BR><BR><BR>21.  Possibility for backing up?<BR><BR>A.  Backup simulation would be preferred.<BR><BR><BR>22.  When we adapt our simulators to foreign countries conditions we<BR>differ between the adaptation to the traffic rules and the adaptation to the language. In your case, should we execute all texts in English and adapt to the traffic rules in the three countries Germany, Belgium and Italy?<BR><BR>A.  Yes.<BR><BR><BR>23.  Should we also adapt our simulators to the traffic rules in the<BR>United States?<BR><BR>A.  Yes (see PWS para. 3).  <BR><BR><BR>24.  SF1449 - CLIN ITEM NOs. 0001AA through 0003 specify that we<BR>are to quote FOB: Destination.  The various CLINs have destinations of Belgium, Italy and several different addresses in Germany.  However, Block 15 of SF1449 states to DELIVER TO:IMCOM EUROPE, APO, AE. <BR><BR>A.  The delivery addresses are to each address listed in 0001AA, 0001AB, etc. Please disregard what Block #15 states.<BR><BR><BR>25.  Is our quoted price to include freight charges to<BR>the Final Destination Points in Germany, Belgium and Italy or just to the APO, AE.  Please detail the responsibility regarding export.  <BR><BR>A.  Quotes shall include prices to each of the specific final destination local addresses, not the APO address.<BR><BR><BR>26.  Regarding FAR 52.223-15 Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming<BR>Products. QUESTION: Driving Simulators are not listed products on the<BR>Energy Star Program Website.  Please advise whether this clause is applicable to subcomponents of the Product (e.g. Computers, Monitors, etc.) <BR><BR>A.  Computers and monitors are a major sub component and will be used in a federal facility, so the clause would apply.<BR><BR><BR>27.  Regarding ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1 [1].  This clause states that we are to include TIN, NCAGE Code and DUNS Number..... <BR>QUESTION:  ETC is a U.S. corporation; and as such, we have a CAGE<BR>Code.  It is our understanding that Foreign Registrants in CCR must have a NATO Cage(NCAGE) Code assigned.  Please clarify. <BR><BR>A.  If you already have a (US) CAGE code, list it.  A NATO cage code would then not apply.  NCAGE codes are for foreign companies that do not have US CAGE codes and need to become CCR registered.<BR><BR>28.  Regarding FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications<BR>QUESTION: Clause [k] (Page 30 of 32)states Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. ......  [The Contracting Officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph<BR>k) (1) or (k) (2) applies.]    Please clarify since neither block is checked. <BR><BR>A. #2 applies.<BR><BR>End of Q&A.

Add the following Clause and its Alternate II to the solicitation:52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan.As prescribed in 19.708(b), insert the following clause:Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Apr 2008)(a) This clause does not apply to small business concerns.(b) Definitions. As used in this clause-"Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)" means any Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, Urban Corporation, or Group Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.) and which is considered a minority and economically disadvantaged concern under the criteria at 43 U.S.C. 1626(e)(1). This definition also includes ANC direct and indirect subsidiary corporations, joint ventures, and partnerships that meet the requirements of 43 U.S.C. 1626 (e)(2)."Commercial item" means a product or service that satisfies the definition of commercial item in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation."Commercial plan" means a subcontracting plan (including goals) that covers the offeror's fiscal year and that applies to the entire production of commercial items sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line)."Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS)" means the Governmentwide, electronic, web-based system for small business subcontracting program reporting. The eSRS is located at http://www.esrs.gov."Indian tribe" means any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community, including native villages and native groups (including corporations organized by Kenai, Juneau, Sitka, and Kodiak) as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C.A. 1601 et seq.), that is recognized by the Federal Government as eligible for services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1452(c). This definition also includes Indian-owned economic enterprises that meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 1452(e)."Individual contract plan" means a subcontracting plan that covers the entire contract period (including option periods), applies to a specific contract, and has goals that are based on the offeror's planned subcontracting in support of the specific contract except that indirect costs incurred for common or joint purposes may be allocated on a prorated basis to the contract."Master plan" means a subcontracting plan that contains all the required elements of an individual contract plan, except goals, and may be incorporated into individual contract plans, provided the master plan has been approved."Subcontract" means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime Contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.(c) The offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business concerns, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business, and with women-owned small business concerns. If the offeror is submitting an individual contract plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns with a separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.(d) The offeror's subcontracting plan shall include the following:(1) Goals, expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. The offeror shall include all subcontracts that contribute to contract performance, and may include a proportionate share of products and services that are normally allocated as indirect costs. In accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1626:(i) Subcontracts awarded to an ANC or Indian tribe shall be counted towards the subcontracting goals for small business and small disadvantages business (SDB) concerns, regardless of the size or Small Business Administration certification status of the ANC or Indian tribe.(ii) Where one or more subcontractors are in the subcontract tier between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate the appropriate contractor(s) to count the subcontract towards its small business and small disadvantaged business subcontracting goals.(A) In most cases, the appropriate Contractor is the Contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe.(B) If the ANC or Indian tribe designates more than one Contractor to count the subcontract toward its goals, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate only a portion of the total subcontract award to each Contrator. The sum of the amounts designated to various Contractors cannot exceed the total value of the subcontract.(C) The ANC or Indian tribe shall give a copy of the written designation to the Contracting Officer, the prime Contractor, and the subcontractors in between the prime Contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe within 30 days of the date of the subcontract award.(D) If the Contracting Officer does not receive a copy of the ANC's or the Indian tribe's written designation within 30 days of the subcontract award, the Contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe will be considered the designated Contractor.(2) A statement of-(i) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted for an individual contract plan; or the offeror's total projected sales, expressed in dollars, and the total value of projected subcontracts to support the sales for a commercial plan;(ii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business concerns (including ANC and Indian tribes);(iii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to veteran-owned small business concerns;(iv) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business;(v) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to HUBZone small business concerns;(vi) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns (including ANCs and Indian tribes); and(vii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to women-owned small business concerns.(3) A description of the principal types of supplies and services to be subcontracted, and an identification of the types planned for subcontracting to --(i) Small business concerns,(ii) Veteran-owned small business concerns;(iii) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns;(iv) HUBZone small business concerns;(v) Small disadvantaged business concerns, and(vi) Women-owned small business concerns.(4) A description of the method used to develop the subcontracting goals in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause.(5) A description of the method used to identify potential sources for solicitation purposes (e.g., existing company source lists, the Central Contractor Registration database (CCR), veterans service organizations, the National Minority Purchasing Council Vendor Information Service, the Research and Information Division of the Minority Business Development Agency in the Department of Commerce, or small, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business trade associations). A firm may rely on the information contained in CCR as an accurate representation of a concern's size and ownership characteristics for the purposes of maintaining a small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business source list. Use of CCR as its source list does not relieve a firm of its responsibilities (e.g., outreach, assistance, counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.(6) A statement as to whether or not the offeror included indirect costs in establishing subcontracting goals, and a description of the method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with --(i) Small business concerns (including ANC and Indian tribes);(ii) Veteran-owned small business concerns;(iii) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns;(iv) HUBZone small business concerns;(v) Small disadvantaged business concerns (including ANC and Indian tribes); and(vi) Women-owned small business concerns.(7) The name of the individual employed by the offeror who will administer the offeror's subcontracting program, and a description of the duties of the individual.(8) A description of the efforts the offeror will make to assure that small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts.(9) Assurances that the offeror will include the clause of this contract entitled "Utilization of Small Business Concerns" in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities, and that the offeror will require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) that receive subcontracts in excess of $550,000 ($1,000,000 for construction of any public facility with further subcontracting possibilities) to adopt a plan similar to the plan that complies with the requirements of this clause.(10) Assurances that the offeror will --(i) Cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required;(ii) Submit periodic reports so that the Government can determine the extent of compliance by the offeror with the subcontracting plan;(iii) Submit the Individual Subcontracting Report (ISR) and/or the Summary Subcontract Report (SSR), in accordance with the paragraph (l) of this clause using the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at http://esrs.gov. The reports shall provide information on subcontract awards to small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, women-owned small business concerns, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions. Reporting shall be in accordance with this clause, or as provided in agency regulations;(iv) Ensure that its subcontractors with subcontracting plans agree to submit the ISR and/or the SSR using eSRS;(v) Provide its prime contract number, its DUNS number, and the e-mail address of the Government or Contractor official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the reports, to all first-tier subcontractors with subcontracting plans so they can enter this information into the eSRS when submitting their reports; and (vi) Require that each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan provide the prime contract number, its own DUNS number, and the e-mail address of the Government or Contractor official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the reports, to its subcontractors with subcontracting plans.(11) A description of the types of records that will be maintained concerning procedures that have been adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the plan, including establishing source lists; and a description of the offeror's efforts to locate small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns and award subcontracts to them. The records shall include at least the following (on a plant-wide or company-wide basis, unless otherwise indicated):(i) Source lists (e.g., CCR), guides, and other data that identify small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.(ii) Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate sources that are small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concerns.(iii) Records on each subcontract solicitation resulting in an award of more than $100,000, indicating --(A) Whether small business concerns were solicited and if not, why not;(B) Whether veteran-owned small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not;(C) Whether service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not;(D) Whether HUBZone small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not;(E) Whether small disadvantaged business concerns were solicited and if not, why not;(F) Whether women-owned small business concerns were solicited and if not, why not; and(G) If applicable, the reason award was not made to a small business concern.(iv) Records of any outreach efforts to contact --(A) Trade associations;(B) Business development organizations; (C) Conferences and trade fairs to locate small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business sources; and(D) Veterans service organizaions.(v) Records of internal guidance and encouragement provided to buyers through --(A) Workshops, seminars, training, etc., and(B) Monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program's requirements.(vi) On a contract-by-contract basis, records to support award data submitted by the offeror to the Government, including the name, address, and business size of each subcontractor. Contractors having commercial plans need not comply with this requirement.(e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall perform the following functions:(1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor's lists of potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time.(2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in all "make-or-buy" decisions.(3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with representatives of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business firms.(4) Confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is identified as a certified HUBZone small business concern by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database or by contacting SBA.(5) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and remedies for misrepresentations of business status as small, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained in the Contractor's subcontracting plan.(f) A master plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the offeror by this clause; provided --(1) The master plan has been approved;(2) The offeror ensures that the master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting Officer; and(3) Goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan.(g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. The commercial plan shall relate to the offeror's planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely to the Government contract. Once the Contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government will not require another subcontracting plan from the same Contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the Contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item. A contractor with a commercial plan shall comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (d)(10) of this clause by submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report shall be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the Contracting Officer who approved the plan. This report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government's fiscal year.(h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.(i) A contract may have no more than one plan. When a modification meets the criteria in 19.702 for a plan, or an option is exercised, the goals associated with the modification or option shall be added to those in the existing subcontract plan.(j) Subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains the clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, or when the subcontractor provides a commercial item subject to the clause at 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items, under a prime contract.(k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with-(1) The clause of this contract entitled "Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;" or(2) An approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract.(l) The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov. Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract award data reported by prime Contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made to lower tier subcontractors unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian tribe.(1) ISR. This report is not required for commercial plans. The report is required for each contract containing an individual subcontract plan and shall be submitted to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or Contracting Officer, if no ACO is assigned. (i) The report shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period.(ii) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as prescribed by FAR 19.704(c), the dollar goal inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second option is exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and the second option.(iii) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides-(A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and(B) In the case of a subcontract with a subcontracting plan, with the entity that awarded the subcontract.(2) SSR.(i) Reports submitted under individual contract plans-(A) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and subcontracts with the awarding agency, regardless of the dollar value of the subcontracts.(B) The report may be submitted on a corporate, company or subdivision (e.g. plant or division operating as a separate profit center) basis, unless otherwise directed by the agency.CONTINUED ON TO AMENDMENT 3

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:Technical, past performance, subcontracting (FAR 52.219-9 Alternate II), and price.Technical is more important than past performance.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Selection of a Contractor will be made by an integrated assessment of the proposals submitted and in light of the following criteria. The integrated assessment will involve a determination by the Government of the overall merit of each offerors proposal, recognizing that subjective judgment on the part of the Government evaluators is implicit in the entire process.  All offerors proposals will be evaluated for technical quality and quantity and assigned an adjectival rating based upon the criteria set forth herein.A price analysis will be performed.  If no award on initial offers, then the procedures of FAR Subpart 15.3-Source Selection will be followed in making a recommendation for award which will be provided to the Contracting Officer as a basis for final determination. Award will be made to the offeror whom the Government determines will be able to accomplish the necessary work in the manner most advantageous to the Government and whose offer represents the best value to the Government, as determined by the Evaluation Board after considering all factors, including price. The evaluation of technical capabilities will be accomplished without reference to price. All factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award are listed below.2.  Technical and Management Capability --- Vendor must demonstrate sufficient technical and management capability to manage the work required by this contract.3.  Past Performance --- The evaluation of Past Performance is a subjective assessment of the Offerors Past Performance on contracts of a similar nature, size, scope, and complexity, utilizing a comparable number of personnel with like skills.  The Government will consider the combined Offerors and proposed subcontractorsexperience and performance in providing services consistent with the scope and complexity of our requirement during the last three (3) calendar years. The Governments assessment will focus on contracts that meet the followingconditions:	Recency  Only contracts that were performed or awarded within the last three (3) calendar years will be considered.	Relevancy  Only contracts which were/are relevant in scope to the current requirement will be considered. In the case of an offeror without any relevant past performance history, past performance will be evaluated as neutral. If the past performance information is negative, the offeror may be given an opportunity to provide rebuttal if it has not previously had such an opportunity.4.  Subcontracting  Offeror is to submit the plan required by FAR 52.219-9 Alternate II  if subcontracting opportunities exist.5.  Price Proposals ---  Price proposals will not be rated, but will beevaluated for reasonableness by price analysis. Price will be considered as an independent element from the technical and past performance evaluations.

The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 16-19, 2008, at The Riviera Hotel Convention Center located at 2901 Las Vegas Blvd., South, Las Vegas, NV  89109.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give current information on FAA procurement opportunities (such as construction, information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities support services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, security guard services, architectural and training services etc.)

The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses  by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.  Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA.
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during one-on-one marketing sessions with large primes, federal agency technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops (i.e., Harris, ITT, Tremco, AMTI, Lockheed Martin, Parsons, L-3 Communications, Wells Fargo, GEICO, Raytheon and many more.)

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit comments from potential sources from academia and industry on the solicitation approach and the clarity of the High Performance Computing Modernization Program Offices (HPCMPO) draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) Program.   This RFI and the SOO may be viewed on the DoD HPCMP web site at http://www.hpcmo.hpc.mil/PETTT business_opps.htm .  The HPCMPO was established in 1993 to perform life cycle management and acquisition oversight for the High Performance Computing (HPC) needs of the defense Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) communities.  The purpose of the PETTT Program is to enable the flow of computational science and related technology and help fulfill the research and development objectives of the DoD high performance computing user community.  PETTT will focus on enhancing user productivity through technology transition, training and support.  The predecessor contract of the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) activity has introduced tools and techniques from various computational communities and brokered collaborative activities with government agencies, industry, and academia.  The PETTT activity under this solicitation will further facilitate collaborations among DoD researchers and world-class institutions on computational problems of significant interest for national defense.  The Government anticipates the following solicitation approach for the PETTT contract: (1) this RFI, (2) a pre-proposal Bidders Response identifying a technical/management approach based on the SOO, and (3) a formal Technical/Management and Cost Proposal based on a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government will hold one-on-one bidders conferences with prospective bidders during the pre-proposal phase as well as the RFP phase.  Based on the bidders responses and the bidders conference during the pre-proposal phase, the Government will generate a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  This, together with the SOO will dictate the Governments requirements for PETTT and form the basis for a formal request for proposals (RFP) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates awarding a single Award Fee contract with a Base and four option periods. The Government envisions that the most productive form of the contract will result from a consortium of university and industry partners.  The expected award date is May 2009.  This is a Request for Information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this posting.

Reference: NCI-80090-NG on all correspondence. 

Period of Performance shall be 12 months from date of award time with 4 One Year Options. 

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Office of Market Research and Evaluation (OMRE) at NCI implements about 50 user-centered design research projects each year. Recently, OMRE has included eye tracking as one of the research methods used to conduct formative and evaluation research. With eye tracking, a participant sits in front of a monitor (that looks like a desktop computer) and is asked to review whatever images are projected on the screen (e.g., a website such as www.cancer.gov).  The eye tracking hardware has low-infrared (similar to sunlight) light systems built into it that reflects off of participants pupils back to the device; this allows the device software to translate that information into a visual tracking of where the participants eyes look on the screen even if they are not aware they are looking there. The eye tracking system tells us data about the design of a communication tool (website, brochure, web tool etc.) that cannot be derived any other way.
Value-added Research Functions
Currently, the user-centered design research performed at OMRE involves asking participants to look at designs and computer mock-ups and reporting back to us what sections, items, and components of the tools they believed to be important and relevant to their task at hand (e.g., in looking at www.cancer.gov homepage, participants might be asked where they first looked, why, what areas were most helpful to them, etc.).  The data collected, though valuable, are limited in that they are reflective of a self-report of what the participant remembers and perceives.  An eye tracker would allow us to triangulate the current research methods used in OMRE and provide richer, more quantifiable data that are not reliant on participants self-reports to aid the developers of web images and tools.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501(a)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply. 

 No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.  

Justification 

Tobii Technology is the only entity who provides an eye tracking hardware/software package capable of meeting all requirements needed.  No other vendor offers a product with all the key requirements or salient characteristics. 

Tobii Technology, founded in 2001 is an international leader in the field of eye tracking and eye control. The innovative technology development has revolutionized eye tracking by making it plug-and-play, fully automatic and easy to use and widely used within the scientific community and in commercial market research and usability industry. 

Tobii Technology main company focus is on eye tracking hardware and software that enables people with disabilities to interact with a computing device using only their eyes. There are no peripheral hardware requirements for communicating with the device: all that is needed are eyes. 

Utilizing this product will provide OMRE an objective insight into NCIs consumer attention and effectiveness of NCIs print advertising, TV commercials, product packaging, and online marketing. The concept of eye tracking technology in the marketing and usability industry, especially for NCI is to pre-test and analyze website data gain useful data and draw conclusions around what works or doesnt work the electronic communication media.

Each eye tracker session allows a large number of stimuli to be selected to help facilitate testing.  The stimuli can be presented to the viewer randomly, but all at the same time. Having the flexibility to use one or more stimuli could give great comparative data examining when a webpage is too busy and annoying or perfectly pleasing. Almost everything that OMRE staff members need to know about specific stimuli is included, which saves time and money on development.

We are requesting a sole source purchase from Tobii Technology, Inc. of their Tobii T60 Eyetracker system (primary tracking component), which includes the eyegaze-tracking device and camera built into the display as well as the accompanying Tobii Studio Enterprise software. Unlike Tobii, other like-products are physically intrusive to the participants where the device is either head-mounted or placed on a table directly in front of the participants (see links above for photos).  The Tobii equipment is built into the hardware and simply resembles a computer monitor.

Specifications of instrumentation needed:

	REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION
A.	Key Requirements  
1.	Eye tracking system/technology must be integrated with a 17 TFT display with resolution up to 1280x1024 pixels

2.	Must have an integrated user camera which is invisible to subjects.
3	Must allow head movement of at least 44 x 20 x 30 cm at 60cm from tracker.
4.	Must automatically optimize for bright pupil and dark pupil response subjects
5.	System must allow export of data to SPSS, Matlab
6.	Customize the content of the analysis by placing notes or areas of interest markings throughout the recorded analysis. This feature can be used to post information such as facial expressions, mouse clicks, etc. related to a given session

<DESC>-This is an amendment to the original announcement.  See the changes in ALL CAPS.
- General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for firms having the capability to perform the work described below. This solicitation will be issued electronically, on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF, Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format, and drawings will be available in TIFF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent.
- Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is an on-line system that is located on the Internet. Prior to ORCA, vendors were required to submit Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) for each individual large purchase contract award. Now, using ORCA, a contractor can enter their Reps and Certs information once for use on all Federal contracts. This site not only benefits the contractor by allowing them to maintain an accurate and complete record but also the Contracting Officer as they can view every record, including archives, with the click of a mouse. The ORCA site can be found by going to http://www.bpn.gov and clicking on "Online Reps and Certs Application" on the left side of the screen. If you do not have access to the Internet or feel you need extra Internet help please contact the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) (www.dla.mil/db/procurem.htm) closest to you.  You are strongly encouraged to register in ORCA in responding to this solicitation. You are required to have an active registration in CCR in order to conduct business with the Federal Government.
- Proposed Issue Date: June 16, 2008
- Title of Project:  Land Restoration and Land Clearing
- Description:  The work of this contract will restore formerly developed areas of Everglades National Park. Over 7,000 acres of Everglades National Park consists of formerly developed land that was once farmed, graded and filled for roads or filled for some other purpose. Local agricultural practices included rock plowing, which breaks up underlying bedrock and dramatically alters soil structure. Agricultural fields were often heavily fertilized, resulting in nutrient rich soils, not at all typical of the very nutrient-poor Everglades. In south Florida, previously farmed or filled areas rapidly fill up with dense communities of exotic plants. The drained, artificially nutrient-enriched soils on these sites support such luxuriant plant growth that management of exotics in these areas is impractical. The park has developed techniques for restoring former agricultural or filled sites that restore natural conditions, promote native vegetation communities and minimize the need for ongoing exotic plant control. Over 3000 acres of previously farmed land in the Hole-in-the-Donut area of the park has already been successfully restored using these techniques. Many of the additional areas to be restored are in the East Everglades addition lands, though others are scattered throughout the park. In all, the project would complete the restoration of over 7,000 acres of highly disturbed land and improve the habitat quality and wetland function of a large area surrounding the restoration project.
- Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) service contract with one base year and four option years will be considered for award requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
- Estimated annual price range: $2 million minimum and $24 million maximum.
- Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
- THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SETASIDE.  All responsible small business sources may submit an offer that will be considered.
- It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.
-SUBCONTRACTING PLANS WILL NOT BE REQUIRED.

This RFI provided a brief overview of the program, made draft technical documentation available via request from current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors, and requested written feedback from Industry in a number of areas related to the upcoming acquisition.

A DRAFT Solicitation will be posted to the NAVAIR solicitation website at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations on or about 04 June 2008.

Except as noted here, the Government will only release the draft solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet.

As such, they will not be posted with the RFP.

Upon verification of your status and acknowledgement, the requested documents will be provided.

Prior to release of any control documents under this solicitation, any U.S. contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations.  Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractors responsibility under the US Export laws and regulations, the requested attachments will be provided.  

No telephone requests for the attachments will be accepted.  No written requests, other than requests for the controlled DRAFT Performance Specification, DRAFT Statement of Work and Industry Day will be accepted.  The Government welcomes any preliminary comments and recommendations in regard to the DRAFT Solicitation and DRAFT Performance Specification.  All final comments and recommendations should be submitted by 23 June 2008, 3:00 PM EST.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  Registration in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information on the CCR.  Refer to the CCR website at http://ccr.gov/index.cfm.

<DESC>1. OBJECTIVE & SCOPE

1.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of a centralized geocoding platform (service and/or system) which will best serve the broad geocoding needs of the Department and its component agencies. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit innovative and efficient geocoding methodologies that provide the GMO with insight into the current state of the art both from a data content and system perspective. The information collected will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for any enterprise geocoding solution the Department may wish to develop in the future.  

1.2 BACKGROUND
The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize DHSs return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO has developed a geospatial solutions architecture, the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), which is the technology target for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized geocoding solution that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Departments enforcement, preparedness, response, recovery mission areas.    

1.3 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS
At present there are approximately 15 known geocoding engines servicing various system requirements within DHS. In this current environment, each geocoding engine and their associated reference layers are maintained by a variety of technology, data, staff and other ongoing operations and maintenance infrastructure. Additionally the amount and availability of geocoding functionality from these various geocoding services is largely inaccessible to the broader end users. These current disparate configurations also hinder the ability for remote staff to access geocoding services in a manner that is timely and efficient. 

1.4 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS
The future geocoding environment for DHS will be consolidated to a single solution that supports Department-wide geocoding operations. This fully integrated solution, will help to minimize overall levels of IT investment, enhance overall service delivery, and will be implemented in one of DHSs two data warehouses. Although this more centralized environment will likely exist within an infrastructure controlled and managed by the government, it should also be able to leverage distributed services for certain aspects of desired functionality and/or take advantage of a vendor supplied service delivery that might be cost prohibitive for the government to implement or would offer the desired levels of dynamic failover to a redundant service. Centralizing DHSs geocoding requirements also meets the intent of DHS Management Objective 4030, and the Departments Investment Portfolio Management Program.  

This future geocoding solution will support DHS business processes in the areas of:

Ad hoc street address matching to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

Batch processing of street addresses to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

Address validation, certification, correction, and other interpolative capabilities

Methods of determining and matching the location of landmarks, cities, towns, and other commonly-used geographic references (i.e. Gazetteer level functionality)

Proximal intelligence or supplemental detail on environs of geocoded results beyond simple latitude and longitude returns (i.e. demographics, political boundaries, census designation, Congressional Districts etc)

Ability to load and manage custom taxonomies, data dictionaries and GIS datasets.

Reverse geocoding capabilities to translate incoming coordinate data and dimensionalize that geo-location data to a local street address, nearest populated place etc... 

While serving the businesses processes described above are of immediate interest to the Department and the majority of its mission owners and operators, it is conceivable that a future state of operations may also optionally contain a capability to search text documents using various geographic keywords and display that information geographically on a map interface.   

This future geocoding environment will be implemented in such a way as to support the broadest end users possible, the following DHS components are specifically in scope for this desired implementation given known requirements and existing mission needs:

Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE)
Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
U.S. Secret Service (USSS)
National Operations Center (NOC)
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)

Anticipated volume/usage metrics:

The estimated monthly volume of ad hoc geocoding requests. .   500,000
The estimated monthly volume of batch geocoding requests... 1,000,000
The estimated monthly volume of unstructured (gazetteer) requests. 20,000,000	

Characteristics of the future solution may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:

Systems provisioned via service oriented architectures/automation interfaces,
Systems hosted and maintained by solution provider outside DHS firewalls,
Systems hosted and maintained by DHS within its firewalls,
Systems that provide graphical user interfaces

viii.  DHS Use Case Scenarios
In addition to describing the system/architectural elements of their solution(s), respondents should also outline how end users would specifically interact with their proposed solution(s) in the following use case scenarios:

 Batch Geocoding Use Case:
A program analyst has recently received a comma delimited export file from an existing DHS mission critical application. This file contains several hundred thousand to several million addresses which needs to be geocoded in a batch process to support follow on analysis. Some of these records share a single street address (i.e. commercial office or high rise apartment building). Any address which is not directly matched to a particular reference data set should be re-geocoded using multiple reference data sources to reconcile address mismatches. Assuming this analyst has access to the DHS intranet as well as the outside internet, please describe how this end user would interact with the proposed solution to achieve a geocoding match rate above 85% 

 Gazetteer Level Functionality: 
A variety of DHS mission domains require access to a rapid map display functionality based on simple keyword searches for purposes of geolocation and to better orient themselves to a particular area of interest quickly. Typical keyword searches used might include:

 Exact/Partial Street Address
 City/Neighborhood/County Name
 Landmark Alias (i.e Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge etc)

For example, a good Samaritan observes a signal flare from the 3rd floor of his beach front hotel and telephones in to a local US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) operations center. During the call the SAR controller must rapidly translate that observer and observed information to a corresponding Latitude/Longitude, in order to best vector USCG assets to aid those in distress. Please describe how the proposed geocoding solution(s) might support this potential call center application and provide a flexible gazetteer level functionality to both DHS end users with and without outside internet connectivity.

 Ad-hoc Interactive Geocoding from a GIS Enabled Desktop Workstation
Describe how the proposed solution(s) could support a geospatial analyst using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software application to support geocoding in an ad hoc or interactive way. Respondents should describe in detail how the proposed solution leverages both existing COTS GIS functionality and any proposed plug-ins, additional applications, and/or toolbar(s) to support accurate and efficient geocoding. Respondents may assume the geospatial analyst has access to both the DHS intranet and the wider internet.

 Geo-Entity Extraction from a Structured/Unstructured Text
Please describe how the proposed solution(s) might support a geographic keyword search across a variety of text based documents, messages, and/or reports and then display the results in a geographic context on a map display to better inform analysis and/or decision making.

4.2 Questions Received as of 6/12/08

Question 3: 
I would like clarification on several requirements listed in the RFI:
Custom/Supplemental Address Dictionaries or Taxonomies for Gazetteer Functionality  Clarification of the meaning of this requirement

Response 3:
Certain DHS components may have individual requirements to leverage customized or colloquial address dictionaries as supplemental resources to also reference a particular location, sector, neighborhood, and/or place of interest. These data reference sources are expected to be in addition to more known reference data to support a geocoding system(s), such as those developed toward postal addressing standards. Respondents should describe if (and how) additional address/location dictionaries could be supported by their proposed solution.  

Question 4:
I would like clarification on several requirements listed in the RFI:
Business Rules, Heuristic Fallback Options, Sensitivity, Conflict Resolution - Clarification of the meaning of this requirement

Response 4:
Respondents should describe how their proposed solution manages address/location verification and what rule(s) base is used to determine an exact geocode. In the event location matches are not exact, respondents should further describe the heuristic methodology by which alternate match candidates can be determined.  Where applicable, respondents should also describe how the heuristic methodology used for determining alternate match candidate(s) can be further refined or tuned.

Question 5:
I would like clarification on several requirements listed in the RFI:
Adaptability/Compliance with Existing DHS IT Policy/Systems  Can the IT Policy/System be downloaded?

The Offeror must provide a list of three contracts that it is currently performing or has completed within the past three years and that the Contractor considers the most relevant in demonstrating its ability to perform the proposed effort.  Include the following for each contract: Contracting Officer's Name, Contracting Officer's Agency/Firm and Address, Contracting Officer's Telephone Number, Contract Number, Description of the Work performed under the contract, Task Order Number, Period of Performance, and Total Contract Value.  The Offeror will be given an opportunity to respond to any negative past performance information received. If no response is received within the specified timeframe, the negative past performance information will be evaluated as submitted.  If the Offeror has no relevant past performance history, it must affirmatively so state.
