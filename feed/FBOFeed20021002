<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), are collaborating on the subject Broad Agency Announcement.  The NIAID and NCRR encourages the submission of grant applications and/or contract proposals for the establishment of Regional and National Biocontainment Laboratories, respectively, in order to further the research capabilities of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), NIAID, to conduct research on Category A, B, and C priority pathogens that are considered to be of significant research importance. The list of pathogens is provided at the following weblink: (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/bandc_priority.htm).  Only domestic (U.S.), non-Federal, public or private non-profit organizations that support biomedical research are eligible to apply.  Awards under this program are contingent on availability of appropriated funds and NIAID appropriations authority provided at the discretion of Congress.  In February of 2002, the NIAID developed a strategic plan for biodefense research in consultation with a Blue Ribbon Panel to accomplish short- and long-term goals aimed at protection of the United States and the world population against attacks by these agents.  The NIAID strategic plan emphasizes both basic research and the application of the basic research to the development of products such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.  The Biocontainment Laboratories being solicited through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be an integral part of the biodefense research agenda of the NIAID.  This BAA will consist of two parts:  Part A - Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) to be awarded as grants and Part B - National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) to be awarded as contracts.  PART A - RBLs:  The overall planned objective of the RBL construction program is to provide funding to design, build, renovate, certify and install fixed equipment into state-of-the-art BSL-3 biocontainment laboratories and the necessary associated BSL-2 labs, animal facilities, and research support space.   RBLs will be required to preferentially support the research activities of NIAID Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE), as well as other NIAID funded biodefense and emerging infectious diseases research.  RBLs will be part of the NIAID RCE Biodefense Network and will serve as a regional resource for research institutions in the region.  In addition, RBLs will be required to be available and prepared to assist national, state, and local public health efforts in the event of a bioterrorism emergency.  PART B - NBLs:  The overall objective of the NBL construction program is to provide funding to design, build, and certify comprehensive, state-of-the-art BSL-4 biocontainment laboratories and the necessary associated BSL-3 labs, BSL-2 labs, animal facilities, and research support space. NBLs will serve as a national resource for efforts in conducting clinical and laboratory (in vitro and in vivo) research and testing on hazardous biological agents in support of the NIAID?s Biodefense Agenda.  NBLs will be required to preferentially support the research activities of NIAID Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE), as well as other NIAID funded biodefense research.  NBLs will be part of the NIAID RCE Biodefense Network and will serve as a national resource for research.  In addition, NBLs must be available and prepared to assist national, state, and local public health efforts in the event of a bioterrorism emergency.   BAA-NIH-NIAID-NCRR-DMID-03-36 will be available electronically on or about October 15, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) home page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This announcement does not commit the Government to make an award.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Gary Reckeweg, (732) 427-1346
<DESC>NA BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA): DAAB)&-03-R-L402,  LOW REFLECTIVITY UNCOOLED CAMERA SYSTEM Due: December 6, 2002	Contracts POC: Andrew Dellomo, CECOM Ft. Monmouth, NJ, 732-532-3569, Andrew.Dellomo@mail1.monmouth.army.mil Technical POC: Mr. Byong Ahn, CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Ft. Belvoir, VA, 703-704-2031, byong.ahn@nvl.army.mil The US Army CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate is issuing this BAA to solicit proposals for a program to reduce the reflectivity of the uncooled far-infrared (7 - 12 mm spectral band) focal plane arrays (FPAs) of 640 by 480 elements with  a pixel size of less than 30 micrometer, and fabricate a brassboard uncooled IR camera with the improved/modified FPA and which may include external optics and electronics to meet the low reflectivity requirements.   This is a two-phase program. The period for Phase 1 is 24 months, and the period for Phase 2 is 18 months. The funding available for this BAA is $1.6 M.  In Phase 1, the contractors are to measure and analyze the sources of the high reflection from the existing uncooled FPAs, and/or develop the means to reduce the reflection.  For the FPA manufacturers, they are to develop the means to reduce the reflection by, for example, increasing the absorption of the detector elements, increasing the fill-factor of the detector pixels, covering the highly reflective components or using oth er means. Contractors can use FPAs whose sizes are other than the 640 x 480 elements, but with the same structures as the 640 x 480 elements for the study purpose, if they can show the equivalency of the effort. The contractors will make several designs of  engineering lots and make measurements to assess their effort to accomplish the above technical objectives.  For the non-FPA manufacturers, they are to design and develop external optics and other means to reduce the reflection from the FPA without analyzing the sources of the reflection from the existing FPAs.  In Phase 1, the government may decide to discontinue funding particular contractors if the progress is not satisfactory.  In Phase 2, one or two contractors from Phase 1 will be selected to fabricate a brassboard uncooled IR camera or brassboard uncooled IR cameras to include the techniques developed in Phase 1. These may include the improved FPAs, the external optics, and th e electronic components. The size of the FPA for the brassboard camera shall be 640 x 480 elements. The first camera to be built will be mainly an effort to integrate the components. The second effort will be an effort to optimize the camera in weight, siz e, and cost. The contractors are encouraged to submit two-phase proposals, but Phase 2 efforts may be solicited through a competitive follow-on BAA.

A - BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT:  NAVAL AIR VEHICLE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY - *BAA NO. 01-00.  POC, Naval Air Systems Command, Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, (AIR 4.4T), 22195 Elmer Road, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534 .
Broad Agency Announcement: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T) is interested in receiving proposals for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles.  Specifically needed is 1) research for advanced gas turbine propulsion component and materials technologies for Fighter/Attack Aircraft Engines, Patrol/Surveillence and Rotary Wing Aircraft Engines, Missile and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Uninhabited Combat Air vehicles (UCAV) Engines. The performance, life, and cost goals for these research efforts shall be consistent with the DOD/NASA Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) Initiative and Versatile Advanced Affordable Turbine Engines (VAATE) Initiative, and the Tri-Service Reliance Science & Technology and Joint Directors of Laboratories Aeropropulsion Sub-Panel Joint Service Program Plans. Other topics include development of Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Navy propulsion component and subsystem technologies applicable to fleet engines and near term upgrades/derivative engines which reduce fuel consumption; development of Advanced Electrical Power and Thermal Management technologies; Innovative concepts that facilitate integration of expendable turbo-ramjets into cruise missile airframes; Assessment of Potential Costs and Benefits Of +100 Additives to Naval Aviation,  Assessment Of Potential Benefits Of  Additives Specifically To Reduce Emissions of Naval Aircraft, and Development of a Contaminated Fuel Detector for Navy Aircraft Refueling Operations.

Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication ?Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Year 2003?. The aforementioned guide can be found at:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/solicitation_view_action.cfm?Sol_No=N00421-02-R-0297

Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D) (2). 

 This announcement will be open for one year after it appears in the Fed Biz Opp?s (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).  Initial Proposals and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. Initial proposals (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism.  No further criteria will be used in the evaluation.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds.  Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated.   Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Since many aspects of the IHPTET/VAATE initiative are classified, the offerors and their personnel may need to possess security clearances up to and including the secret level for contracts associated with IHPTET/VAATE, contemplated under this announcement.  Specific reporting (DD1423) requirements shall be specified within each contract award.   At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report.  Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals (IPs) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate.  BRIEFNESS IS DESIBRABLE - IPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.  Cost estimates in IPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged.  Offerors of those IPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.  An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award.  One original and three copies of each IP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted.  IPs and Proposals shall be submitted to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regards to this requirement.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Dis-Advantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.  Note:  Only the Contracting Officer is authorized to award government contracts.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source contract to Shelby Specialty Glove (SSG) for the procurement of 11,150 Steam Block Gloves.  The Firewall Steam Block Gloves were specially designed and developed for shipboard firefighting.  The Firewall Steam Block shield adds a thermal barrier to the gloves back, giving more protection against steam burns.   The Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility (NCTRF) reviewed all the requirements and concluded that all shipboard firefighters are required to have thermal and steam protection.   The gloves manufactured by SSG are currently the only glove that provides this combined level of protection. Only those articles that have been successfully tested are qualified.  The objective of this process is to verify that the damage control equipment provide s acceptable levels of safety throughout the specified operating range when approved operating and maintenance procedures are followed.  The intent of the process is to provide maximum reasonable assurance that an accident will not occur and establishes maximum reasonable assurance that the user may be recovered without injury if there is an accident. The reason this acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition is because Shelby Specialty Glove is the only company that has been qualified by NCTRF to provide the Steam Block Gloves. Other sources interested in qualifying their products may contact the NCTRF, Harry Winer, phone (508) 233-4420 ext.218 or Mr. Richard Wojtaszek, phone (508) 233-4420 ext.219.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for two (2) pasture facilities to maintain wild horses.  The facilities must be located in one of the following states:  Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri or Iowa.  The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:  BACKGROUND - a.  Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by BLM and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the December 15, 1971 Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331-1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain two (2) facilities, one to initially pasture a maximum of 2,000 (plus or minus) mares and another to initially pasture a maximum of 2,000 (plus or minus) geldings.  b.  The BLM started the implementation of the Wild Horse and Burro program's strategic plan "Living Legends in Balance with the Land."  This plan will be removing more animals than the BLM has facility space to maintain and continuing to gather animals to active Approbate Management Levels on the Public Lands.  During the first years of this contract, the majority of the horses will be younger, adoptable animals.  These animals will be received and shipped from the facility year round.  Because of the large number of animals being removed from public lands, there is an excess of adoptable animals.  These animals will be kept in a pasture setting while they are maintained at this facility.  All stallions over the age of 6 years will be gelded and the younger stallions will not be gelded.  c.  Older horses may be shipped into the facility during the first years, but will be increasing as the contract continues.  The horses maintained for long term will be a non-reproductive herd consisting primarily of older horses in the age range of 6-30 years old.  d.  One contract will hold geldings and one will hold mares.  For the long-term holding, all the stallions will be gelded and there should be no stallions in the herd.  For the mares long-term holding, some of the mares may be in foal.  All foals will be removed from the facility after they are weaned.  As horses die, they may not be replaced with additional horses.  Therefore, the number of horses may decline during the period of the contracts.  OBJECTIVES - a.  To maintain excess wild horses on private land in pastures that are large enough to allow free-roaming behavior and can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in ggod condition.   b.  In the long-term holding, to minimize to the extent possible handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals.  c.  To provide pasture and semi-free roaming behavior in the younger, more adoptable animals, until they are shipped to an adoption.  d.  To provide humane care during receiving, holding, preparing and shipment of horses.  e.  To provide regular on-the-ground observation of the wild horses to ascertain their well being and safety.  f.  To provide management by individuals that are knowledgeable and experienced with regards to the behavior and nutritional requirements of equine and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desireable forage plants.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210.  This solicitation will be available on or about October 11, 2002.  Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation in writing only.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>R--Enhancement to SAVES Electonic Handbook (EHB)
<SOLNBR>NBCW3Z00035
<RESPDATE>110102
<ARCHDATE>10022003
<CONTACT>Karen A.  Brooks Contracting Officer 2022083426     Karen_A_Brooks@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior intends to sole source to REI Systems, Inc., 7620 Little River Turnpike, Suite 500, Annandale, VA  22003.  INTRODUCTION:  This document defines the scope of work, with deliverables, to be accomplished by the Contractor for the Department of the Interior (DOI). It details the specific tasks necessary to enhance the Screening Available and Exchange Sale (SAVES) Electronic Handbook. The SAVES Electronic Handbook was developed under a contract issued by the National Business Center Contracting Office at the request of the National Business Center - Reston (then known as the Washington Administrative Service Center).  This will be a fixed price contract.  PROJECT SCOPE:  The Contractor will provide a complete and tested enhancement to the SAVES Electronic Handbook to the DOI.  The project will include three stages.  Each stage will have specific deliverables.  The stages are: 1) Create Enhancement Requirements, 2) Implement Enhancement Process(es), and 3) Deployment of the Enhancement into the existing SAVES Electronic Handbook.  Since the first stage of the project will create the Enhancement requirements definition for use in the actual development of the finished product this SOW will not attempt to define the requirements of the enhancement.  Background information and an overview of what the system will be expected to do follows:  Background:  REI Systems, Inc. developed the existing SAVES Electronic Handbook (EHB).  It automates screening and reporting of disposable property among the DOI Bureaus and Offices for re-use within the DOI.   Additionally, the SAVES EHB automates reporting of excess and exchange-sale personal property to the General Services Administration (GSA).  The system: -  reduces the time and effort required to track disposal of personal property as it goes through the available, excess and surplus stages - maximizes reutilization of available/excess personal property by widespread dissemination of information about available property and by providing an easy to use interface to screen and freeze available property for reutilization - provides an interface for procurement personnel to easily screen available/excess personal property for acquisition reviews General Description of the Enhancement The existing SAVES EHB advertises available personal property and reports excess personal property to the GSA, but does not record the disposition of the property after it leaves the accountable office.  The enhancement to the SAVES EHB will complete the disposal automation by providing records of the disposition of personal property items. The disposition of DOI property, whether reported as available or declared unserviceable, obsolete or lost/destroyed, is input into a disposal record and maintained by Fiscal Year.  The following explains the uses and purposes of maintaining a disposal record: - generates reports for financial and property managers that provide information about general ledger adjustments for capitalized property and provide information about any proceeds resulting from disposition of surplus property - generates reports required to satisfy federal regulations such as the Report of Excess Personal Property and the Annual Report of Property Donated to non-Federal Recipients, and Report of Survey disposal methods for property managers to monitor the various disposal activities within their respective Bureaus and the Department to obtain required reports without requesting the information from each Bureau or Office and compiling separate reports. - record various disposal actions and authorities to dispose of Government personal property for audit purposes. A SAVES EHB disposal screen will be developed with required data fields to record the required disposal information.  Disposal methods will have specific codes for generating reports by various disposal methods.  The disposal of property items that have been reported through the system as available and/or excess will be closed out by the final disposal entry. Property items not reported through the system as available and/or excess will be entered into the disposal side, only. Disposal actions will remain in a data file for three Fiscal Years-the current Fiscal Year and previous two fiscal years.  Disposal actions three fiscal years back and older will be archived in an ASCII file format and stored on a disk.  If necessary, this data can be retrieved and used. VENDOR RESPONSIBILITIES Stage 1 - Develop Requirements for the Enhancement  Work with a team of DOI representatives familiar with the existing SAVES property disposal process to document the steps and activities necessary for enhancing it to accomplish actions necessary to finish the disposal automation process by providing records of the disposition of personal property items Develop, review, and revise the Electronic Handbook to accurately reflect the process steps and the actions and forms required to perform the steps - this development will occur using Contractor resources Assess DOI's current hardware/software environment and recommend any additional resources required to implement the electronic handbook Develop an implementation schedule for the Enhancement Stage 2 Document changes necessary to existing databases and implement the forms required to support the additional process steps of the Enhanced Electronic Handbook.  Database modifications must be coordinated with the DOI - NBC Data Base Administrator (DBA). Demonstrate the Electronic Handbook's enhanced functionality to DOI personnel and make whatever modifications are needed based upon user and/or DBA feedback. Perform testing of all portions of the electronic handbook, including the enhanced portions, to ensure that the product to be delivered is error free.  Involve DOI functional personnel in testing of product prior to deployment. Stage 3 Deliver and install the Enhanced Electronic Handbook on the NBC - DOI Server DOI RESPONSIBILITIES Assign a cadre of DOI personnel, functional (BLM) and technical (NBC), to assist the vendor in the development of the Enhancement's requirements over the period covered by Stage 1. Ensure that all of the regulations, statutes, laws, processes, forms, activities, legacy system interfaces, etc. are defined to the vendor so that the system will respond to each area appropriately. Participate in testing of the product prior to deployment. Provide space for the vendor to work while collecting the information necessary to build the Electronic Handbook - computer resources will be provided by the vendor (access to the Internet will be required at the location that the vendor is supplied). DELIVERABLES Stage 1 Documentation of all modifications necessary to implement the Enhancement's  process steps and associated actions.  This documentation must be detailed enough to provide the DOI with the ability to review the processes to determine that all of the necessary steps and associated actions are present. This stage will be completed one (1) month following contract award and a mutually agreeable start date being arranged. Stage 2 Development of an Enhanced Electronic Handbook encompassing support for processing all of the additional SAVES steps detailed in Stage 1 documentation.  This electronic handbook must be demonstrated to DOI personnel prior to delivery for verification that all processes and actions anticipated are included. This stage will be completed two (2) months following completion of Stage 1 Stage 3 Deployment of the Enhanced SAVES Electronic Handbook onto the DOI server. Documentation of the system as built must be provided in either hard copy or in an Electronic Handbook.  The documentation must be detailed enough to allow NBC - DOI personnel to make modifications to the delivered system without assistance from the Contractor.  This stage will be completed two 2 months following completion of Stage 2. ADMINISTRATION The contractor will submit an invoice once each stage is accepted by the Government.  Acceptance will be conveyed to the Contractor via Email.   Each invoice should indicate the Stage for which the invoice applies.   The contractor will be notified, by the DOI-NBC personnel, via Email, when to initiate stages 2 and 3.  Stage 1 will be initiated after contract award at a mutually agreeable date, but not longer than one month after contract award.  The Contractor will take technical direction from the NBC-DOI's Technical Support Branch. The period of performance is from date of awad through 9/30/2003.  This is a 100% total small business set-aside.  No solicitation document exists.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  See Numbered Note 22.

<RESPDATE>102102
<ARCHDATE>04212003
<CONTACT>Ms. Grace K. Fontana (781)377-3384, grace.Fontana@hanscom.af.mil.
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. In April 2002, the Air Force Director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (USAF/XOI) initiated an effort to modernize the Air Force's precise positioning capabilities.  Precise positioning is the process of accurately locating a point relative to the Earth's surface and deriving latitude, longitude, and elevation information.  The precise positioning process is a key prerequisite for the employment of precision-guided munitions (PGMs).  The goal of the Air Force modernization effort is to dramatically increase the speed and accuracy of the precise positioning process to support the fielding of the next generation of precision munitions. As part of this effort, the Air Force Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC/INO) is seeking white papers and industry concepts from contractors regarding existing capabilities and emerging technologies that would contribute to achieving the Air Force precise positioning modernization goals. Of particular interest is information and concepts for automated registration of national and tactical imagery to NIMA's Digital Point Positioning Database and other national imagery products to support derivation of Coordinate Seeking Weapon (CSW) quality target coordinates within single digit minutes of image receipt. Objective capabilities will support the development of a workstation application that could be seamlessly integrated into the Air Force's existing Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) and Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) system architectures and generate precise geo-coordinates and confidences data (error estimates) using national technical means, U-2, RQ-1 Predator, and RQ-4 Global Hawk imagery sensors. Companies with an existing capability or emerging technology that would contribute to achieving the Air Force precise positioning modernization goals are encouraged to respond.  Your response should provide a description of the capabilities as well as a description of how the concept could be implemented within the Air Force to achieve or exceed the Air Force's objectives. Respondents to this RFI should identify their company name, address, email, telephone number and a POC.  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.  Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.  Please provide the requested information not later than 21 October 2002.  This is an RFI only and all information received will be for planning purposes only. Interested respondents having questions with respect to the information requested in the RFI should direct them to Ms. Grace K. Fontana (781) 377-3384, grace.Fontana@hanscom.af.mil. Please provide the requested information not later than COB 21 October 2002.  Facsimile (202) 767-6048 or e-mail john.burkert@langley.af.mil responses are acceptable.  Otherwise mail responses to: AFC2ISRC/INOT, 240 Luke Ave., Bldg 1304, Rm 202, Bolling AFB, Washington DC, 20332, Attn: Mr. John Burkert. A copy of your response should be forwarded to ESC/SRK, Attn: Ms. Grace K.

Corley, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from respondents or potential respondents during RFI development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer. The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate RFI's or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106 or email at Jerry.Corley@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Questions concerning Refuse and Recycling:


1) Would the base consider making a separate CLINS for disposal/tonnage? Yes 

2) Are the 8 yard front load containers on base owned by the base or by Selrico? Selrico 

3) A lot of the cans are in bad shape.  You know, paint is bleached out and bottoms are rotted out or lids are damaged.  Who is responsible for maintaining these units.   Contractor is responsible. 

4) The conveyor is owned by the base.  It is very bad condition.  Who is responsible for maintenance?  Starting 1 Oct, contractor will be owner of conveyor & responsible for maintenance.  In it's current condition, it might be cheaper to lease and/or buy a new one? Contractor's decision. 

5) Why the big drop in the amount of material to be recycled?  Disposal is very high. After many years of paying a contractor to sort 70-80% of our refuse, those materials, which have historically not sold or been re-used have been excluded from sorting, recycling, processing, and marketing; and will go directly to the landfill. 

6) Appendix A for the SOW for Refuse and for Recycling are identical.  Is it intended to have the same containers used for recycling and for refuse? Yes 

7) Is it the intent of the SOW to have the contractor collect sorted recyclables from each office facility?  Yes, from each building or building compound area. If so, what containers are being specified for the task? It is up to the contractor to decide "how, when, & with what" refuse and recyclables will be collected.  Current locations for collection stations on base will accommodate 1 or 2 standard refuse dumpsters. Typically one dumpster has been labeled for "refuse" and one for "recyclables." 

8) In paragraph 1.5.6.2. It states that multi-compartmental containers should be used.  (It is up to the contractor to decide if he will use or not use multi-compartmental containers.)  What size are the containers, when will these containers be collected (the contractor must submit a collection schedule for the contracting officer's approval. The schedule must adequately address volumes of refuse and recyclables to be collected on a weekly basis), how many containers are required (up to the contractor to decide on size of containers which will in turn determine how many containers are needed), and where
will the containers be located? (up to the contractor to determine & obtain contracting officer's approval for location of collection stations.) 
GENERAL RESPONSE to questions above: For non-MFH areas, historically there have been approximately 150 dumpsters, 8 cu yds each placed at approximately 130 locations; collection schedule for 75% of these locations or collection stations have been serviced twice a week; 15% require 3 times per week, and the remaining 10% require weekly pick-up. For MFH areas, historically there have been two containers per MFH resident/unit; neither larger than 85 gallons; one designated for refuse and the other for recyclables. 

9) In regard to the in-vessel composter: Who is responsible for the cost of maintaining the composter? The contractor will perform routine & scheduled maintenance checks. Cost of repairs will be paid by the Government provided the contractor obtained CO approval prior to initiating repairs.   What is done with the compost from the composter?  Contractor transports to Recycling Center for sale and/or re-use. How often is it emptied?  Typically every other day.  Are there scales provided to weigh in-put and out-put?  No. What happens to the food waste if the composter is broken? Contractor requests CO approval to take to landfill while composter is being repaired. 

10) In paragraph 1.10.2.1. It states the contractor shall provide a drum crusher.  In the Appendix with Government Furnished Equipment the Government supplies one drum crusher.  Can this Government provided drum crusher be utilized for this task or is the contractor required to buy an additional drum crusher? The gov-furniices that meet user?s needs including cost and schedule.

        	Past and Present Performance Information is recent and relevant information regarding a Contractor?s actions under previously awarded contracts.  Recent performance is defined as within the past three (3) years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the performance confidence assessment than less recent performance.  The offeror?s Past and Present Performance will be evaluated to include:  1) the Contractor?s record of conforming to statement of works and the standards in the operation/management of REFUSE AND RECYCLING services,  2) the Contractor?s history of business relations and management of key personnel; 3) the Contractor?s environmental record; 4) the Contractor?s security record; and 5) the Contractor?s ability to perform quality service and minimize customer complaints.  The offeror shall provide references from both Governmental (federal, state, and local) and non-Government sources related to Refuse and Recycling services.  References should be similar in size and scope to this acquisition or greater to be considered applicable to the evaluation.  Relevant information is defined as a contract for Refuse and Recycling services and waste.     

	The offeror shall fully complete the Offeror?s Performance Information Form (Attachment 1) and send the Past Performance Information Form and Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 2) as required in the previous section.  A maximum of ten completed questionnaires will be accepted and evaluated per offeror.

        	Offerors will be given the opportunity to refute any adverse information provided in Past and Present Performance information research (if rebuttal information is not already provided on the form/survey).  The offeror shall limit this rebuttal to addressing the specific negative comments.  The offeror shall clearly distinguish between any rebuttal already provided on a form/survey versus those rebuttals provided for the purposes of this proposal.  The offer may also address relevancy in accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(2).

        	The Government may use Past and Present Performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror(s).  Information obtained by this method will be used for both the responsibility determination and evaluation decision.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant Past and Present Performance or for whom information on Past Performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on Past and Present Performance.

      	Should offerors wish to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the corrective action taken, please submit such information with proposals as well in accordance with FAR 15.305(2).

      	Past and Present Performance evaluation is accomplished through assignment of a confidence assessment rating based on assessing performance risk.  The rating is as follows: 

Definition	Rating
Based on the offeror?s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.	EXCEPTIONALHigh Confidence
Based on the offeror?s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.	VERY GOODSignificant Confidence

<DESC>SECTION  SF 30 BLOCK 14 CONTINUATION PAGE 
 
 
  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 

Changes in Solicitation/Contract/Order Form 

     The required response date/time has changed from 06-Sep-2002 00:00 to 06-Sep-2002 
     12:00
      

 
Changes in Section SF 1449 
 
 
  
The following clauses which are incorporated by full text have been added or modified: 

 
52.212-1      INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2000) 

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52-212-2 EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS JAN 1999 
EVALUATION CRITERIA.
	Section ?E? of the solicitation describes in detail the evaluation process and as such, forms the basis of this plan.  
	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.
		(a)  Past Performance (see FAR 15.304);
		(b)  Price
Past Performance is significantly more important than price.  Offerors do have the ability to submit a letter stating that their company is without any relevant past and present performance information.  In those cases, the offeror will receive a neutral rating.
	Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.
	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

	This is a best value competitive acquisition and is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1, Tradeoff Process.  Award will be made to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR whose proposal conforms to the RFP?s requirements, and is judged to represent the best value to the Government.  The best value is represented by the most advantageous offer.  

	To arrive at a best value decision, the Contracting Officer (CO) will integrate Past and Present Performance Criteria, Price Criteria, and any other solicitation provisions cited in this document.  The CO is the Source Selection Authority  responsible for the final decision to select a contractor.  The CO will conduct the selection using the procedures specified from the revised Air Force Source Selection policies and procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15, DOD FAR Sup, Air Force FAR Sup, and Air Force Appendix DD.  

	The Government evaluation team and the CO will strive for maximum objectivity.  The selection process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgement is implicit throughout the entire process.  The Government intends to select one Contractor for the subject solicitation.  However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal submitted.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.

	EVALUATION CRITERIA AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THEIR ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:

	Past and Present Performance Criteria:

	             Past and Present Performance carries greater weight than Price.  Past and Present Performance is the most important factor in the award decision.  

	             The main purpose of the Past and Present Performance evaluation is to appropriately consider each offerors demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and servshed drum crusher will become the property of the contractor on 1 Oct 02; repair, maintenance, and/or replacement will be at contractor's expense as of 1 Oct 02. 

11) In paragraph 1.5.5.4. It states the contractor shall immediately notify the QAP regarding any DRMO items in the container.  How is the contractor to know if these items are in the container and what are DRMO items?  DRMO is required to notify the contractor & will be required to work closely with the Recycling Center to recover any DOD item(s) that must be processed for sale by DRMO. It is DRMO's responsibility to drop by the Center, educate the recycling manager, and collect DRMO items. There is minimal impact to Recycling Center operations, but there is an occasional item that surfaces at the center. 

12) At the site visit it was stated there are no rolloff containers required for this contract.  In paragraph 1.6.1.2. it states the contractor shall furnish tarped roll off containers.  Are there any historicals in regard to this service?  Used for self-help projects & CE operations such as asbestos abatement.  What size containers are needed?  30 and 40 cu yard  How many containers are needed?  Containers are ordered by contractor, but any charges such as delivery fee, emptying fee, etc. is paid directly to BFI Landfill by the government.  Will this service be a separate CLIN item? No. 

Regarding 8 cy frontload government owned dumpsters.
On August 2, 2002 I inspected government dumpsters, after evaluating their condition it is my opinion they need to be replaced or put on a rigorous refurbishing program.

13) Will government replace dumpsters or contractor provided?   Contractor becomes the owner on 1 Oct 02. 

14) Does government have a maintenance schedule?   Up to contractor to maintain. 

15) Recycle compartmentalized trailers, how many? And locations?   See above. 

16) Government provided Hyster forklift is inoperable therefore should be not included on government provided list of equipment?   Becomes contractor property as of 1 Oct 02.  

17) Other than routine maintenance on government owned equipment will repairs (labor) to equipment be line items?  Effective 1 Oct 02, there will no longer be any government-furnished equipment. 

18) Regarding housing it is my understanding that you are phasing in new housing to be completed by 2005 what will the number of household be at that time?  Same. New housing will replace old housing.

Revised Notice pertaining to A&E Project No. SSA-0802-02-5030.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES to provide architectural/engineering (A/E) design, administration, management and investigation services for the Social Security Administration (SSA).  THIS REQUIREMENT IS SET-ASIDE ONLY FOR A&E FIRMS CERTIFIED UNDER THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 8(a) PROGRAM.

SSA seeks an A/E firm to provide professional services for overall design, project administration, facilities management and multi-discipline (architectural, electrical, mechanical, structural and specialized engineering) support for SSA's nationwide facilities program.  Services are to be order by issuance of task orders under an indefinite quantity contract.

Designated professional services will include but may not be limited to: pre-design, site analysis, schematic design, design development, construction documents, bidding and negotiation, construction contract administration, post-construction and certain non-sequential services such as: special studies, life cycle cost analysis, value analysis, quantity surveys, detailed construction cost estimates, energy studies, environmental monitoring, graphics design, special furnishings design, computer applications, materials and systems testing, photography and videotaping.  Proficiency in the state-of-the art computer software, e-mail, AutoCAD or Microstation is required.

Facilities work will include but not be limited to small office buildings to large sophisticated special use buildings and computer rooms for the latest state-of-the-art computer and people environment.

Consideration will be limited to primary/prime firms with the required disciplines having an existing established office within the Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. geographic area of the SSA Headquarters located in Baltimore, Maryland. The need for close coordination between SSA and the A/E Contractor is essential to the success of the delivery tasks. Telephone coordination alone would be insufficient to ensure the high quality work products.

The selection will be based on the below listed weighted evaluation categories.  More weight will be given in each of the evaluation categories to the prime firm as opposed to the prime?s proposed consultant(s)/subcontractor(s).

1. PROJECT TEAM (25 PERCENT)
This category will be used to evaluate the A-E's proposed key personnel with respect to their qualifications, individual experience, and past experience as team members on similar projects.
A. Evaluate the A/E's proposed team in terms of each member's professional background experience in construction and repair and improvement projects.
1. Evaluate key personnel's educational background and professional registration.
2. Evaluate key personnel's past experience in their technical field.
B. Evaluate the A-E's proposed team in terms of team makeup and interrelationship of technical, management, and production disciplines to meet the program needs.
1. Evaluate key personnel's past experience working as members of a team, more specifically past experience as a member of this proposed team.
2. Evaluate the A/E's rationale for the selection of each member who makes up the team.

2. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT (25 PERCENT)
This category will be used to evaluate the A/E's proposed plan for execution of a task order?s required design/project inspection and production of reports on the basis of team organization, and management and control procedures to accomplish this project.
A. Evaluate the A/E's overall organization in terms of its potential for efficient operation on, and responsiveness to, the needs of task orders.
1. Evaluate the firm's overall organization with a view toward its adaptability for inspection and technical reporting as opposed to only building design.
2. Determine the degree to which the current staffing of the firm and proposed consultant firms wilities to perform the services described herein are invited to respond by submitting two copies each of completed Standard Forms 254 and 255 along with a letter of interest referencing A&E Project No. SSA-0802-02-5030 to be received by the office listed above on or before May 31, 2002.  Standard Form 254 should also be included for all consultants proposed as team members. All forms 254 are considered current if they are not more than one (1) year old from the month of this announcement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The Government will not recognize costs associated with the preparation and submittal of Standard Forms 254 and 255.

<CONTACT>Catherine Hiltner, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 402-3063, Fax (301) 435-8514, Email hiltnerc@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide comprehensive chemical and low-level radioactive waste management services for the NIH campus located in Bethesda, MD as well as approximately 27 off-campus facilities in Maryland.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL.  This is a request for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a capability statement for the purpose of determining whether or not this procurement will be set aside for small/small disadvantaged businesses.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS 562112 with a size standard of $10.5 million.   

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the world?s largest biomedical research facility.  Direct research and support activities are performed by approximately 18,000 employees working at the 340 acre main campus located in Bethesda, MD, the 513 acre NIH Animal Center (NIHAC) in Poolesville, MD and at approximately 30 off-site installations located in the greater Baltimore - Washington DC metropolitan area.  The operations on the NIH main campus include  approximately forty buildings,  3,000 research laboratories, and a research hospital.

The NIH manages all of its chemical, mixed and radioactive wastes at the Waste Management Facility located in Building 21 and other locations on the NIH main campus.  The Contractor shall be responsible for managing and providing on-site, comprehensive waste management services for the collection, transportation, and disposal of chemical, radioactive and mixed wastes generated by the NIH.    The Contractor shall be responsible for providing sufficient experienced, qualified personnel, equipment, vehicles, and management support necessary to successfully provide the full spectrum of waste management services required.  Major required services include the collection, receiving, processing, packaging, shipping and disposal of chemical, mixed and radioactive wastes.  The Contractor shall be responsible for arranging all recycling and disposal of waste generated by NIH including transportation to disposal facilities by transporters.  The Contractor shall maximize the use of domestic treatment facilities that employ validated, best available technologies to permanently destroy or render the NIH waste nonhazardous.  There is significant electronic data tracking required for all of the waste management activities.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for performing treatment of chemical, radioactive and mixed wastes at the Waste Management Facility, as allowed by the Part B Permit and NRC License.  Treatments include but are not limited to chemical oxidation of mixed wastes, neutralization of corrosive wastes and activated carbon treatment of aqueous radioactive wastes.  Other significant Contractor responsibilities include on-site analytical testing as required by regulatory permits and licenses, and providing chemical moving services for NIH researchers undergoing a laboratory relocation.  The on-site analytical testing requires the use of  various types of Government-provided analytical equipment.  The chemical move services are expected to be rather demanding due to the significant magnitude of  planned new construction and renovation work at the NIH.

Interested businesses with the appropriate level of resources, experience and expertise are encouraged to respond to this notice.  The levels of required resources, experience and expertise are listed and described below.


1.	Operation of a RCRA TSD Facility for a customer that includes performing on-site treatments.  This work requires a high level of staff expertise including but not limited to: an expert knowledge of hazardous waste and Clean Water Act regulations.

2.	Operation of a NRC or State licensed waste management facility that includes performing on-site treatments.  This work requires a high level of staff expertise including but not limited to: an expert knowledge of radioactive waste and Clean Water Act regulations.

3.	Experience and expertise in collecting, receiving, packaging, shipping and disposing of hazardous wastes for a singe customer in quantities similar to the estimated 160 tons of hazardous wastes processed and shipped annually from the NIH.  Approximately 300 shipments of hazardous wastes are required annually.  This level of service requires extensive resources including but not limited to: an extensive trucking and routing system that can efficiently deliver NIH hazardous waste to designated disposal facilities across the nation; available staff with a high level of expertise in DOT and hazardous waste regulations to ensure compliant packaging and shipping; and an experienced staff capable of operating this type of routing system.  

4.

5.	Experience performing on-site electronic tracking of the types and quantities of waste management activities described above.

6.	Experience in performing waste analyses services for chemical, mixed and radioactive wastes.  This experience requires staff with an expert knowledge in chemistry and radiation physics plus expert abilities to operate the complex, specialized analytical equipment.

7.	Experience in lab packing techniques used for the packaging and shipment of hazardous wastes.  These skills are required to perform the chemical moves services required under the contract.  This service requires the Contractor to package laboratory chemicals in the same manner as used for hazardous waste shipping and final delivery to another laboratory location.

Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, expertise, and available resources to perform the various tasks of this requirement.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether sufficient small businesses possess the experience, expertise and qualifications to ensure competition under a set-aside acquisition.   A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Technology Transfer Opportunity- Physical Security and/or Video Motion Detection
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY
Physical Security and/or Video Motion Detection 

Sandia National Laboratories, the lead laboratory for the Department of Energy's physical security research and development, is looking for one or more companies in the physical security and/or video motion detection market to engage in commercialization of three-dimensional video motion detection software.   Sandia is interested in industrial participants with well-documented experience in providing a path to market following a successful prototype demonstration.  A background in security, ability to maintain and modify the system, and video software capability will be needed.  The initial market is DOE sites, but the system can be applied to industrial and commercial security systems as well.  

The 3D Video Motion Detection software, a technology for improved video motion detection and assessment, was developed at the Security Systems and Technology Center 5800 at Sandia.  The technology utilizes multiple CCTV camera views (typically 4 cameras) to survey a region of interest, report the presence of intruders, and provide a 3D representation of the detected object for improved visual assessment.  The processing of multiple camera views provides a system that is resistant to nuisance alarms, system tampering, and camera malfunction or abnormalities.  In addition, the system provides high level information about detected intruders in near real time, and a 3D graphical assessment capability over low bandwidth communication links.

Several 3D video motion detection (3DVMD) prototypes have been developed and the system is currently at a state where engagement and collaboration with parties interested in the commercialization or further development of the technology is welcomed.  For further information regarding this technology or to express your interest, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by November 1, 2002 at:  Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115.  Fax (505) 844-8011.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your firm could best contribute to the commercialization of this technology.

DESCRIPTION: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) PMW 179-1 is announcing the second JTRS-Maritime /Fixed Cluster III Industry Day will take place on 23-24 October 2002 and will be held in San Diego at the Booz, Allen, and Hamilton offices located at: Hazard Center 1615 Murray Canyon Rd Suite 220 San Diego, California 92108 Phone - (619) 725-6500 The Industry Day activities will include opening remarks by the JTRS-M /F Program Manager, a JTRS-M/F Program Status Briefing by the Acquisition Program Manager, and also include in-depth industry to government one-on-one sessions. This Industry Day is an open forum and all interested vendors are encouraged to attend.  For potential prime/system integrator vendors two hours will be allocated for the one-on-one sessions.  For potential subcontractor vendors 1 hour will be allowed. This CBD announcement invites all interested and potential vendors to submit information during the industry to government one-on-one sessions IAW with the below categories. Potential vendors have already been invited to provide information in the form of comments and questions on the draft JTRS M/F System Specification and associated Statement of objectives (SOO).  During the one-on-one sessions potential vendors may brief the government on proprietary or non-proprietary information in the following critical categories as it will be deemed procurement sensitive: 1) Proposed system architectures including RF distribution and Control. 2) Engineering approach/technical challenges. 3) System design tradeoffs between threshold and objective requirements. 4) Cost drivers - What particular requirements significantly increase the system cost? 5) Level of effort to Port GFE waveforms. 6) SCA compliant hardware and operating environment issues. 7) Identify key risk areas. 8) Schedule - Design and production timeline. 9) Suggested contract type. 10) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing by channel and 4-channel system increment. The anticipated release date for the official JTRS-M/F Block I Request for Proposal (RFP) is in the 4th quarter FY03  timeframe with contract award anticipated in the 2nd quarter FY04. It is estimated that successful offerors will have approximately eighteen 18 months from contract award to provide engineering demonstration models for testing. Background: The objectives of the Joint Tactical Radio System Maritime Fixed (JTRS M/F) Cluster III program is to acquire a family of multi-mode, multi-band, software programmable radios and associated RF distribution and control equipment to support Maritime radio room and Fixed Site replacement and new technology equipment.  The intent is to increase operational flexibility, enhance joint interoperability, and reduce life cycle cost. JTRS M/F will be capable of transmitting voice, video, and data while operating in frequency bands from 2 MHz to 2000 MHz with capability to migrate above 2 GHz in the future.  In order to facilitate an orderly and cost-effective migration from legacy systems, the new JTRS M/F shall maintain backward compatibility with selected legacy systems and provide a seamless technological transition path to support the next generation radio room.  For purposes of this informational request, the JTRS M/F will be defined as a complete end to end communications system with a combination of hardware elements, supporting software infrastructure, and government furnished waveform applications. This system will include all RF distribution and control equipment to support voice, video, and data communications. The JTRS Program is a series of related but independent joint acquisitions. The Army is the Executive Service lead for the joint activities executed by the JPO.  The JPO is responsible for defining, developing, validating, and maintaining the SCA and acquiring software waveform applications.  The JTRS M/F (Cluster-3) Program Manager (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PMW 179-1) is responsible for developing JTRS M/F hardware and an SCA compliant operating environment to include porting independently acquired waveforms, integrating the waveforms, and fielding the JTRS M/F as a final consolidated product in support of the fleet.  One of the key goals of the system is to ensure maximum scalability, modularity, and extensibility across all ship classes and fixed site platforms. However, all responsible parties that can provide data to demonstrate that they may successfully propose/bid to produce the JTRS-M/F system (or subsystems that will support JTRS-M/F) in a free and open competition as called out in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and Specification are encouraged to attend and actively participate in this Industry Day. Responses indicating vendor interest, scheduling of one-on-ones, and questions shall be e-mailed to Mark Lopez, SPAWAR 02-32, mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil.  Questions or requests for additional information must be in writing and e-mailed to Mark Lopez, SPAWAR 02-32, mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil.
