<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, devices, and materials and perform all work required to Construct Newport Research Antenna Measurement Facility, Newport, NY.
<p>The AFRL requires construction of a new approximately 5,000 SF research antenna measurement facility and demolition of existing structures. The nature of work will require coordination of several construction elements including new concrete and structural steel work, earthworks, demolition, HAZMAT abatement, paving, and typical commercial and institutional facility construction. Installation and construction of a standalone fire protection system, including water reservoir, freeze protection, and pump, will be required.</p>
<p>The new building will consist of an elevated antenna bay structure, an attached single-story research laboratory facility, and a concrete foundation for a large antenna silo/tower structure. The superstructure of the elevated antenna bay will be a combination of structural steel and reinforced concrete. The research laboratory facility will consist of research and test labs and meeting space. The superstructure of the antenna silo will consist of fabricated structural members and plate steel. However, only the construction of the silo foundation is within scope of the project. Supply and erection of the tower is NOT in scope. Site improvements will include site storm drainage, a new access road to the site that also connects with the existing northerly access road, and asphalt parking areas. Decommissioning and demolition of the existing structures is required once the proposed new facility is constructed and online. Work is expected to be performed in phases sequentially. The new structure will be constructed while the existing remain in operation.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a Total Small Business Set-Aside IAW FAR 19.15. The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with an associated small business size standard of $36,500,000 average annual revenue.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.<br /><br />The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be posted online at the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov under the reference number FA875118B0003 on or about 31 JUL 2017. Bids will be due approximately 30 days later. A site visit will be conducted about 10 days after issuance of the IFB. The date will be finalized when the IFB is posted.</p>
<p>The IFB documents will only be available electronically. Potential bidders will be responsible for downloading the IFB documents and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and any additional information.</p>
<p>Award will be a firm fixed price (FFP) contract resulting from a competitive IFB. Competing bidder's bids shall be ranked according to price. Award will be made to the lowest priced responsible bidder, whose bid is responsive to the terms of the IFB. Bids will be accepted on an all or none basis only. Partial bids will not be accepted. Successful bidders will be selected based upon the lowest total evaluated price (TEP).</p>

<DESC>Supreme Allied Commander Transformation Headquarters (HQ SACT) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for the provision of Contractor Support for its Training Directorate in Norfolk, Virginia.
<p>Potential prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government, and 3) have&nbsp;performed two similar contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation. <br /><br />Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must 1) be citizens of a NATO nation, 2) have committed no criminal offences, and 3) have appropriate professional training and experience.</p>
<p>The reference for this project is IFIB-ACT-SACT-18-70.</p>
<p>Award Type: Lowest Price, Technically Compliant</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>A. In order to promulgate and promote SACT's Intent and Vision, documents produced as output by the headquarters staff must be of the highest quality. HQ SACT creates many documents which are targeted at NATO HQ, SHAPE and National Authorities. These documents are used to influence decisions, create policy throughout NATO and justify the HQ Program of work. These documents must be extremely clear, concise and using proper grammar and formatting. The majority of Job Descriptions for this HQ require Standard Language Proficiency of 3 in English for writing and speaking. For the documents produced as output from this HQ the standard needs to be higher in order for them to provide the necessary desired impact on the receiving audience.</p>
<p>B. Conduct on-site training courses for HQ personnel: Each course will provide a minimum of 16.5 hours of instruction per student for 10 participants. This will include 15 hours of group classroom instruction, 0.5 hours of individual student needs assessment at the beginning of the course and 1 hour personal coaching for each student at the end of the course to help the student apply the lessons to their current projects. The course should be conducted as a writing workshop and NATO documents and participants' writing are used as sample documents throughout the course.</p>
<p>C. Writing, Communication and Editing Support: Individual writing coaching and editing support will be provided on-site to graduates of the writing course at HQ by the same Instructor who delivered the group instruction to continue the writing development of the participants and to contribute substantively to the high quality of documents at ACT. This support will be available to the Staff Element Europe (SEE) graduates via electronic means. Communication coaching and support will be provided on an as needed basis and billed hourly.</p>
<p>D. The instructor for this course is required hold a minimum of a Masters of English or related field from an accredited university.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. U.S. firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>Upon approval of the one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE), which is the document used to nominate an approved facility to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) - soliciting from a single source). The proposed source is Satisloh North America, Inc., N106 W13131 Bradley Way, Suite 200, Germantown, WI 53022. The requirement is for a replacement part required for the repair of a VFT Orbit Ophthalmic Lens Generator, manufactured by Satisloh North America, Inc., located at the Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity (NOSTRA).
<p>This acquisition is for one (1) B-Axis VFT V07-2 complete Encoder Motor (Part# 02-065-551) for NOSTRA; this requirement is for a replacement part only. The B-Axis Encoder Motor (VFT V07-2 complete) shall be compatible with the VFT Orbit Ophthalmic Lens Generator (Model #0100157) manufactured by Satisloh North America, Inc. The part shall be new; a used or refurbished par will not be accepted. NOSTRA has 5 Robotic Orbit Robotic Generators that operate in the Surfacing section of the lab and one of these machines is down. The B-Axis Encoder Motor is inoperative on one (1) of the generators and needs to be replaced so that production and mission can be accomplished. With only 4 machines on-line, production capability is reduced by 20%. This is limiting NOSTRA's ability to maintain readiness jobs for military personnel. The procurement of this vital part is necessary to bring the Robotic Orbit Generator back on line as soon as possible and bring production numbers back up to needed levels.</p>
<p>Required production levels cannot be maintained with only 4 Robotic Orbit Generators on-line. It is negatively affecting NOSTRA's ability to provide the necessary eyewear and Combat Eye Protection that military forces are required to have, per current mandated government regulations.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for quotes and no solicitation document exists for the requirement; however, if a vendor challenges the basis for this requirement, please submit a capability statement that includes sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to submit a product meeting the minimum requirements specified above. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source procurement.</p>
<p>If a vendor challenges the basis of this requirement, please email capability statements (formats for submission: PDF, MS Word, or MS Excel) to Andrew Hampton at andrew.a.hampton3.civ@mail.mil. Closing date for challenges is no later than 1300 Eastern time on 20 September 2018. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Perkins Elmer. Perkins Elmer offers the Chemagic 360 would be used for on going studies it would replace and old Chemagic MSM1. Vetted and established DNA extraction protocols on these instruments include 1)DNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues, 2) cervical epithelial cells in Digene Speciman Transport Medium, 3) cervical epithelial cells in BD SurePath and 4) keratiznized epidermal skin cells in Digene Specimen Transport Medium. A newly acquired Chemagic 360 would be able to use the same regents, supplies and programs as the existing MSM1 does. Therefore the procedurs from the existing MSM1 and 360 can be transferred directly to a new 360 without the time and cost expense of protocol redevelopment on a different instrument platform. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist at tgw4@cdc.gov by COB 10, September 2018</p>

The allotted time for this is one (1) full week of training (5 days/40 hours). A maximum of 50 attendees are expected to attend. It will be held at a government facility and the interest and video conference will be made available for the training and broadcasting of that training.

<SUBJECT>Long Baseline Neutrino Facility - Liquid Nitrogen Refrigeration System
<SOLNBR>LBNF-NitrogenSystem-JLK
<CONTACT>Chris Allen, Sr. Procurement Administrator, Phone 6308404829, Email callen@fnal.gov
<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUMMARY</span></p>
<p>Under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Fermi Research Alliance, LLC (FRA) is leading the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) Project to enable a world-class program in neutrino physics.&nbsp; Specifically, the LBNF Project (http://lbnf.fnal.gov/) provides the infrastructure for a new high-intensity neutrino beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) aimed at large liquid argon-based neutrino detectors to be located nearly a mile underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, SD.&nbsp; In close coordination with LBNF, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will construct and install the liquid argon neutrino detectors planned for SURF.&nbsp; In support of DUNE, the LBNF Project will construct a Nitrogen System on the surface and deep underground at the 4850-foot level (4850L) at SURF to provide refrigeration for the liquid argon neutrino detectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>DUNE (http://www.dunescience.org/) is a leading-edge, international experiment for neutrino science and proton decay studies.&nbsp; Discoveries over the past half-century have put neutrinos, the most abundant matter particles in the universe, in the spotlight for further research into several fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the evolution of the universe. DUNE is expected to achieve transformative discoveries by making definitive determinations of neutrino properties, examining the dynamics of supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and probing the possibility of proton decay.</p>
<p>The experiment is supported by LBNF, which will provide the infrastructure necessary to support the massive neutrino detectors located deep underground at SURF in Lead, SD. SURF is the site of the 8,000-foot deep former Homestake Gold mine which was converted into a physics and materials laboratory in the early 2000s.&nbsp; DUNE will employ four (4) neutrino detectors, housed in cryostats requiring nearly 70,000 tons of liquid argon (about 17,400 tons for each cryostat).&nbsp; In order to commission the detectors, liquid argon will be supplied at the surface, vaporized for transport to the experiment a mile underground, and condensed to liquid argon for the filling of the cryostats.&nbsp; During operation of the cryostats, argon boiloff gas from the cryostats will be recondensed back to liquid argon.&nbsp; Enclosure 1 shows the planned Process Flow Diagram (PFD) with only one cryostat for simplicity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NITROGEN SYSTEM</span></p>
<p>The Nitrogen System is a closed loop cryogenic refrigeration system (Enclosure 3) and is composed of the following elements:</p>
<p>Liquid Nitrogen Refrigeration System</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Nitrogen Compression - Four gaseous nitrogen compressors (above ground).</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Nitrogen Refrigeration - Four refrigeration units comprised of cold boxes and expanders, each with a capacity of 100 kW (below ground - 4850L).</p>
<p>Liquid Nitrogen Storage - Provides 1766&nbsp;cubic feet (50 cubic meters) of buffer and backup liquid nitrogen storage in pressurized dewars (below ground - 4850L).</p>
<p>Argon Condensers - Evaporation of liquid nitrogen provides the cooling power to liquefy argon gas via heat exchangers (below ground - 4850L).</p>
<p>Interconnecting Piping - Includes high-pressure and low-pressure gaseous nitrogen piping linking the above ground compressors with the below ground nitrogen refrigeration units, the insulated liquid nitrogen distribution headers, and gaseous nitrogen return headers (Enclosure 2). <br />&nbsp;<br />The nitrogen refrigeration system will provide a total refrigeration capacity of 400 kW, supplied by four (4) units, each with a capacity of 100 kW with turndown capability to 80 kW. The refrigerator system mass flow balance shall be maintained by this turndown capacity, as well as auxiliary operation of electrical heaters.</p>
<p>At this time, it is anticipated that the interconnecting piping and Argon Condensers will be provided by FRA.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF WORK</span></p>
<p>The scope of work is for a Design-Build project that will consist of all items and costs for labor, equipment, transportation, overhead, bonding, safety oversight, quality control oversight and supervision as required for the architectural, engineering, design, fabrication, and mobilization required to procure, install, and commission a Nitrogen System composed of a Liquid Nitrogen Refrigeration System and Liquid Nitrogen Storage dewars at SURF in Lead, SD as described above.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED PROCUREMENT APPROACH AND SCHEDULE OF THE WORK</span></p>
<p>The procurement is for a turnkey system with a phased activity/event approach.&nbsp; The phasing has been formulated to provide flexibility in the scheduling of this project with respect to the larger LBNF Project and DUNE program.&nbsp; As requirements are refined and schedules are developed during preliminary and final design, additional levels of phasing or scheduling constraints may be warranted.&nbsp; FRA anticipates issuing a future RFP (and later contract to a single turnkey contractor) for the design, fabrication, installation, and commissioning of the Liquid Nitrogen Refrigeration System and Liquid Nitrogen Storage.</p>
<p>The solicitation is expected to be released by FRA in November of 2018.&nbsp; The award and scheduling of work is dependent on the availability of funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Award of a subcontract is anticipated for 2nd Quarter Calendar Year (CY) 2019 with the design work to start immediately.</p>

<ARCHDATE>12312018
<CONTACT>Bernadette J. Kan, Contract Specialist, Phone 2164332525, Email bernadette.j.kan@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of multilayer coatings within cooling channels in&nbsp;the Government provided cooling channels of 12" and 18" long hexagonal rods with 19 cooling channels to: (a) optimize the processing parameters for depositing these multilayered coating architectures and thicknesses by chemical vapor deposition (CVD); (b) establish best practices and methodologies; and (c) deliver specimens for microstructural analyses, thermal cycling and other tests, and proof-of-concept demonstration.
<p>NASA/GRC intends to purchase the services from Ultramet. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.<br />Only Ultramet has the expertise and facilities in CVD technology to ensure successful deposit of the multi-layered coatings on NASA-provided Graphite (Gr) substrates of different geometries. Ultramet is currently working on developing methodologies and processing parameters for coating disks as well as coating hexagonal rods with 19-hole channels, 0.75" flat-to-flat and 6" long. Thus, it is essential that the contract for fabricating the new batch of test specimens be issued to Ultramet Corp. so as to ensure that the processing parameters and coating methodologies are identical to those used in the first batch being fabricated under our current contract (80GRC017P0012). They have performed tasks that are fairly complex and require considerable expertise in CVD coating of Gr substrates since there is a steep learning process to develop processing parameters and methodologies. Only Ultramet Corp. can ensure that theses processing parameters and coating methodologies are identical to those used in the first batch being fabricated under our current contract.&nbsp;Award to any other company would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable schedule delays to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 7, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.<br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html</p>

<DESC>This National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Announcement (NRA) solicits ground-based research proposals from established researchers and graduate students to generate new scientific insights by utilizing experimental data residing in NASA's Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) system (http://psi.nasa.gov), an online database of completed physical science reduced-gravity flight experiments conducted on the International Space Station (ISS), Space Shuttle flights, Free-flyers, or commercial cargo flights to and from the ISS, and related ground-based studies. The solicitation (NNH17ZTT001N-17PSI-E), entitled "Use of the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics System - Appendix E," will be available on or about September 14, 2018. Upon release, the solicitation will be found via the following steps:<br />1. Open the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ <br />2. Select "Solicitations" <br />3. Select "Open Solicitations"<br />4. Select "Use of the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics System NNH17ZTT001N" <br />5. Select List of Open Program Elements <br />6. Select "Use of the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics System - Appendix E" <br />7. Select "Appendix E NNH17ZTT001N-17PSI-E" under Announcement Documents.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>NASA plans to host a proposers' conference via WebEx shortly after the release of the Appendix to provide more information and to answer questions about the NRA and the PSI system.</p>
<p>NASA's Physical Sciences Research Program conducts fundamental and applied physical sciences research, with the objective of enabling exploration and pioneering scientific discovery. NASA's experiments in the various disciplines of physical science reveal how physical systems respond to the near absence of gravity. They also reveal how other forces that on Earth are small, as compared to gravity, can dominate system behavior in space.</p>
<p>The PSI system (http://psi.nasa.gov) is an online, publicly accessible database of completed physical science reduced-gravity flight experiments conducted on the ISS, on Space Shuttle flights, on Free Flyers, or on commercial cargo flights to and from the ISS, and related ground-based studies. It is a tool designed for researchers to data mine information from reduced-gravity physical sciences experiments and use it to further science in accordance with the open science approach, while also meeting the requirements of the nation's Open Data Policy. This NRA solicits ground-based research proposals that present a compelling case on how the experimental data from the PSI system will be used to promote the advancement of further research. Proposers must show a clear path from the scientific data obtained from the PSI system to the proposed investigation. In addition, the project must address an important problem in the proposed area of research and advance scientific knowledge or technology.</p>
<p>This NRA will remain open until 2022, with planned annual opportunities to propose to be provided through a series of appendices. This announcement is for the release of Appendix E, which solicits proposals in the following five research areas: Combustion Science, Complex Fluids, Fluid Physics, Fundamental Physics and Materials Science. The Appendix specifically solicits proposals that utilize data from eligible investigations in the PSI; see the full Appendix E for the list of the eligible PSI investigations. Proposals for Appendix E are due on or about December 14, 2018.</p>
<p>This solicitation is applicable to researchers in all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, nonprofit organizations, NASA Centers and other U.S. Government agencies. This NRA is soliciting proposals from two types of investigators: 1) established researchers, including postdoctoral scholars; 2) graduate students (with academic advisors) from accredited U.S. postsecondary institutions and programs. Proposals from graduate students must be submitted by their advisor.</p>
<p>Principal Investigators (PIs) may collaborate with investigators from universities, Federal Government laboratories, the private sector, state and local government laboratories, and other countries. Proposals including international participation are eligible, provided NASA policies regarding the conduct of research with non-U.S. organizations are met.</p>
<p>Proposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Proposals must be submitted electronically. Proposers may use either NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ ) or Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov ) for proposal submission.</p>
<p>Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organization representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Instructions on how to register in NSPIRES are provided in the NRA. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g., co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Questions with regard to responding to this NRA may be addressed to the contacts referenced in the full solicitation document.</p>
<p>This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, nspires.nasaprs.com, or Grants.gov, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: Pre-Solicitation<br />Response Date: 09/15/2018 10:00 am Eastern<br />Archiving Policy: Automatic, 15 days after response due date<br />Base Notice: Notice of NIST's Intent to Negotiate on Sole Source Basis for Perpetual software licenses for Vic3D and VicSnap image correlation software
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Correlated Solutions, Inc., located at 121 Dutchman Blvd, Irmo, Sc, 29063-8330 to purchase Perpetual software licenses for Vic3D and VicSnap image correlation software.</p>
<p>NIST Materials Performance Group Develops measurement methods, models, data, standards, and science for the mechanical properties of advanced materials (e.g., high strength steel, aluminum alloys, composites) and materials under extreme environmental and operating conditions. The group provides expertise needed to determine materials and system performance within and outside design limits and generates and disseminates reliable mechanical property data in application areas such as transportation and physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Group requires the procurement of a single seat perpetual license for Vic3D and VicSnap digital image correlation (DIC) software to measure critical mechanical property data on additively manufactured materials as part of a focused research effort on additive manufacturing. DIC is a technique that enables high-resolution measurements of the displacements that occur during mechanical testing in three-dimensions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to improve the previous versions of the software, which are unable to perform accurate, 3D digital image correlation in an environment where images of objects immersed in a liquid within a confined cell having transparent walls, by considering refraction of light at the liquid/wall and wall/air interfaces.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following: NIST previously acquired under contract SB1341-17-SU-0619. The present acquisition seeks to add to this hardware a corresponding stand-alone calibration and analysis software package, called Vic3D, sold exclusively by Correlated Solutions, Inc, to fulfill the NIST requirement for a stand-alone measurement instrument. The measurement instrument consists of cameras and a computer needed to capture images, a set of calibration targets, and software used to compute physical measurement data from the images via a proprietary calibration and analysis routine. In addition, NIST requires that the physical measurement data computed from the calibrated images can be used in a closed-cell liquid environment, which is a highly specialized application that requires adjustments to the image computation to take into account the changes in refractive index of the liquid and the cell chamber wall. Correlated Solutions, Inc, has developed proprietary software to handle these changes in refractive index specifically for making such measurements, and are the only known vendor to be able to handle this problem. NIST staff has extensive experience with the Vic software such that no staff time is required for training or implementation of the software; hence, Correlated Solutions, Inc. is capable of meeting the specifications.</p>
<p>Market research, found that no third-party vendors capable of meeting the requirement.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 511210 with a size standard of 38.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 10:00 AM ET on September 15, 2018, will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-18-R-4410 for the execution of the USS RUSHMORE (LSD 47) Fiscal Year (FY) 19 Dry-Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) on the West Coast. The availability will include a combination of maintenance, modernization, and repair, and is expected to require a highly capable contractor with substantial facilities, to include a WHIDBEY ISLAND-Class Dock Landing Ship capable pier and dry-dock as well as human resources capable of completing, coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair, and modernization. The delivery date of the vessel is expected to be no later than 30 May 2020.
<p>In accordance with the CNO's Homeport Statute, 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c), CNO availabilities with production periods estimated to be greater than 10 months are considered long-term and will be competed on a coast-wide basis, without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. As the production period for the FY19 DMP is greater than 10 months, the availability shall be competed on a coast-wide (East and Gulf coasts) basis. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement and therefore this procurement will not be set-aside for small business (FAR 19.502-2(b)).</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation, and any applicable amendments. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet. This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. <br />The Government anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around 14 September 2018.<br />The Government anticipates making a single award on or around 28 January 2019.</p>

<CONTACT>Tyus, Renita
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i), with Reaction Engineering International (REI) to enhance and update the existing Configured Fireside Simulator (CFS) software to operate more efficiently in EPA's Windows 10 computing environment as well as to improve the configuration and output of the CFS models to facilitate more rapid setup and presentation of the predicted results.

The CFS was developed in 2005 to provide for the ability to run "what if" scenarios of waste streams contaminated with chemical and biological agents in the EPA's pilot-scale Rotary Kiln Incinerator Simulator (RKIS) facility, as well as 3 commercial incinerators based on design criteria for actual operating facilities, including a Medical/Pathological Waste Incinerator, a Hazardous Waste Burning Rotary Kiln, and a Waste-to-Energy Stoker type combustor. CFS uses chemical kinetic data for destruction of chemical warfare agents derived from a Department of Defense Small Business Innovative Research Grant (SBIR) with Reaction Engineering International (REI), coupled with biological agent destruction kinetic data derived from bench- and pilot-scale experiments performed at EPA¿s Research Triangle Park, NC facility. 

REI has developed and validated chemical kinetic mechanisms for the destruction of military nerve agents including VX and GB, which are threat agents of interest to the EPA. In addition, they have used their expertise to couple these kinetic mechanisms with complex fluid dynamics simulation code developed in-house at REI in order to examine issues related to the potential release of chemical warfare agents from hypothetical failure modes from the Army's chemical demilitarization (chemical warfare agent destruction) facilities. The EPA's National Homeland Security Research Center's (NHSRC) is investigating issues related to disposal of chemical/biological-contaminated indoor and outdoor urban materials using thermal incineration, where the chemical agents are bound on porous substrates rather than as pure chemicals in containers. Other similarities include some of the target compounds for which REI has already developed mechanisms (VX, GB), and the process for which their code is successfully operating (full-scale thermal incinerator). 

The EPA has identified REI as the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s) because the proprietary chemical warfare agent kinetic destruction mechanisms developed by REI (with close collaboration with the Army) for the SBIR grant are unique and are the property of REI. There are no other CW agent thermal decomposition mechanisms available to the modeling community. Their combustor modeling that was done for the Army used the designs for the Army's chemical warfare agent incineration systems located at the Toole Army Depot; the work for the EPA used the same mechanisms and combustion/fluid mechanics approach but used design parameters from commercially available incinerators rather than the Army¿s facilities. The purpose of the work described in this procurement is to 1) enhance the functionality of CFS to reflect needs identified since its initial development; 2) improve compatibility of CFS with the EPA Windows 10 computing environment; 3) enhance the user interface of CFS to facilitate rapid setup of cases to run; and 4) enhance the output capability of CFS to facilitate delivery of results to decision makers

This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures and FAR PART 13 Procedures. The award will be for a period of up to 12 months.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS. Any firm that is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.  A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this posting must be submitted via the FedConnect website at https://www.fedconnect.net through the message center for 68HE0C18Q0175.  Mail, fax, phone and email submissions shall not be accepted.  EPA anticipates that award will be October 31, 2018.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed price contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Life Technologies Corporation for proprietary maintenance and repair support services for ABI Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer, Serial # 20141-006.

Market research revealed that Life Technologies Corporation is the proprietary developer and distributor for the equipment currently being utilized by VA. Additionally, Life Technologies Corporation is the only manufacturer that can provide the required maintenance support for the equipment. The software system is routinely used by VA to provide medical services for veterans in the VA Healthcare System. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811219 and the service code is J065.

However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to curt.larose@va.gov within 30 calendar days after publication of this notice. Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Base Item 
Site 1: Surface Parking Lot - Carport PV (see site plan attachment 11). The intent for Site 1 is to have carport structures providing a minimum 550 kW of power (DC Wattage). The carports are to be double cantilevered steel frame structures and rail supported modules (i.e. the solar module arrays will attach to rail supports rated for 140 mph winds and NOT a metal standing seam type roof). The steel frame is to be painted white. At each of 4 potential entrances to this site install a height indicator over both travel lanes that limits entrance to 8 feet and 6 inches so as to provide protective measure for steel canopy and PV module railing system.

The electric power generated by this Solar PV system may be supplied to the closest switchgear with available capacity that connects to the facility distribution system. The surface parking lot adjacent to the parking garage is constructed of asphalt pavement and concrete traffic islands to control traffic movement and to contain landscaping. The parking lot has 2-lane traffic between parking bays that are all striped perpendicular to the traffic lanes. The parking lot has trees along the perimeter and in several of the traffic islands. The trees located in the traffic islands adjacent to the proposed canopies are to be removed and hauled off site. Tree stumps and roots are to be grinded to a minimum of 6 inches below existing grade.

A $100,000 allowance for Utility interconnection fees/equipment/services is included. Actual amounts will need to be determined after award of contract.

Option Item
Site 2: Building 25 electric scooter charging station and covered parking (see site plan, Attachment 11). The intent for site 3 is a steel framed structure providing a minimum 2.5 kW of power (DC Wattage). The steel framed structure shall cover the 7 spaces at the existing electric scooter charging station area located at Building 25 (see site plan). A solar module array will connect to the facilities distribution grid. The steel framed structure is to be anchored into the concrete footings that already exist at this location. The steel framed structure is to be painted white and is to have rail supported modules that are designed for 140 mph wind loads.



Option Item
Site 3: Building 14 roof top PV (see site plan, Attachment 11). The intent for site 3 is to construct a solar PV system providing a minimum 40 kW of power (DC Wattage) that connects to the metal standing seams of the existing roof of Building 14. It is proposed to locate the inverters and combiners in the conditioned attic space of Building 14 and to tie the power generated by the PV system into the facility distribution system at the nearest transformer.


Work includes but is not limited to the equipment and material selection, all structural elements, concrete placement, grounding/ bonding, lightning protection, DC / AC electrical distribution, Lighting under carport canopies, grading, trenching and asphalt replacement and installation of a complete Photovoltaic solar system.

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: ROOFING CONSTRUCTION

The Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK, is establishing a Qualified Vendors List (QVL) used for recovering or removal and installation of roofing systems to be used for multiple FAA procurements at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC). Individual projects will range in price from $10,000 - $1,000,000. Each project will be at least 1,000 square foot.  The MMAC’s largest roof is 114,000 square feet.  

Roofing types included under this QVL are:

	Modified bitumen roofs by Siplast, Soprema, Performance/Derbigum

	Single Ply PVC roofs by Sarnafil S327, Soprema Sentinel

	Metal roofs by MBCI, Berridge, McElroy, Butler

As requirements are identified, Requests for Offer (RFO) will be issued to approved QVL vendors classified by roof type, i.e. Modified Bitumen, Single Ply PVC or Metal Roofs.  QVL vendors may qualify for more than one roofing type.

•	New roofing projects will be competed amongst the QVL vendors for that roofing type, i.e. Modified Bitumen vendors, Single Ply PVC vendors or Metal Roof vendors.  

•	Repairs to existing roofs will be competed amongst the QVL vendors for that manufacturer.

To be considered for inclusion on the QVL, the following minimum qualification requirements of this initial Screening Information Request (SIR) must be met.  

(A) The QVL is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) defines a small business as, “...independently owned and operated and not dominant in producing the products or performing the services being purchased, and one that qualifies as a small business under the federal government's criteria and North American Industry System Classification Codes size standards.”  For this procurement, vendors must be classified as a small business under NAICS code 238160 ($15M).  All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) at time of submittal.  

(B) Vendors must provide evidence of their capability to meet the following six criteria: 

Factor 1 – Vendor must state that they can meet the response times specified in the QVL Procedures, Section 1.3.2.

Factor 2 – Letter of Certification from manufacturer(s) stating vendor is approved applicator for at least 5 years for type of roof system

Factor 3 - Past Performance Surveys 

Factor 4 – Documentation from the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) stating an Experience Modification Rating (EMR) of 1.0 or less
 
Factor 5 – Documentation stating that project manager is employed by the QVL vendor or the installer and that the job site superintendent and all roofing applicators are employed directly by the installer

Factor 6 – Current registration with Oklahoma Construction Industries Board per the Oklahoma “Roofing Contractor Registration Act”

(C) Technical evaluation factors as listed below are intended to determine the vendor's capabilities to effectively and efficiently accomplish the performance of the contract.

(1) Factor 1 – Vendor must be able to meet response times specified in the QVL Procedures, Section 1.3.2. Submittal shall indicate vendor’s ability to respond within 2 ½ hours of notification for emergency requirements.

Evaluation Criteria:  The Government’s Technical Evaluation Team will determine that the vendor can meet response times specified in the QVL Procedures, Section 1.3.2.

Failure to demonstrate the minimally acceptability standards under this factor will result in an “UNACCEPTABLE” rating and elimination from further consideration for inclusion on the QVL.

(2) Factor 2 Letter of Certification from manufacturer(s) stating vendor is approved applicator for at least 5 years for type of roof system Vendor shall provide a letter from all applicable manufacturers that vendor has been an approved applicator for at least 5 years for specific roof systems. Vendor shall provide manufacturer’s letter for each type of roof system for which they wish to be qualified.

Evaluation Criteria:  The Government’s Technical Evaluation Team will review the letter(s) from manufacturer(s) stating the vendor is an approved installer and has been so for at least 5 years for that roofing type.

Failure to demonstrate the minimally acceptability standards under this factor will result in an “UNACCEPTABLE” rating and elimination from further consideration for inclusion on the QVL.

(3) Factor 3 Past Performance Surveys Vendors shall have current or past customers complete the Past Performance Survey attached to the Screening Information Request (SIR) (Attachment 1).  A minimum of two (2) but no more than five (5) completed Past Performance Surveys for each manufacturer for which the vendor is seeking qualification shall be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer no later than the SIR closing date.  All Past Performance Surveys submitted must show the projects are underway or completed with the last 5 years through the closing date identified on the SIR.  The vendor’s Past Performance must demonstrate/possess relevant past performance for roofing projects for each manufacturer for which the vendor is seeking qualification. 
Each Past Performance Survey submitted shall be for work that is valued at or over $75,000.
Evaluation Criteria:  The Contracting Officer will review all Past Performance Surveys submitted as well as assessments from the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) or similar reporting systems, and other sources.  Vendors must demonstrate the following minimum acceptability standards to receive an “ACCEPTABLE” rating on this factor:
•	Each Past Performance Survey submitted is for work that is valued at or over $75, 000, AND
•	Each Past Performance Survey submitted must have received a response of “Acceptable” in all areas, AND
•	All Past Performance Surveys submitted must show the roofing projects for the proposed manufacturer(s) are underway or completed with the last 5 years through the closing date identified on the SIR, AND
•	All past or current references must recommend awarding similar contracts or using the vendor again for future work.  

Failure to demonstrate the minimally acceptable criteria under this factor will result in an “UNACCEPTABLE” rating and elimination from further consideration for contract award.  Vendors with no past performance information will receive an “UNACCEPTABLE” rating for this factor.

 It is the responsibility of the vendor to follow-up to ensure the surveys have been returned to the
Contracting Officer by the due date.

(4) Factor 4 – Documentation from NCCI stating an Experience Modification Rating (EMR) of 1.0 or less Vendors shall provide documentation from National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) stating that vendor has an EMR of 1.0 or less. 

Evaluation Criteria:  The Government’s Technical Evaluation Team will review the documentation submitted by the vendor from NCCI stating an experience modification rating (EMR) of 1.0 or less. 

Failure to demonstrate the minimally acceptability standards under this factor will result in an “UNACCEPTABLE” rating and elimination from further consideration for inclusion on the QVL.

(5) Factor 5 – Documentation stating that project manager is employed by the QVL vendor or the installer and that the job site superintendent and all roofing applicators are employed directly by the installer Vendor shall provide documentation stating that the project manager is employed by the QVL vendor or the installer and that the job site superintendent and all roofing applicators are employed directly by the installer.

Evaluation Criteria:  The Government’s Technical Evaluation Team will review the documentation stating the project manager is employed by the QVL vendor or the installer and that the job site superintendent and all roofing applicators are employed directly by the installer. 

Failure to demonstrate the minimally acceptability standards under this factor will result in an “UNACCEPTABLE” rating and elimination from further consideration for inclusion on the QVL.

(6) Factor 6 – Current registration with Oklahoma Construction Industries Board per the Oklahoma “Roofing Contractor Registration Act” Vendor shall provide documentation reflecting current registration with Oklahoma Construction Industries Board.

Evaluation Criteria:  The Government’s Technical Evaluation Team will review the documentation showing registration.

To receive consideration, all documentation required in the previous paragraphs must be received electronically by the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt at connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, September 20, 2018, may not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

Potential vendors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more vendors at any time during the SIR process.

The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of vendors selected for the QVL.  Data submitted that is found to be false will result in permanent removal from consideration for this QVL. 
 
The FAA reserves the right to conduct an on-site survey with companies interested in this requirement.  

All vendors being considered for inclusion on the QVL must meet the criteria for determination of responsibility as defined in the FAA’s Acquisition Management System (AMS) T3.2.2.7.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must:

Lubrication shall be provided by an integral, fully recirculating oil supply which is filtered internally. 

Pumps are single stage, air cooled, and direct driven. Rotation of the pump rotor, which is mounted eccentrically in the pump cylinder, traps entering vapor between rotor vane segments. As rotation continues, vapor is compressed, and then discharged into the exhaust box. Vapors then pass through highly efficient coalescing filters and smoke eliminators to remove 99.9% of lubricating oil from the exhaust. Oil is then returned to the recirculating oil system. Each pump will be equipped with an oil conditioning system which removes particulates and water thus extending the time between oil changes. 

Each pump shall include a check valve, oil temperature switch, inlet filter, flex connector, isolation valve and a built-in anti-suck back valve mounted at the pump inlet, and each pump shall be equipped with three High Performance Carbon Composite vanes, each having a minimum life of 50,000 hours.

<DESC>The Adaptive optics center of Excellence (AOCoE), department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Monterey, CA is currently performing research on High Energy Laser (HEL) beam control systems for the US Navy. One of the technology areas is in the development and evaluation of adaptive optics technologies that are effective for compensating atmospheric turbulence to increase the performance of the Navy’s HEL beam control systems. Using adaptive optics technologies which uses a deformable mirror, a distortion in the laser beam can be corrected. 

The purpose of the contract is to procure a deformable mirror that can be used to compensate for the fast changing deep atmospheric turbulence.
Atmospheric turbulence significantly impacts the laser propagation performance, resulting in degraded performance of HEL systems. In particular, NPS is seeking a deformable mirror that can be integrated and operated in the NPS High Energy Laser (HEL) Beam Control Research Testbed (HBCRT). HBCRT is a unique research testbed developed at NPS to test and evaluate adaptive optics technologies. HBCRT is designed to operate both in the laboratory and at the field and has capabilities to work with kilo-watt range high power lasers with future upgrades.

HBCRT is planned to be operated with 20W laser in the first phase. Extended exposure at that power level still can cause damage deformable mirrors.
In addition, NPS would like to have a deformable mirror that can be upgraded to use with kilo-watt class lasers with proper coating upgrade in the future. HBCRT testbed also requires the mirror clear aperture size to be minimum 2 inches and the whole deformable mirror module still need to fit into the available space. Number of actuators also need to be at least 300 or more to provide enough spatial resolution required to correct deep turbulence caused by the Navy operational environment. 

The required Deformable Mirror must be able to fully reflect 2 inch laser beam in the High-energy Beam Control Testbed (HBCRT) system in preparation for deep turbulence compensation research, educational laboratory exercises, and field testing.
There must be 2.5mm spaced modules. The Deformable mirror must be compatible, otherwise the system will cease to work.

The model required by the Government must meet the specs of Northrop Gumman P/Ns D01-A3009044  and  EA349HVA48.

Please forward all interest and capability to reid.j.chambers@navy.mil.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY

DISCLAIMER
This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this Notice that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.   In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this Notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Notice. Information received as a result of this Notice will become part of our market research and will be used to determine interest and the capability of potential sources. Furthermore, those who respond to this Notice should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission.


Introduction
This is for the third year of the Veterans Legacy Program issued in response to market research conducted under this Sources Sought Notice.

The intent of this Notice is to prepare a Request for Proposal from qualified universities partnered with public school (K-12) institutions in engaging in a program of development for research-based educational outreach materials as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration s (NCA) Veterans Legacy Program (VLP).  NCA has launched VLP to promote memorialization of the nation s veterans  legacy enshrined in national cemeteries.  Responses to this Notice will contribute to VLP s  Local Legacy, National Heritage  program, which seeks to create an experience of learning that builds community and commemoration of veterans  legacy, using National Cemeteries as a resource.

Responses to this Notice should address in what ways students will research, develop, and share their research on the history of veterans interred at National Cemeteries as well as the products of their research, to include development of digital and in-print learning materials, and digital media products that showcase university students teaching school-level students the stories of service and sacrifice of veterans interred in National Cemeteries, and the cost of each.  This research must be conducted under the guidance of qualified instructors (e.g. professors). Proposals should include treatment of veterans interred in National Cemeteries within reasonable proximity to the institution.  

Background
The Veterans Legacy Program was launched by the National Cemetery Administration on Memorial Day 2016, and is now preparing for its third full year with the goal of extending memorialization of the veterans  legacy enshrined in the national cemeteries.  NCA s initial suite of products included in-print lesson plans, digital maps, and other materials written to support the educational outreach needs of two national cemeteries in the pilot program, Riverside (CA) National Cemetery and Beaufort (SC) National Cemetery (http://www.cem.va.gov/legacy/index.asp).  NCA s goal is to develop educational outreach materials for all 136 of its national cemeteries, eventually, in media and formats that reflect the latest in research, instructional technology, and best practices.  

Requirements
NCA seeks a university and public school partnership to focus these efforts on a regional national cemetery. This partnership can include several teachers across several schools and grade-levels in a single school district and can include university faculty members in disciplines such as Education, history, American Studies, graphic design, computer science, or other areas of the humanities, digital humanities, or humanities education who are willing to instruct and mentor their students on the research and development of educational materials for school-level students and the general public on the inherited veterans legacy in the local national cemetery.  Faculty from STEM-related disciplines are also encouraged to apply.  The scope and depth of this partnership can vary in numbers of contributing teachers, school administrators, and university faculty members in each institution, but NCA will require a formalized partnership between school district and university, demonstrated by a letter of commitment or memorandum of agreement, submitted with the proposal.

An illustration of what NCA seeks: via a written agreement, public school teachers working with university faculty on a project that instructs and engages students of all levels in research that leads to commemorating the history of veterans interred in a National Cemetery and presented in variety of publicly accessible digital media formats.  University faculty would provide opportunities for students to research veterans  history and develop educational outreach materials.  School teachers would assist university students in the development of this research into lesson plans and learning materials and then teach these lessons to their students.

Please see lesson plans and media products available at Veterans Legacy Program website for examples of the standard of product we seek for lesson plans https://www.cem.va.gov/legacy/index.asp   These lesson plans serve as a template for style, organization, and adherence to Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  For states not using CCSS, local standards can be used.  In addition to the format and standards, the lessons should be student-centered and designed to engage students with authentic materials, e.g. primary sources, data sets, art or architecture, etc., that allow them to think and respond critically about the Veteran experience through the context of the chosen subject-area.  Such authentic sources should be included in the lesson plan and prepared for students and teachers with appropriate annotation.  Lesson plans should also include sufficient historical background to assist teachers who may be new to the topic.

If the research leads to discovery of alumni of the school and/or university interred at a National Cemetery of focus, NCA would be interested in supporting the commemoration of those alumni-veterans at those national cemeteries; NCA would also support memorialization of those alumni-veterans on school/university grounds, such as the construction of memorials or monuments (include in the budget).  This illustration is only a rough sketch of what NCA seeks.  NCA is supporting and fostering a learning partnership that showcases local history and perspectives, to be featured in the research, and local interest in the forms of commemoration and memorialization.  NCA will provide access to its resources; national cemetery personnel will facilitate the research, testing, and implementation of developed materials for teachers, faculty members, and students of all levels by providing data about Veterans interred in national cemeteries.

Levels of Support
We recognize that some partnerships may differ in terms of size, internal capacity and support.  We ask proposers to acknowledge what their team s capacity will be and seek to create a distribution of award amounts to empower students and faculty from institutions of varying size.
Suggested examples of levels of support:
Up to ~$60,000:  class project 
One or two instructors of faculty rank collaborating on a project in their classes.  Digital presentation of Veteran biographies is expected.

Up to ~$100,000:  community-based project 
A larger faculty team, working with students through courses and/or direct recruitment.  At this level, we expect production of Veteran biographies with digital presentation, as well as creating community-based events to showcase them, at least one of which must be at the national cemetery of focus.   

Up to ~$200,000 or more:  innovation in Veteran storytelling 
Faculty team of any size (3+) engaging students at undergraduate and graduate levels through a variety of disciplines or methodologies.  Veteran biographies are shared digitally and through other means.  Community-based outreach includes a formalized partnership with area K-12 students, teachers, and school leaders.   Innovation  is determined by the disciplinary context of the intellectual leadership of the program.  This can be artistic, literary, digital, cartographical, social, or educational.
For each of the above levels of support, VLP will ask Offerors to identify the primary disciplinary focus of their team, e.g. STEM, social science, fine arts, or humanities.  RFPs at each level will state that inclusion of the student-veteran community in some way will be preferred.


Expenses Covered by NCA
In the proposed budget please indicate in the proposal the cost for each of the items specified below.  Note that the following list is neither inclusive nor definitive of costs that will be covered; if the scope and nature of your proposal requires additional items than what is covered here, please include them in the appropriate section (see below).  
NCA will support the following: reasonable additional compensation for full-time university instructional faculty named in the proposal; indirect costs (IDCs) appropriate for humanities and Education programs (required to disclose); production costs for produced materials;  participating students, faculty and staff between host institution and national cemeteries, cost of workforce in direct support of program; transportation expenses for university students, school staff and students between host institution(s) and national cemetery; and costs for extended memorialization, if applicable.  As well, please include in your budget reasonable anticipated expenses for two team members to attend a meeting of all VLP awardees with VLP Program leadership in Washington, DC (or another city in the continental US to be specified later).  This Program meeting would entail no more than two full business days.  

Expenses Not Covered by NCA
Proposed budget can include any expenses directly related to student-centered events at national cemeteries. The following will not be supported by NCA: ordinary wages and benefits; instructional materials (e.g. textbooks); undergraduate or graduate tuition; acquisition of computer or network hardware or software not used solely for this work; food and beverages; video equipment (cameras, lighting, etc.); and clothing.

<DESC><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong>
<p>Call number W911W6-18-R-0018, Innovative Rotor System Applied Technologies, solicits 6.2 Applied Research proposals to develop electromechanical actuators (EMAs) and propeller/rotor technologies to support the next Gen UAS and future rotorcraft applications. Additional instruction and information can be found under the Master Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W911W6-18-R-0005 which is posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Scope of Research Effort</strong></p>
<p>The objective of Innovative Rotor System Applied Technologies is to develop electromechanical actuators (EMAs) and propeller/rotor technologies to support the next Gen UAS and future rotorcraft applications. 6.2 Applied Research will develop technologies that improve rotor system performance and durability will be matured to TRL 4 through component bench testing and/or scaled wind tunnel testing. Two topics for award consideration are being solicited:<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TOPIC 01-2019: Individual Blade Control (IBC) Actuation Concepts and Configuration</span><br />Next generation Army rotorcraft are envisioned to be high speed, highly efficient configurations. These configurations may have rotor systems that differ significantly from currently fielded systems. Some of these new configurations may require more advanced control and vibration reduction technologies, such as IBC, than are currently employed. Current electromechanical actuators (EMAs) are unable to produce the required forces and motions at frequencies required for primary flight control (PFC) and higher harmonic control (HHC) at the size required to enable the low vibration, low noise, and high performance IBC rotor systems for future rotorcraft configurations. Current IBC solutions are heavy, bulky, and require a lot of power which leads to thermal management issues. Furthermore, the reliability required for mission critical or flight critical applications has not yet been demonstrated. The U.S. Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD) desires to identify and mature applied technologies (6.2) that enable EMAs to reduce their power consumption, heat generated, and space/weight required while meeting the reliability, load, displacement, and frequency requirements of current rotorcraft for primary flight control and HHC.</p>
<p>Technologies of interest related to IBC actuator configuration, components, or materials include, but are not limited to, IBC system weight reduction (objective goal of 15% reduction), efficiency and power handling/thermal management, redundancy methodologies, actuator footprint reduction technologies (objective goal of 20% reduction), improved maintainability, and increased system reliability (objective goal of 5000 MTBF).</p>
<p>Offerors should define baseline for current actuation technologies and configurations. Define requirements for actuation concepts and configurations to meet the goals of primary flight control (PFC) and/or higher harmonic control (HHC). Conduct an actuation concepts and configurations down-select from a set of concepts and configurations. Conduct an analytical study of the performance and benefits gained by the chosen concept or configuration. Develop data acquisition and control software required to test the selected concept or configuration in a relevant environment. Test the chosen configuration on a bench or rotating environment at a relevant scale. Develop a transition plan for maturing the technology from TRL 4 to TRL 6.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TOPIC 02-2019: Highly Efficient and Durable UAS Propellers and Rotors</span><br />The Army has interest in developing next generation Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in the class 3-4 size range (approximately 200-7500 lbs). In order to support this, the Army has the need to further mature state-of-the art technologies used in highly efficient and durable UAS rotor system and/or propeller designs. Next generation UAS will likely require propeller and/or rotor designs and technologies that can operate in a variety of configurations and environments. The Aviation Development Directorate (ADD) desires to identify and mature emerging applied (6.2) technologies that could improve propeller and/or rotor efficiency, performance, and durability and ultimately result in increased and robust performance at the vehicle level. The Army would also desire to test these identified technologies at a relevant scale in a representative environment such as a wind tunnel and/or environmental (e.g. sand and rain erosion) test rigs.</p>
<p>The technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, concurrent increased hover efficiency (objective goal of 10% increase in Figure of Merit) and cruise efficiency (objective goal of 10% increase in L/De) that lead to increased vehicle performance (speed, range, payload), ability to operate for at least 1000 hours in harsh environments such as sand, rain, and extreme temperature, weight reduction, efficient and durable rotor/propeller performance in variable RPM operation (as low as 55-70% rotor speed and up to 105% or greater), and the ability to operate as a primary lift generator in hover and thrust generator in forward flight. Also of importance is a determination of the applicability of the proposed UAS rotor and propeller technologies to various UAS configurations (whether they be VTOL or runway independent) as well as to full-scale manned DoD rotorcraft. This effort should end at TRL 4 and include transition planning to move from TRL 4 to TRL 6.</p>
<p>Offerors should define the current state of the art for efficiency and durability in the class 3-4 UAV size range. Define requirements for efficiency, durability, weight, etc. Conduct a propeller design down-select from a set of concepts. Conduct an analytical study of the chosen concept. Design and fabricate electronics and hardware required for a test in a relevant environment. Develop data acquisition and control software to operate during a test. Test the chosen configuration in a relevant environment such as a wind tunnel. Use test results to predict the performance increase over the current state of the art.</p>

The data rate of the stereo digital audio pair shall be 128 kb/s and the data rate of the graphic slate content shall be 256 kb/s.</span><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;"> The Vendor is responsible for the aggregation of the BBG audio content and the graphic content into a unified service capable of being received on a commercial, integrated receiver/decoder (IRD).</span><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;"> A potential future requirement shall be for the Contractor to have the capability to receive the stereo audio pair and the graphic slate content over a Dedicated Fiber and or Direct Internet Access Network. The service is required to be Ku-Band and Free to Air (FTA). The estimated cost of the service for twelve (12) months of Base year one (1) is $126,733.08.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11.53px; line-height: normal;"><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;"></span><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The BBG has deployed &ldquo;RadioVision&rdquo; services provided exclusively by Babcock Media Services in the Horn of Africa and throughout Mainland China for the past 8 years. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11.53px; line-height: normal;"><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">RadioVision is a unique service which combines a stereo digital audio pair with a graphic slate, which updates/refreshes periodically. This graphic slate can include scheduling information, graphic artwork, crawlers, and news tickers, etc. RadioVision is superior to a stand-alone radio service due to the inclusion of updateable information embedded in the graphic content. This is a value-added service for our existing radio audience as it is published/listed with Television Services in a program guide/channel line-up or decoder channel search. RadioVision proves more economical than a full bitrate Television Channel as it provides the customer with audio and visual information at considerably lower satellite bandwidth and cost. The information that RadioVision provides to the audience can be updated periodically and will allow for the insertion of breaking news information. Babcock Media Services&rsquo; RadioVision platform is the only known product which can satisfy the Agency&rsquo;s requirements. RadioVision has been an integral part of the BBG&rsquo;s mission to provide accurate news and information to the Horn of Africa Region for the past 8 years. RadioVision is a proprietary technology platform delivering audio and graphic slate content and can only be provided and supported by Babcock Media Services.</span></p>

ORAP is requesting contract support to analyze the benefits and costs for Arizona to be identified as a state wide CHSDA. Tribal shares calculations will also need to be performed to determine the implications on Tribal Shares in the event that the State of Arizona being identified as a full state CHSDA. Tribal Consultation requirements are critical to determine how any cost shifts may be impacted in the budget formulation process for annual appropriations.<br />The Snyder Act provides the formal legislative authority for the expenditure of funds for the "relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians." In 1934, Congress provided the specific authority to enter into medical services contracts for American Indians and Alaska Natives. These, among other authorities established the basis for IHS and the Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program.<br />The PRC Program is integral to providing comprehensive health care services to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The Indian health system delivers care through direct care services provided in an IHS, Tribal or Urban Indian Health Program (I/T/U) facility (e.g., hospitals, clinics) and through PRC services delivered by non-IHS providers. The general purpose of the PRC Program is for I/T/U facilities to purchase services from private health care providers in situations where:<br />1) No IHS or Tribal direct care facility exists,<br />2) The direct care element is not capable of providing required emergency and/or specialty care,<br />3) The direct care element has an overflow of medical care workload, and<br />4) Full expenditure of alternate resources (e.g., Medicare, private insurance) has been met and supplemental funds are necessary to provide comprehensive care to eligible Indian people.<br />This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposal/quotation.

In conjunction with a diamond anvil cell the system still works down to about 830 &deg;K. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Use of photomultiplier tubes requiring power supplies with several hundred Volts is avoided. The use of detectors working in the NIR ensures superior performance.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Carl Zeiss Microscopy for a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope, for the Engineering Laboratory, Materials and Structural Systems Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The Engineering Laboratory, Materials and Structural Systems Division serves as the world-class resource for developing and promoting the use of science-based tools - measurements, data, models, protocols, and reference standards - to enhance both the global competitiveness of U.S. industry through innovations in building materials and construction technology; and the safety, security, and sustainability of the nation's buildings and physical infrastructure.<br /><br />The Polymeric Materials Group of the Materials and Structural Systems Division has a requirement for a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM-LSM800). <br /><br />The required system is an upgrade to an existing laser scanning confocal microscope to replace the existing aging scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) LSM510 Meta instrument. The LSCM system is a vital technique for measuring surface/subsurface morphology, 3 dimensional (3D) microstructure, and fluorescence using multiple laser lines. The LSCM instrument is the key instrument and is heavily used for many projects (internal and external collaborations, OA, consortia) in the Polymeric Materials Group (PMG). The current instrument was manufactured in 2008 and purchased in 2009. The manufacturer (Carl Zeiss) has stopped the production of LSM510 series around 2010 and no longer provides service contract support (no software upgrade either) since 2016. Replacement parts to this old LSM have been discontinued. <br /><br />Therefore, it is vital to purchase a new LSCM to allow for uninterrupted continuation of services and projects. <br /><br />Compatibility of the new confocal microscope system to our old system in the aspect of hardware and software is crucial. Only Carl Zeiss Microscopy's LSCM is fully compatible with the current hardware and software, due to the proprietary nature of the instrument design and operation. <br /><br />Carl Zeiss Microscopy is the sole manufacturer, and sells directly to customers. No other systems in the market were identified as being compatible with the existing hardware and software.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by July 9, 2018 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Telops Inc. North America (Canada) for a Thermal Imaging Camera system with built-in high-speed spinning filter wheel, for the Fire Research Division of the Engineering Laboratory (EL) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The Fire Research Division, Engineering Laboratory, at NIST studies fire phenomena that affect fire safety in buildings and facilities. To study fire phenomena, it is necessary to record high resolution thermal images at high frame rates and store approximately 60 minutes of thermal video. The thermal imaging camera system (TIC) will be used to record thermal images and provide quantitative radiometric data and temperature measurements of building components and electrical equipment such as cables, wires, current transformers, enclosures, cabinets, and circuit breakers.</p>
<p>Due to the large temperature range between ambient temperature, fire phenomena, and fire heated targets, the TIC needs to have a temperature range of at least 0 &deg;C to 2500 &deg;C. To spatially resolve the thermal phenomenon, a detector with resolution of 640 pixels x 512 pixels or greater with a 3 um to 5 um or greater spectral response is required. The time varying nature of fire phenomenon necessitates rapid image capture, with full size and full dynamic range images provided at a rate of at least 80 Hz.</p>
<p>Telops Inc. is the sole manufacturer, and sells directly to customers, an infrared imaging system, including thermal imaging camera, calibrations, high speed recording PC, and data acquisition and thermal image and video analysis software capable of providing the spatial resolution, recording speed, and temperature/radiometric dynamic range to meet the technical requirements of the Fire Research Division. No other TICs in the market were identified to have the resolution, frame rates, or dynamic ranges needed for NISTs research (firefighting, industrial, utility, manufactures types) or the quantitative measurement capability, as opposed to simple<br />imaging, used by typical law enforcement equipment.</p>
<p>The Telpos system is unique, in its ability to synchronize image capture with multiple filters using a built-in, rapidly rotating (100 revolutions per second), 8-position filter wheel. The Telops system technology combines the multiple filter images into high resolution - high dynamic range (proprietary technology to Telops) thermal video (automated multispectral image merging.)</p>
<p>The Telops system also has a unique, automatic exposure control feature. This allows the camera to adjust the expose time automatically in response to the dynamic temperature variations in the imaged scene. This feature is utilized in conjunction with a patent-pending algorithm for real-time temperature calibration.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by May 10, 2018 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Notice of Intent: Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) 880 Axio Examiner Multiphoton (NLO) confocal microscope
<SOLNBR>NIHES201800022
<RESPDATE>091018
<CONTACT>Onyenauche Washington, Contracting Officer, Email uche.washington@nih.gov
<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE </strong>AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; <strong>A solicitation document WILL NOT be issued</strong> and quotations will not be requested. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to <strong>negotiate on a sole source basis with Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC,</strong> (1 Zeiss Dr. Thornwood NY 10594-1939/ DUNS number: 038376674) to <strong>purchase a Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) 880 Axio Examiner Multiphoton (NLO) confocal microscope</strong> (with scanhead; 34-channel with GaAsP detectors, piezo motorized electrophysiology stage and specialized lenses) to support the Developmental Neurobiology Group (DNG) of the Neurobiology Laboratory (NL). This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516 "Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing" and has a size standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. Neurobiology is an integral part of environmental health sciences. Disruption of brain development and function produces life-long effects on human cognitive potential. The NL investigates the cellular and molecular processes in the developing and aging nervous system that increase its vulnerability to environmental toxicants. The DNG uses intersectional genetic strategies in mice to uncover the developmental and genetic factors that may define this phenotypic diversity. These investigations combine cellular, molecular, behavioral and physiological approaches to provide insight into how genetic and environmental perturbation of distinct noradrenergic neuron subtypes early in development result in increased susceptibility to cognitive and affective disorders later in life. The DNG currently uses a Zeiss 510 microscope purchased in 2004; however, the current microscope is no longer covered by the NIEHS multi-instrument service contract with Zeiss due to its age. Furthermore, parts of this microscope are not currently being produced and therefore cannot readily be replaced; therefore, any future service and maintenance is not possible. This is likely to cause irreparable harm to ongoing experiments since the instrument has been under continuous service by Carl Zeiss through a manufacturer's warranty and annual maintenance agreement. The equipment has proprietary source codes which can only be provided through Carl Zeiss and no other company is authorized to provide services on the microscopes either. The continuity of current experiments, replication of older experiments and ability to open old imaging data files is critical to the integrity of research at NL. The Zeiss LSM 880 is the only confocal microscope compatible with existing equipment (LSM 510 two-photon microscope) and software. Since the Zeiss ZEN platform that operates the Zeiss 880 is identical to what is currently being used at NIEHS, existing acquisition software macros, acquisition SOPs, and data analysis pipelines will be directly transferable. The system upgrade will allow the opportunity to integrate parts of the previous system. Additionally, the NL will be able to use NIEHS expertise in transitioning to the Zeiss LSM 880. The DNG is in need of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system with interchangeable sample holders (i.e., 96-well, 96-well Fast and 384 well plates formats) for an ongoing study on the role of brain neuroimmune function in inflammation-related Neurodeqeneration. The LSM Zeiss 880 must offer the capabilities and features described below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; A multiphoton (NLO) laser with sensitive GaAsP detectors, a piezo motorized electrophysiology stage, specialized objectives designed for deep visualization of cleared tissue. Versatility in usage with a piezo motorized stage and specialized lenses that permit the acquisition of large detailed datasets of cleared tissue. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Zen software/Zen Black tiles and positions module, in combination with this microscope package and specialized lens for the ability to combines multiple images across a large field of view; thereby, allowing for the collection of previously inaccessible datasets. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; An upright microscope and piezo electrophysiology stage for continued use of the shared facility in collecting electrophysiology and calcium imaging data while increasing functionality to allow superior imaging of cleared tissue through a specialized long working distance lens.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Enhanced capabilities/features for electrophysiology experiments and calcium imaging, while also permitting acquisition of large detailed immunofluorescent datasets of cleared tissue.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; 34 channel spectral detection, 7 laser lines (405, 458, 488, 514, 561, 594, and 633), liquid cooled GaAsP detectors and scanners, a piezo motorized electrophysiology stage, definite focus system, and specialized lenses for both electrophysiology or calcium imaging (water immersion, refractive index of 1.33) and cleared tissue (refractive index of 1.45). Zen 2.3 system software, workstation and 32" monitor will also be provided. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; XY scanning stage to allow for stitching of images to construct whole tissue sections and for imaging at multiple locations during time lapse studies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; GaAsP detectors to allow imaging of low level fluorescence currently undetectable on older generation microscopes and calcium transients. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Long working distance and specialized lens to allow for deep penetration of tissue up to 5mm, revealing datasets that were formally difficult to acquire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The ability to continue using as many of the previous components as can be seamlessly integrated. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The ability to reuse existing major components (Ti:Sapphire pulsed laser, camera, objectives, etc.) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Versatility of use needed to accommodate multiple users with diverse experimental needs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Features that allow for improved acquisition of calcium transients and live cell imaging, continuation of previous electrophysiological experiments determining circuitry, and the versatility to also acquire high-resolution large detailed tiled datasets from cleared brain tissue. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Allows for the continuity of current experiments, replication of older experiments and ability to open old imaging data files. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Compatibility with existing equipment (LSM 510 two-photon microscope) and software. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Direct transferability of existing acquisition software macros, acquisition SOPs, and data analysis pipelines.</p>
<p>To perform delivery and installation the contractor shall be registered as an outside visitor and access to the NL and Developmental Biology Group's laboratory space will be by NIEHS employee escort. The Government retains the right to unilaterally reject damaged microscope and associated components from the Contractor based on the requirements(s) specified.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within five (5) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Special Notice Number: SWFSC-18-SN08<br />Agency: Department of Commerce<br />Office: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <br />Location: National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), IT Division, intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), to Xceptional Networks, Inc for the deployment of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) technology that will integrate with the current Cisco infrastructure devices as well as the replacement associated virtual wireless Lan controller (WLC).</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) requirement for installation services of equipment from Xceptional Networks. They provided the enterprise original design architect that will allow the most cost-effective, secure approach to deployment, as this enhancement is a part of the in-progress VOIP integration. The current vendor, Xceptional Networks (Insight), has worked with SWFSC ITS staff extensively on infrastructure design and implementation and is in the best position to advise and complete the installation/configuration in a timely manner. They do not require additional time and resources to review details of the existing environment and will provide project planning, before moving on to the implementation stage. Therefore, additional costs would not be incurred as a result. The suggested source is the only source capable of integrating these systems that meet specific mission requirements for the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Fisheries IT Division. <br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract. This Special Notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing. Submissions are due no later than September 11, 2018 at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses may be emailed to Karen.Beck@noaa.gov or faxed to Karen Beck at (858) 546-7004. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is the Government's belief that only Xceptional Networks can provide the requirement stated above.</p>

<SOLNBR>N6883618Q0390
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Supply (NAVSUP) Systems Command, Fleet Logistics Center Jacksonville (FLCJ), FL intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Woodward, Inc. for TF34 Compressor Inlet Temperature (CIT) Sensor Repair Services.  Woodward, Inc. is the only source that can provide this requirement because they are the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the component requiring overhauls.  As the OEM, Woodward, Inc. owns all of the data rights, repair manuals, and part prints.  Without the OEM’s intellectual properties, historical information, and relevant data resources, the U.S Navy’s T34 Trainer Fleet operations, modifications, and repair will come to a halt and the FRCSE’s ability to sufficiently support the Navy’s aircraft fleet demands and requirements would be negatively impacted.
 

This requirement is to repair TF34 CIT sensors.  The services performed shall include cleaning, checking and testing, disassembly, inspection, repair, assembly and testing CIT Sensors in accordance with CMM 73-31-00, company internal build books, and other Contractor procedures to accomplish the mission in support of the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE).    

The applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) code that this work falls under is 336412 Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1,500 Employees.  This notice of intent is for information purposes only.  All sources eligible to provide this requirement must respond in writing.
 

Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide this requirement as outlined above.  A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.  If no responses are received, within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable items are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining this product through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.  Response to this notice is to be sent to wendy.colon@navy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to West Publishing Corporation for print legal publications.

The Contracting Officer has reviewed the requirement and determined that West Publishing Corporation is the only source that can meet the SEC's requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) because the required publications are under copyright and not available from other sources.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp; <br />The SEC intends to award a purchase order to West Publishing Corporation on or about September 12, 2018.  The total award value of the purchase order will be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and the period of performance of the purchase order will be 12 months.</div>
<div><br />&nbsp;
<p>This notice is not a competitive request for proposals. A competitive solicitation will not be issued. However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) intent to issue, on a sole-source basis, a firm-fixed price purchase order to Convergint Technologies LLC for backup cellular alarm system communicators for 114 SSA Region 2 offices located in New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico. Under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.
<p>The authority for this acquisition is set forth in FAR 13.501(a)(2). Convergint Technologies LLC has an existing contract with SSA for the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) maintenance of all field offices throughout Region 2. The contractor is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the IDS, system devices, and the panic/duress systems currently installed in all field offices throughout Region 2. Because Convergint Technologies LLC is contractually obligated to maintain and repair the IDS systems, awarding the installation of backup cellular communicators to any other contractor would be in violation of the pre-existing contract with Convergint Technologies LLC. Installation of backup cellular communicators to the pre-existing alarm systems falls under the maintenance and repair responsibilities of the contractor.</p>
<p>This requirement will utilize procedures in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with procedures in FAR Part 13. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement will be based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government does not intent to pay for information provided in response to this publication. Written responses to this Notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to Samantha.Derr@ssa.gov by 3:00 PM EST on September 12, 2018. No phone calls will be accepted as a response. If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Convergint Technologies LLC as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Respondents shall refer to RG02-18-1213 in their responses.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), has a requirement to purchase data loggers for the HMMWV and CIV instrumented vehicles. Currently CRREL is using a HBM data logger in the CIV and is only looking to upgrade this system with the newer technology from HBM. Purchasing the selected pieces of equipment from HBM will allow the government to avoid the substantial cost of purchasing, installing and troubleshooting entirely new non-compatible Data-loggers from a different vendor. This minimizes the learning curve to get the data logging system operational and collecting accurate data and prevents researchers from learning new software and writing new processing algorithms to view the data. The HMMWV data logger must be compatible with the CIV system so modules can be swapped between the two systems and so the same data processing algorithms can be used to view the data. This requires the HMMWV data logger to also be from HBM.<br />The ERDC intends to issue an award to Hottinger Baldwin Measurements, Inc.(HBM, Inc.), 19 Bartlett Street, Marlborough, MA 01752 (CAGE Code: 01HT4), on a sole source basis. It has been determined that the required purchase of data loggers for the HMMWV and CIV instrumented vehicles can only be acquired by HBM, Inc. due to proprietary nature of the systems. The award will be issued in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b). The NAICS code for this requirement is 334513 with a size standard of 750 employees.
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals.

<DESC>This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), 820 Chandler St, Fort Detrick, Maryland, 21702, to award a sole source contract to Charles River for a Endosafe Nexgen-MCS system for use in the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). The proposed contract action is for equipment for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2).  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i): Only one source reasonably available.<br />The Endosafe Nexgen-MCS system is needed to perform weekly QC testing to test water samples and product samples for endotoxin content. Significant labor and raw material savings can be obtained utilizing the reader, the cartridges and the Endoscan-V software. The Nexgen system is the only endotoxin detection system commercially available that meets the mission essential characteristics of the capability using disposable cartridges with pre-filled, FDA-licensed reagents.  These cartridges are the only FDA-Licensed and approved cartridges available. The system also utilizes a unique color change feature where the samples are measured and analyzed against an internally archived standard curve which reduces the amount of human error inherent in creating these curves.  If this system is not purchased, the WRAIR PBF will have to rely on an antiquated gel clot system that is incapable of meeting today's GMP standards for endotoxin testing (this test method is being phased out by the USP).An award will be issued on a sole source basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000.  <br />This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102(a)(6) and 5.203(a). USAMRAA intends to award a contract  no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Request for Information is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the expiration date listed in this notice, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the award will be issued as sole source. All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Mr. Christopher L. Cook  at christopher.l.cook68.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), 820 Chandler St, Fort Detrick, Maryland, 21702, to award a sole source contract to Home Controls, Inc for GlucoHealth Blood Glucose Meters with Bluetooth Technology for use in the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC). The proposed contract action is for equipment for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2).  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i): Only one source reasonably available.<br />In July 2018, the DHA/MHS Virtual Health Working Group selected the Mobile Health Care Environment (MHCE) system as the existing government system to support remote health monitoring at two Virtual Medical Center (VMEDCEN) sites for diabetic remote home monitoring.  TATRC is the execution agency for MEDCON for the MHCE system. This DHA/MHS selection meant that glucometers that had a proven API for data transfer to the MHCE system would need to be procured for both VMEDCEN sites.  At this time, the only Bluetooth enabled, FDA approved glucometer that has a capability API with the MHCE system for automated data transfer to the MHCE system's secure mobile application is the Entra Health Systems MyGlucohealth Wireless Meter model MGH-BT1-FDA.  The other requirement is that that glucometer be capability with both Apple iOS and Android OS devices; making this specific model number the only device that can support the mission.  In summary, procurement of another device would not meet the interoperability standards required for the VMEDCEN use. An award will be issued on a sole source basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000.  <br />This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102(a)(6) and 5.203(a).

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>1. Solicitation Number: W81XWH18Q0244 Date: 5 September 2018</p>
<p>2. Sole Source Title: Olympus FVMPE-RS 2-Photon Microscope Equipment and Parts</p>
<p>3. Agency: U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USMRICD), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010-5400</p>
<p>4. Contracting Office: U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD 21702-5014.</p>
<p>5. Location: USAMRICD, 8350 Ricketts Point Road, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010-5400.</p>
<p>6. Description: The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USMRICD) intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price supply contract to Olympus America, Inc., dba SEG, located at 3500 Corporate Parkway, Center Valley, PA 18034-8229; DUNS 017019618 and CAGE Code 1KN63. The statutory authority permitting the acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 1901. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) citation is 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), and the FAR citation title is "Only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, brand name or industrial mobilization)"</p>
<p>7. Background: USAMRICD requires Olympus America, Inc. dba SEG equipment and parts identified in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1: Required Olympus America, Inc. dba SEG Equipment and Parts<br />Part # Quantity Description<br />JW439400 4 Photomul Tiplier for FV30-AGAPD<br />FV30-AC25W 1 truResolution 25x Water Immersion Objective<br />FV30-ACCTRL 1 truResolution Hardware Controller<br />FV31S-ACC 1 truResolution Software License<br />LS-FS3 1 Labor/Travel (2 Day Flat Rate) for On-site Service by Olympus Engineer</p>
<p>8. Scope and Purpose: The USAMRICD is the Army's lead research laboratory for discovering and developing medical products and knowledge solutions against chemical threats through research, education and training, and consultation. The required equipment and parts will replace existing equipment and parts on the Olympus FVMPE-RS 2-Photon Microscope that have reached the end of their useful life. The Olympus FVMPE-RS 2-Photon Microscope allows for 3D in-vivo imaging of deep neural structures. A problem with deep imaging in brain science research is that spherical aberration increases when imaging deeper locations, making it more difficult to obtain clear images. Spherical aberration is caused by the different refractive indices of the sample and the liquid in which it has been immersed for imaging. The Olympus truResolution Water Immersion Objective overcomes this by automatically and dynamically compensating for spherical aberration while maintaining focus position, allowing for clearer and brighter images of deep neural structures. The photomultipliers digitally convert photons of light into microscopic images. The photomultipliers currently installed on the Olympus FVMPE-RS 2-Photon Microscope have reached the end of their useful life and require replacement to continue collecting microscope images consistent with the quality USAMRICD has achieved throughout the research protocol. The loss of image quality will adversely affect data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>9. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: The NAICS code for this requirement is 333314 Manufacturing optical instruments and lens size standard 500.</p>
<p>10. Anticipated Delivery Period: The requirement for Olympus America, Inc. dba SEG for the delivery within 30-60 days upon receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>11. Information to Industry: This Notice of Intent to Sole Source is for informational purposes only in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.201 and not a request for competitive proposals. Therefore, no solicitation document exists for this requirement.

<CONTACT>Call For Artists, Email callforartists@usmint.treas.gov
<DESC><p><strong>What is the Call for Artists and the AIP?</strong></p>
<p>The United States Mint is seeking professional artists to join our AIP via a Call for Artists. The AIP is a pool of talented American artists who enrich and invigorate our Nation's coins and medals through the development of specialized designs. AIP artists are:</p>
<p>&bull;Paid a set fee per assignment and earn a bonus fee of $5,000 per design selected for minting</p>
<p>&bull;Named as designer in historical documents, Certificates of Authenticity and promotional materials, and in most cases, have their initials appear on the final coin or medal</p>
<p>&bull;Able to work from their own studios</p>
<p><strong><em>Artists Answering the Call</em></strong></p>
<p>Artists who can bring innovative perspectives and who can effectively utilize symbolism to create original artwork that successfully conveys a particular subject matter should consider applying. The subject matter of the assignments varies across the programs. For example, some programs require portraits, some require landscapes, and many-as is the case with the Congressional Gold Medal Program-require images emblematic of the honoree's life and work. Many times, complex ideas and concepts must be conveyed through the coin and medal designs. Artists are expected to distill a program's design theme to its essence, representing these complicated subjects on a very small palette. Whether a particular AIP artist's work is realistic or stylized, artists typically use a variety of resource or reference materials to translate and interpret the wide-range of subjects and concepts into designs.</p>
<p>Although designs begin as an illustration, artists must think three-dimensionally as they create coin and medal designs that will be translated into bas-relief sculpture. Artists must take into consideration relief, depth, negative space, and the type of metal that will bear the design. The journey of a design from line art to a coin is illustrated below using the 2018 America the Beautiful Quarter&reg; for Block Island National Wildlife Refuge located in Rhode Island. To learn more about the United States Mint's Artists please visit the Artists page.</p>
<p><strong><em>AIP Eligibility</em></strong></p>
<p>To qualify to join the AIP you must be at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States; you must be willing to accept the Mint's Terms and Conditions; and you must be an established professional artist, defined as one who:</p>
<p>&bull;Has at least five years of relevant work experience, or has received specialized training in his or her artistic field, such as a degree or certification,</p>
<p>&bull;Derives a portion of his or her individual earned income from his or her art or areas related to his or her art,</p>
<p>&bull;Has experience in digital art techniques, software and technology (e.g. Photoshop, Illustrator, Wacom tablets), and</p>
<p>&bull;Has a professional portfolio that includes published or publicly displayed art</p>
<p><strong><em>Application Requirements</em></strong></p>
<p>To be considered for the AIP, you must submit an application containing a minimum of five and a maximum of ten samples of your work as an artist. Applicants are encouraged to submit works that display a variety of talent and ability. Please consider what is required of an AIP artist when selecting your work samples.</p>
<p>Following a preliminary review of these materials (estimated to be around December 2018), the United States Mint will invite a select pool of approximately 30 artists to complete and submit a demonstration design for an actual United States Mint coin or medal program. Invited applicants will be paid a fee of $1,500 for this work and will be eligible to receive an additional $5,000 (and have their initials appear on the coin or medal) if their design is selected by the Secretary of the Treasury to be made into a coin or medal.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>This project is intends to&nbsp;replace carpeting in two administrative offices on Building 1444 at Hanscom AFB, Ma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Offerors must buy carpet from a mandatory source identified in the Statement of Work (color and type included).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Offerors may submit one or more bids (1 carpet style or more) but each is a separate bid competing with the others since this is Lowest Price Technically Accepted (LPTA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;The quote must clearly breakout the cost of the carpet and adhesive from mandatory use vendor, as well as the installation costs (see attached Bid Schedule).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Installer should negotiate the best possible price with vendor but price may not exceed the NTE on the mandatory use vehicle.</p>
