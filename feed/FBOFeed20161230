The FAA currently anticipates the potential of three EFS contract awards, including the small business award, but as provided in the Draft SIR reserves the right to award any number of contracts or no contracts at all.  

EFS is a follow-on vehicle to the FAA’s Financial Integrated Support (FIS) portfolio of contracts, which have a current contract end date of September 26, 2017.

<SOLNBR>NASA-GSFC-WFIRST-SOLE-SOURCE-AURA
<RESPDATE>011617
<CONTACT>Julie Anne Janus, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 3012864931, Email julie.a.janus@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Science Operations Center (SOC) within the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). AURA will provide science system engineering, science system development, science operations, science research, outreach support for the WFIRST Project, and the WFIRST data archive via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to AURA.  The rationale for sole-sourcing this effort to AURA are:</p>
<p>1.	AURA's unique knowledge and extensive experience and expertise gained on some of NASA's most important facility-class astrophysics missions, including both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) &amp; the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).<br />2.	AURA's singular position to foster scientific synergy and coordinated science among three of NASA's most important astrophysics missions.</p>
<p><br />The estimated period of performance on this cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract is from approximately October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2022.</p>
<p>The WFIRST observatory is being designed and developed on a challenging schedule. The Mission Preliminary Design and Critical Design Reviews (Mission PDR and CDR),  as well as instrument and spacecraft PDRs and CDRs, will all take place during the planned period of performance of this contract. Only an experienced contractor that has thorough, state-of-the-art expertise in astronomy, science operations (including planning &amp; scheduling and archiving), optics, detectors, systems engineering, and public affairs will be able to meet the required elements of the contract Statement of Work (SOW) and meet the mission requirements within the defined mission timeline,  AURA is the only known source that has the sufficiently relevant experience and expertise to successfully achieve the international reach and challenging objectives of the WFIRST program.</p>
<p>AURA currently operates the HST and JWST missions for NASA.  Science program implementation and ground system design at the WFIRST STScI SOC (SSOC) are based on many similar aspects of these missions.   Although the technical characteristics of WFIRST will be different from these missions in that it will execute both pre-planned, extensive sky surveys as well as individually targeted observations (like HST and JWST), many critical planning, scheduling, and data-handling activities will be very similar to those performed on HST and JWST. AURA's direct experience and unique position to apply economy-of-scale synergies with the HST and JWST missions (also conducted from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD) is very much to the advantage of both the Government and taxpayers. AURA is in the unique position to leverage these synergies. The utilization of these mission-proven concepts, methodologies, software, and science-driven systems engineering approach essential to the successful execution of WFIRST's science. The reuse of their tools and expertise ensures that maximum leverage from past lessons learned can be applied in a timely manner, to minimize staff ramp-up and training. This is the only available path that optimizes the resources required in WFIRST's mission development phase and provides a proven path for immediate science productivity to NASA and the astronomical community.  This cannot be provided by any known alternative source.</p>
<p>AURA's experience covers all of the functional areas required to support the WFIRST SSOC in a more cost-effective way than alternative sources due to their previous experience with the HST and JWST missions.  This includes decades of experience with:</p>
<p>1.	Scheduling and instrument commanding<br />2.	Data pipeline, calibration, and commissioning of an optical-wavelength instrument<br />3.	First-class data archiving<br />4.	Community and science team engagement and support<br />5.	Scientific research<br />6.	Public outreach and <br />7.	Collaboration with project partners.</p>
<p>AURA's decades of expertise in the creation, development, maintenance, and use of state-of-the-art software for the planning and scheduling of observations for NASA facility-class observatories and smaller missions make them unique and the only responsible source for this work. This includes the long-term scheduling function performed on HST by the heritage Spike software that maximizes the efficiency of the observatory through artificial-intelligence-based suitability functions, but also planning tools for the astronomical community to develop detailed science proposals that enable the best use of the instruments. In this category are the suite of tools used on HST under the collective name of the Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT) as well as the new data simulator and exposure time calculator called Pandeia under development for JWST.</p>
<p>AURA is also uniquely situated to plan and execute the simultaneous planning and scheduling of wide-field imaging surveys, pointed imaging observations, and coronagraphic observations. AURA is unique in having extensive expertise with imaging surveys from HST, as the mission now spends an increasing fraction of its observing time doing surveys. As examples there are the three, HST very large, long duration highly optimized Programs that begun in 2010 which involved surveys: the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDLES); the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program; and the Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH) managed and executed by STScI.  In addition, AURA has unparalleled decades of experience with pointed Guest Observer (GO) observations (having operated HST for more than a quarter of a century) and in scheduling, processing, and archiving space-based, coronagraphic observations (between 1997 and 2002 three different scientifically productive coronagraphs were installed and successfully operated on Hubble). AURA's experience with the technical and programmatic issues related to HST and JWST operation and scheduling will be very similar to those for WFIRST and is unrivaled among other potential SSOC contractors.</p>
<p>No other contractor has developed and maintained the major pipeline processing systems and been involved in thirteen separate instrument-commissioning activities like AURA has done during and after the HST servicing missions. AURA scientists continue to demonstrate leadership in the field of calibration with recent developments in the correction of instrument detectors for the impacts of electron charge-transfer inefficiencies and image persistence (ghosting). They have cleverly sought ways to reduce the number of calibration exposures that take observing time away from science observations that might be performed by Guest Observers. Since the instruments on HST and JWST instrument share many similarities with the WFIRST Wide Field Imager (WFI), AURA's experience with these data-processing approaches and software programs is directly applicable to the WFIRST mission and will save significant amounts of time and effort vs. that possible with any other responsible source.</p>
<p>WFIRST intends to utilize the MAST to archive its data and make it accessible to the science community. Teaming with AURA will benefit the WFIRST mission directly from the MAST's large and growing infrastructure and synergies gained with the HST and JWST missions. AURA has unique expertise to develop, maintain, and operate the infrastructure specifically required to accommodate the Big Data and Survey nature of WFIRST. This includes the software, hardware, and network systems required to perform data discovery, browsing and access (including enforcement of proprietary periods), real-time alerts for transient events; cross-correlations and interoperability with other surveys and missions, data distribution, and support for running user-provided science-processing software on the archive computing infrastructure. These tools are not commercially available and would be a prohibitive cost to the WFIRST project to develop via other sources.</p>
<p>Community and Science Team Engagement and Support is another area in which AURA has unique experience &amp; expertise. AURA's extensive existing relationships with astronomers worldwide, developed through executing the HST science program for 30 years, is unique in both industry and academia. These relationships have been built through extensive informational interactions by printed newsletters and online websites in addition to frequent workshops, communication booths at American Astronomical Society and other commonly attended meetings, and in-house scientific colloquia. This position to engage and affect the astronomical community is only deeper and more extensive by virtue of their leadership role in both mission and science operations of the JWST mission. AURA's successful methodology and communications infrastructure is already in place to immediately support the WFIRST mission.</p>
<p>AURA is also uniquely suited and positioned to conduct and promote exceptional scientific research with WFIRST. It employs world-class subject experts in every astronomical discipline that WFIRST was designed to investigate. Academic metrics of astronomical publications and citations consistently rank the STScI within the top 10 most influential institutions in Space Science worldwide. This is reflected and confirmed by their representation on the competitively selected WFIRST Science Investigation Teams that were chosen by the Government in December 2015. Of the 223 scientists selected, 29 are employed by AURA, 13 percent of the total number.</p>
<p>In addition to the areas above that demonstrated AURA's unique knowledge and experience to perform as the SSOC contractor for WFIRST, there are at least four identifiable technical engineering areas where AURA's developed expertise from the science and archive operations of other missions will uniquely support WFIRST. These include: 1) reuse of software from HST (3 million lines of code) and JWST (6 million lines of code), 2) reuse of methodologies (e.g., the data processing workflow, database management structures, and recalibration schemes, etc.), and 3) leveraged new development (by staff with substantial previous experience, requiring little ramp-up time to start work).</p>
<p><br />Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 16, 2017.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>Engineering and technical support solutions for projects and programs within the Advanced Ocean Technology Program (AOTP) are required. The AOTP is a program focus of the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC), located in Port Hueneme, CA, and operating programs and projects at locations worldwide. 

The primary purpose of the AOTP is to conduct research and develop ocean engineering and naval architecture solutions in support of design, installation, operation and maintenance of both fixed ocean systems and towed systems. 

Additionally, the AOTP enables NAVFAC EXWC to apply technologies to assist other government agencies in both ocean platform support and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations, as well as search, location, and recovery operations.
 To increase the effectiveness of underwater work conducted by the United States military, the AOTP supports NAVFAC EXWC’s efforts and active engagement in an integrated program of technology and equipment development with the central goal of providing improved tools and work technique.

AOTP support solutions may require skill sets of naval architecture, engineering design, design analysis and review, prototype fabrication, system testing /integration, system installation, computer hardware/software development, technical manual production, and documentation. 
The engineering and technical services required by individual task orders issued under the planned contract may require skill sets in the following general areas: 
a.
 Naval Architecture
b. System Engineering/Integrated Logistics Support
c. Marine Geotechnical Engineering
d. Marine Corrosion/Marine Materials Engineering
e. Ocean Engineering
f. Electrical/Electronics Engineering
g. Mechanical/Hydraulic Engineering, Design, and Drafting
h. Software Engineering 
I. Marine Heavy Load Handling Systems
j. Environmental Permitting
k. Marine Research Design Technology  and  Equipment Technical and Logistics Support
l. Offshore Systems Installation and Performance Monitoring

The primary place of performance is NAVFAC EXWC located at the Naval Base Ventura County, Port Hueneme, CA. On-site performance may also be required a the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC, as well as off-site performance at contractor facilities and various government locations, to be determined by task order.

Special considerations:
•Task orders may require the contractor to assist the Government by providing a suitable vessel configured to perform ROV operations and object recovery operations and will coordinate vessel schedule and planning of offshore operations.
 

•Task orders may include exposure of information or equipment of a Top Secret (TS) nature, therefore, TS clearances are required for key personnel, as well as a TS facility clearance. The work to be performed is not classified as TS. A classification of Secret may apply to the work performed. 

•A half-day response time, such that the contractor arrives onsite at Naval Base Ventura County, Port Hueneme, CA or Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC within four (4) business hours from notification, may apply during the period of performance, at the discretion of the Government. 

•Government Furnished Property (GFP) or Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be identified as applicable to the requirement at the task order level.
 
The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services, under the exception of Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, with an annual size standard of $38.5M.

The solicitation will not be posted to FBO website. The solicitation, changes, amendment(s) will be provided directly to the Contractor via electronic mail.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for the supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, ESRI, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The basis for restricting competition is duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. ESRI is the only source that meets the current system requirements for Detail Geospatial production. This software is used throughout all the military services in multiple Programs of Record. This software is the main production software at the National Geospatial Agency which sets the standard for finalized products for use publicly and militarily. The Government does not own the design specification suitable for full and open competition or technical data rights in order to seek competition. ESRI owns all data rights to the ESRI software.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />Contractor must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offeror may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the internet at <a href="https://www.sam.gov">https://www.sam.gov</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />Questions or inquiries should be directed to Erin Wittmer, Code 0233, telephone 812-854-5908, e-mail <a href="mailto:erin.wittmer@navy.mil">erin.wittmer@navy.mil</a>. &nbsp;Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.</p>

<p>Notice Type:<br />Presolicitation<br />Synopsis:<br />Dec 30, 2016</p>
<p>The National Building Museum in Washington DC has functional issues with the dedicated chiller for the galleries. The current chiller installed utilizes plate and frame heat exchangers and is not suitable for the type of application specification to the National Building Museum. This misapplication has caused compressor failure to one of the two compressors on the chiller. Replacing the defective compressor is very expensive and will not resolve the incorrect application issue. It should also be noted that the second compressor will not operate under these conditions much longer and will eventually fail as well. The objective of this project is to replace the existing chiller with tube and shell type heat exchangers which is more suitable for the design application of the building. The work will consist of furnishing all labor, equipment, transportation, and materials necessary to perform all work in strict accordance with the specifications, schedules, drawings, and other contract documents.<br />The contract issued will be Firm Fixed Price.</p>
<p>The Magnitude of Construction of this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be available on or about January 16, 2017. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be available. Other methods of requesting a package will not be honored. This solicitation is a 100% set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220 - Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors and the size standard is $15,000,000.00.</p>

<p>D. Information:</p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>This is a new piece of equipment that will expand the capabilities of government scientists to analyze gene expression in cells with altered genetic states or disease states. The Single-Cell Platform is a molecular barcoding and analysis suite that delivers cell-by-cell 3' counting of mRNA transcripts for many tens of thousands of cells per run. The platform supports a broad range of applications, including cancer-cell transcriptomics and cell-type identification and discovery. Because the platform works with short read sequencers, it integrates easily into existing workflows. The Single-Cell Platform provides high throughput reagent delivery using a microfluidic chip. The 8-sample cartridge is loaded with the gel beads, a 3' counting reagent, a cell suspension, and an oil-surfactant solution. Reagents and cells are combined at a microfluidic junction where gel bead-containing emulsions (GEMs) are generated. GEMs are created in such a way that single cells are partitioned and &gt;90% of reactions contain a unique cell-linked molecular barcode. The simple workflow creates up to 100,000 GEMs per channel in a 10-minute instrument run time.</p>
<p>2. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The 10XGenomics Chromium Controller is needed for single cell analysis of gene expression. The equipment and supplies will be used in the combined NIDCR and NIDCD Sequencing Core for use by NIDCR investigators. The equipment will benefit the government by allowing scientists to use state of the art equipment to analyze individual cell gene expression in up to 5000 cells within one reaction. This is cost effective and lowers the cost of sequencing by multiplexing the analysis of up to 5000 cells in one reaction and up to 8 reactions/run i.e 40,000 cells. This is a new requirement due to advances in technology.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period.  The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2017 to January 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.

<DESC>Sources Sought:
<p>FY17 Sabin Dam, Boardman River</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Detroit District is seeking contractors for the FY17 Sabin Dam, Boardman River project.  The place of performance is Traverse City, Michigan.</p>
<p>The work to be completed consists of 3 major components, and includes installation and maintenance of erosion and sedimentation control measures for each:<br />1.	The breaching and removal of the Sabin Dam reinforced concrete and<br />earthen embankment and dewatering of Sabin Pond.<br />2.	Restoration of the Boardman River for approximately 4,150 linear feet from<br />3,550 feet upstream of Sabin Dam through 600 feet downstream of Sabin Dam. <br />3.	Demolition and removal of the Sabin Dam powerhouse, intake works and<br />existing spillway/gate.</p>
<p>BREACHING AND DAM REMOVAL SUMMARY:<br />Breaching and Dam Removal generally consists of:<br />a. Site clearing and installation of construction access drives.<br />b. Removal of concrete spillway structure down to approximate starting<br /> water surface elevation 609.00 feet.  Excavation of sediment from in <br /> front of spillway inlet to facilitate river flow.  Install sediment trap<br /> upstream of spillway.<br />c. Demolition of spillway concrete at 1' increments to elevation 598.5 feet<br /> to draw down the pond.  Dewatering will occur at a maximum rate of 1<br /> foot per day.<br />d. Construction of downstream river access drive west of the powerhouse.<br />e. Once pond is drawn down below powerhouse intake sill (approximate<br /> elevation 606'), installation of stop logs at intake gates.<br />f. Installation of flow diversion berm downstream (roughly 1,500 cubic<br /> yards of material) between the powerhouse and spillway outlets to<br /> isolate downstream river flow to the east side of the river channel.<br />g. Construction of restored river channel downstream of the powerhouse.<br />h. Installation of flow diversion berm upstream of the powerhouse to<br /> minimum elevation 604'.<br />i. Demolition of powerhouse to 4-6 feet below proposed river channel <br /> grades and construction of restored river channel through the<br /> former powerhouse.<br />j. Final draw down of the pond by incrementally lowering the upstream <br /> flow diversion berm.<br />k. Demolition of any remaining spillway structures at least 2 feet below<br /> final grade and fill to match the design plans.<br />l. Completion of site restoration activities including grading, seeding, and<br /> planting.</p>
<p>SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT AND RIVER RESTORATION SUMMARY:<br />Sediment Management and River Restoration generally consists of:<br />1. A large deposit of sediment has accumulated in Sabin Pond (Impoundment), as noted on the Drawings. The intent is to excavate a corridor through this sediment, wasting material in adjacent disposal areas as noted, to expose the pre-dam Boardman River channel. The average channel dimensions used for grading are a 60-62 foot wide channel top width, 3.3-3.5 foot (average) bankfull depth, and a total of 40 feet of floodplain in alternating widths between the left and right banks. Dimensions will be both deeper and shallower than average to account for pool and riffle development. Dimensions increase slightly in the downstream direction. All cut slopes are 3H: 1V (horizontal to vertical) unless steeper native slopes are encountered.<br />2. The sediment accumulation throughout the pond is primarily sand. <br />3. As finished grades are reached indicators such as the gravel bed of the pre-dam channel and stumps of trees along the pre-dam banks will help guide detailed grading as the old river channel is exposed. Additional restoration including the reinforcing of river banks with fabric encapsulated soil lift and the addition of large wood habitat may occur if budgets allow, but are considered additive items for bidding.<br />4. Sediment removal may occur under the most efficient means possible, including mechanical, hydraulic, or otherwise. The contractor will provide a detailed submittal of the means and methods for excavation and sequencing using the lowest cost and most effective method. The approach utilized must minimize the transport of sediment downstream of the dam to the extent feasible. Sediment traps will be used to collect material that will mobilize through the work area as an additional control to minimize sediment transport. Controlled drawdown of the headpond will also be used to minimize sediment transport. Some sediment is expected to mobilize and be transported within the work area and downstream of the dam as part of the project.</p>
<p>DEMOLITION OF POWERHOUSE, INTAKE WORKS AND EXISTING SPILLWAY/GATE:<br />Demolition of Powerhouse, Intake works and existing spillway/gate generally<br />includes:<br />a. Coordination with Owner for removal of powerhouse equipment and<br /> intake gate equipment.<br />b. Demolition and removal of powerhouse, substructure, spillway, retaining<br /> walls, and appurtenances.<br />c. Nonhazardous materials may be disposed of onsite, according to local,<br /> state and federal regulations. Disposal site shall be capped with 3 feet <br /> of fill, topsoil and seed.<br />d. Sampling of wiring and roofing materials for asbestos, lead based paint<br /> survey and an inventory of building components that may contain<br /> PCBs, mercury, chlorofluorocarbons, refrigerants, and other potentially<br /> hazardous materials.<br />e. All hazardous material shall be disposed of according to local, state and <br /> federal regulations.<br />f. Coordination with utility companies for removal power service and work<br /> around utilities.</p>
<p>The contract will have an estimated 400 calendar day completion requirement. The contract is expected to be awarded in November 2017.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, which has a size standard of $36.5 Million in average annual receipts.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE<br />AAC, Inc. - SS-CFPB-17-016
<p>The Fiscal Service (FS), on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) intends to make award to AAC, Inc., 847- Tyco Road - Vienna, VA 22182-7515 on a sole source basis, via GSA Alliant Contract Number GS-06F-0592Z to acquire Information Technology (IT) Service Desk and End-User Support Services. This service is for a bridge contract to continue services until GAO has resolved a protested replacement award.</p>
<p>The order will issued within the authority of the GSA Alliant GWAC which states that all contract holders must be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for all orders in accordance with FAR 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity in FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)-(iv) applies. An exception to fair opportunity applies to the order in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C) which states the order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>AAC, Inc., 847- Tyco Road - Vienna, VA 22182-7515 was awarded a labor-hour task order #TPD-CFP-12-K-00070 on 09/10/2012 to provide Information Technology (IT) Service Desk and Customer Support Services. This award was for a Base period of 12 months and an additional four (4) optional periods of performance of 12 months each. A decision was made not to exercise option period 4 and the contract was scheduled to expire 09/09/2016. A new contract was solicited prior to expiration and awarded. The new contract was protested to GAO, therefore, the previous contract was extended in accordance with 52.217-8 for several times through contract modification. The last extension is due to expire 02/28/2017 and completes all allowable extensions.</p>
<p>CFPB has a continued need for Information Technology (IT) Service Desk and Customer Support Services. This is a critical service needed by CFPB for continued support through a follow on bridge contract for a maximum period of seven (7) months consisting of one (1) 3 month base period and four (4) 1 month option periods to allow sufficient time for GAO to resolve the protest.</p>
<p>This bridge must be in place by the current expiration date of 02/28/2017 or CFPB will lose all support that is critical to daily operations and CFPB system administration employees are unable to take on these additional duties.</p>
<p>An award is currently ready to be placed once GAO has resolved the protested award. The intent of this Bridge Contract is to allow sufficient time for resolution of the protest and to ensure effective transition of these services to the successful Offeror once the new award is placed.</p>
<p>At this time AAC, Inc., 847- Tyco Road - Vienna, VA 22182-7515 is the only responsible source from which to procure the existing Information Technology (IT) Service Desk and Customer Support Services, particularly because they are currently providing these services and these services are required to maintain the daily operations of CFPB. Once the GAO has resolved the issue with the replacement contract, CFPB will be able to transition the provided services off of this bridge contract to the successful Offeror of the replacement contract. This bridge contract for the maximum time of up to seven months avoids interruption of services which would result in a cessation of a portion of CFPB's daily operations. Replacement during this critical time cannot be accomplished due to the protested replacement award.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the periods of performance for this bridge contract will allow for sufficient time for GAO to make a determination on the protest and allow for uninterrupted services during a transition period.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>FS will consider written responses received no later than 1000 (10:00am ET) 09 January, 2017. Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov Attn: D.Holbert / CGropp. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested services. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, FS shall make award on a sole source basis to AAC, Inc.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors must provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.). Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>2. A narrative description of how your services meet all of the characteristics of the services provided by AAC, Inc.</p>
<p>3. Whether your services are available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.</p>
<p>4 A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers your company currently provides these services to.<br /><br />5. DUNS Number.</p>
<p>The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>
<p>.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time.</p>
<p>This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Award Number:	AID-521-C-13-00007
<p>The United States Agency for International Development in Haiti (USAID/Haiti) intends to award a contract modification award to NRECA International, LTD. for a cost extension under the Pilot Project for Sustainable Electricity Distribution (PPSELD).  Launching a competition at this stage of the activity would result in a duplication of costs and efforts, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The PPSELD activity is the partnership between the Government of Haiti (GoH) and U.S. Government (USAID) to provide modern electricity services to the CIP customers and the Commune of Caracol with an expansion to other communes located near the CIP. The continued services under the contract will provide electricity services to multiple communes in Cap Haitien, Haiti; expand electric distribution infrastructure system; and provide training and mentoring the utility staff to manage, operate and maintain the utility.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting the award without providing full and open competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) that this authority may be used for an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>The award of this contract modification is planned on or before January 13, 2017.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may signify interest and capability to respond to the requirements or may submit proposals no later than five (5) calendar days after issuance of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed contract modification based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for this proposed modification.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (Oct 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on January 13, 2017. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Diana Romero. The E-mail address is Diana.Romero@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Diana Romero, (303) 497-3761, E-email address is diana.romero@noaa.gov .</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>

The program office now anticipates an RFP release in late December 2016 to ensure the release of a well-defined RFP. <br /><br />The Program's aim to refine RFP language stems from its participation as a pilot program for the U.S. Air Force's Bending the Cost Curve (BTCC) initiative. The BTCC initiative seeks to increase competition and find solutions that work for both the U.S. Air Force and industry. Program activities to refine RFP language, including extensive dialogue with industry, have taken longer than initially anticipated to complete. <br /><br />In order to align the production schedule with the Air Force strategic planning, the program's Full Operational Capability has been adjusted from Fiscal Year (FY) 2032 to FY34. It is important to note: the initial Operational Capability date remains FY 24. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">09 March 2016:<br /><br /></span></strong>1.

<DESC>Clarification to Solicitation Questions:<br /><br />1. The Business Questions posted for both solicitations are identical and titled "Business Questions - NIHAO2017059 - General Clinical Research Support Services". Were there 2 different sets of Business Questions that we should receive, i.e one for the Clinical Monitoring and one for the General Clinical Research Support Services RFPs? A revised copy has been uploaded to FBO.<br /><br />2. Within the Business Q&amp;A responses received, the responses to Questions 10 and 18 indicate that pricing only for sample Task Orders should be provided. Meanwhile the response to Question 26 indicates there should be a set of costs/prices for the sample Task Order and a separate set of prices/costs covering the IDIQ contract. IDIQs in general have no work or reimbursement associated with them but do provide a respondent's capabilities. The Task Order on the other hand has a specific task which can be priced based on the descriptions and assumptions provided. <br /><br />a. Please clarify if you are expecting to receive sample Task Order pricing and IDIQ pricing or just sample Task Order pricing for both RFPs. If you are expecting pricing for the IDIQ distinct from the Task Order, what is the work of the IDIQ? Our understanding is that there is no funding attached to the base IDIQ and instead the response is a discussion of capability, while the sample Task Order would have pricing attached. <br /><br />Offeror's are being requested to propose their Task Order Pricing as well as propose their ceiling rates for the entire IDIQ Contract. Please note that offeror's will only be evaluated on their sample Task Order prices. The IDIQ Contract ceiling rates are being requested for all proposed labor categories. This is to reflect additional labor categories that are not proposed in the sample Task Order.
<p>The ceiling rates for the IDIQ Contract must be used for the sample Task Order (i.e. no discounts provided on the sample Task Order when compared to the IDIQ Contract).</p>
<p>Note - fixed fee will be based on the proposed rates in the sample Task Order (should it be awarded) as well as proposed rates in future Task Order's.</p>
<p>b. If you do require IDIQ base contract, can you provide a level of effort guideline for pricing and how would the Government fund the IDIQ beyond the individual Task Orders issued? The government is not requiring overall pricing for the base IDIQ contract.<br /><br />3. The responses to Questions 18 and 30 indicated that a revised table was uploaded under "Revised Business Plan". There were two documents posted to the General Clinical Research Support Services page, a responses to Q&amp;A document and Attachment 8, can you please indicate what is being referred to as the "Revised Business Plan"? Please see the "Revised Business Proposal Instructions" - Attachment 08 BPI, which was uploaded to FBO for the revised table.</p>

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<a href="mailto:michelle.bailey@va.gov">VA119-17-Q-0017 Standard Manaul Wheelchairs for Home Use</a>
<DESC>Q.1  MTR #14 Warranty: We know that we need to provide a product warranty that meets the MTR, however on the RFQ page 29 there is a clause, C.8 VAAR 852.246-70 GUARANTEE that is essentially a warranty with no stated period of performance in the second sentence. Please clarify what is supposed to be done with this paragraph?  Should 1 year be inserted?

A1.  VAAR Clause 852.246-70 Guarantee does state that the period for the guarantee will be for 12 months.

Q2.  MTR #16 Order Form:  We assume that this requirement is to provide an example of the order form that the VA facilities will use to place their orders and that we need to provide proposed VA pricing on one of the order forms. What proposed pricing should be used in the VA order form? Should it be the proposed  base  year pricing?  Finally, should the order form with proposed pricing be submitted in Volume II, Attachment D or in Volume III?

A2.  Prospective Offerors need not fill in any information on the Order Form submitted.  

Q3.  Attachment C: Please note that another vendor s information is inputted on this document and this file is a pdf that we are not able to edit. Please provide the correct Attachment C.

A3.  A corrected Attachment C was included in amendment A0003 posted on December 23, 2016.

Q4.  The FBO notifier title for this RFQ indicates that this is a combined requirement for Blood Pressure Cuffs, Walkers and Wheelchairs. Please advise if the correct documents have been published on the notifier, as the actual RFQ does not have Blood Pressure Cuffs or Walkers and does not appear to be a combined synopsis?

A4.  Amendment 1 to the solicitation corrected the title to Standard Manuel Wheelchairs.

Q5.  Page 35 Quote Submission b. RFQ files:  The instructions are very specific and detailed as to the format on how the quotes should be submitted. As you know, there are numerous documents that must be provided to meet the RFQ requirements. This includes ANSI RESNA test reports, engineer drawings, FDA documents, Product Literature and others with formats/templates that have been established with protocols approved by Independent test facilities, Legal or other Regulatory areas.  As such these are controlled documents that cannot or should not be altered with additional labeling, headers, footers, fonts, margins or information inputted on them. We ask that these types of documents not be excluded and still be considered for evaluation.

A5.  All of the documentation that is submitted in response to the solicitation will be provided to the Technical Evaluation Panel as part of the complete submission.  

Q6.  Page 14, D. Terms, No. 3) indicates that the  contractor  shall provide discounts and price reductions to its current commercial catalog pricing. Please clarify if No. 3 is only applicable to FSS contractors who become a BPA holder/awardee?

A6.  This requirement is being solicited as an open market requirement.  All references to FSS are not applicable to this requirement.  The Contract Specialist has removed all references to FSS, however if a copy of the word is still within this document or any of the attachment, they are not applicable to the requirement.  


Q7.  Page 14, D. Terms, No. 4) makes reference that the BPA holder provides written notice to the SAC to changes in commercial contract related to items on the resultant BPA.  Since this is an open RFQ subject to open market competition which may or may not be subject to an FSS contract, please clarify if and why notification is required for commercial contract  price decreases , or is this requirement only applicable to those with FSS contracts?

A7.  This requirement when awarded will be a valid contract and as such any changes anticipated to be made by the contractor will require the approval of the Contracting Officer, before execution of the change.  It is standard business practices for business partners to notify each other of any anticipated changes before they are executed.

Q8.  Page 42 references range quantity prices and weighted unit price examples. On Attachment D, there are  orange  columns and references to FSS contracts and proposed unit price range quantities. Please advise if proposed unit price range quantities are optional or required for all FSS and non-FSS offeror? If required can only one or two price range quantities be submitted or do all have to be provided?
A8.  Column AQ, Current FSS Unit Price, has been removed from Attachment D Pricing and Product Data Amendment.  Column AP, Current FSS Unit Price, has been renamed to, Current Commercial Unit Price.

Q9.  Page 41b.i. PRICE, indicates that the total overall evaluated price will be the sum of the evaluated Firm Fixed Price (FFP) line items, with all options. It also states that the government will verify the offeror s calculation of the total evaluated price.  However, in Attachment D,  definitions and instructions tab  indicates that the Contracting Office will fill in the evaluated unit price and there is no column for total evaluated price?  On Page 42, stated in (1) under the example of how the evaluated price will be computed it indicates the offeror will not have the % weighting as those are specified by the Government. Please clarify who should provide the evaluated unit price on Attachment D and then the total evaluated price and/or ultimately to get to the total overall evaluated price. If it is the offeror, please provide the instructions on how this should be computed, the percentage weightings and where this information should be filled-in.

A9.  The Contractor shall put their total price in column AV.  Column AV was titled Evaluated Unit Price, and has now been renamed to, Evaluated Total Price.  The weighting in the solicitation has been removed.

Q10.  Attachment D: For future option year proposed pricing, we believe that different prices can be proposed to accommodate possible cost increases for the 4 option years? Please confirm?

A10.  The Contractor should propose their cost as they anticipate it to be for the option years.

Q11.  Attachment D: There are different estimated annual quantities for the Cane/Crutch Holder from base to some future option years. Is this correct?

A11.  The quantities for the Cane/Crutch Holder should be 150 each for the base and each option year. 

Q12.  Attachment D:  There is a request for commercial price.  We assume that this requirement only applies to FSS contract holders. If not please advise why non-FSS holders are being asked to provide this pricing information?

A12.  This requirement is being solicited as Open Market procurement and as such all the pricing that is submitted in response to this solicitation will be commercial pricing.  Additionally, all reference to the word  FSS  has been removed from the solicitation document as well as all attachment.  If the word FSS  has been inadvertently left in the solicitation document it is not applicable to this solicitation.

Q13.  Please advise which Attachment will be used to evaluate proposed pricing quotes, Attachment D or Attachment C?

A13.  Attachment D will be utilized to evaluate the proposed pricing quotes.


Q14.  The required fill-in information on Attachment C is duplicated on Attachment D. With that said, instead of having to create 7 Attachment  C s  for 7 products or 7 CLIN numbers, can Attachment D just be used in lieu of 7 Attachment C s?

A14.  Attachment C is utilized separately from Attachment D and is required to be submitted as stated in the solicitation document.

Q15.  Page 16, L. Delivery Requirements references delivery to the NG-MSPV locations within the Continental U.S. (CONUS) and Outside the Continental U.S. (OCONUS).  Please clarify if this is correct, since delivery cost (OCONUS) is much higher and would need to be considered in proposed pricing on Attachment D and/or Attachment C?

A15.  It is possible that a delivery to an OCONUS location will be required; however the shipping information will be provided on each order and shall be negotiated at the time of issuance of the order.

Q16.  Attachment E: Please advise who would be responsible to supply this reporting information and please define the following information on the VA s quarterly sales reporting requirements? Program Office Code, Station Code (VAMC), Task order/Delivery order number and Task order date?

A16.  The Contractor will be responsible for providing the information in Attachment E Quarterly Reports.  The particulars as stated above will all be explained after award by the Contract Specialist, Contracting Officer Representative and the Contractor.

Q17.  Page 9 Resna Standards Requirements: No. 1, calls for the literature and test reports documentation package to be provided in 2 formats, electronically as a PDF; and 1 hard copy in an organized binder.  In addition, on Page 37, a. Product Literature indicates that it shall be submitted electronically as well as 1 hard copy. Please advise if these required hard copies should be mailed to Michelle Bailey at the address listed on the SF1449 by the RFQ due date and if they are overnighted is this the correct address?

A17.  Yes the hard copy should be mailed to Michelle Bailey at the address listed on the SF1449.  

Q18.  Page 37 Technical Physical Evaluation: Upon notification, the RFQ states that a fully assembled wheelchair with required options be provided.  We would deliver assembled wheelchairs in boxes; however we assume that the VA would add various options such as front riggings, anti- tippers etc. Is this correct?

A18.  A18.  No this is not a correct assumption.  The requirement is to deliver a fully assembled wheelchair in the standard configuration including front riggings and anti-tip devices.  All required options must be clearly labeled, but not installed on the wheelchair when delivered. Boxed products will not be accepted.

Q19.  Page 37 Technical Physical Evaluation: Upon notification, to deliver product, will there be an opportunity to ask additional questions such as the delivery contact s email and phone number to make arrangements for delivery and receive a product delivery receipt?

A19.  More specific information will be provided to those contractors that are told that their products have been selected for the physical evaluation.  

Q20.  Page 38, Volume III in the first paragraph it states that the contractor is required to provide their certifications and representations manually or through ORCA. Our records indicate that back in 2012 ORCA and CCR information transitioned to SAM and therefore are no longer in use. We assume that the reference to ORCA is just an oversight and that we should just be submitting representations and certifications via a current copy from SAM or completed 52.212-3 representations s and certifications. Please advise?

A20.  Contractors should provide their completed 52.212-3 Representations and Certifications with the submission of their offer.  Additionally, the word ORCA has been replaced with SAM in the solicitation.


Q21.  Due to the amount of questions and/or clarifications necessary to fulfill the VA s RFQ requirements, we respectfully request at least a short 3-5 day extension of the due date. This will allow for the necessary additional time to prepare the remaining RFQ requirements, once we get answers to all the questions, and if still required a new Attachment C that we are able to fill-in our information.

A21.   This requirement has been available since December 16, 2016; the questions which are being addressed under this amendment will not require prospective offerors to make a make a major change in their proposal process.   As such the request for an extension of the proposal receipt date will not be made.

Answer: This requirement was posted on 15 December 2016 with an amended response time of 10:00 AM, PST on 5 Jan 2017 which results in a total 21 days. The government has determined this solicitation response time of 21 days will afford potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to respond to the proposed contract action.  
The above questions and resulting answers did not change the requirement as provided. As a result, the submission date for offers (5 January 2017 by 10:00 AM PST) remains unchanged.
i. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation RFQ VA101V-17-Q-0018 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The government anticipates a single (all or none), firm fixed price award.  The Government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order for the below line items to the responsible contractor whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, is considered the Best Value offer. Award will be made on an all or none basis. A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

<DESC>*** Updated solicitation (Rev 02) , 30 Dec 2016, expands CLIN / Line Item structure at page 2 for clarity of task-oriented billing.&nbsp; Note that there are optional items dependent on success of earlier efforts at seeding and non-native plant eradication. <br /><br />Due date is NOT extended **<br /><br />Recent wildfires have converted 30 acres of coastal sage scrub to catclaw acacia (Senegalia greggii) savanna with an understory of non-native annual grasses and forbs. The goal of this project is to revegetate this site with a diversity of coastal sage scrub species to provide suitable habitat for the federally threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica). A mix of native seeds will be used including California sage (Artemisia californica), California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), white sage (Salvia apiana), and laurel sumac (Malosma laurina).
<p>All restoration activities will be carried out by a contractor. The major maintenance tasks for the restoration project are overseedings, non-native plant control, and quantitative and qualitative monitoring. The plant palettes chosen for the site are comprised of native drought-tolerant shrub, subshrub, and herbaceous species that are anticipated to persist as mature plants without supplemental irrigation. All species will be seeded.</p>
<p>To reduce competition for the native species, non-native plants will be controlled by mechanical and chemical treatments for up to four years following seeding at the site. Treatments will take place at least once per year and possibly more frequently to reduce competition with native coastal sage scrub species. Mechanical and chemical methods will be used to reduce acacia cover and density, and herbicide use will be constrained to large or dense invasions of noxious weeds such as non-native annual grasses, mustard, and tocalote (Centaurea melitensis).</p>
<p>The success of the revegetation effort will be evaluated through yearly monitoring of vegetative cover, structure, and species richness. Due to the relatively long life-span of this restoration project, non-native plant control and overseeding would be performed as needed throughout the life of the project to maintain the overall integrity of the restored areas.</p>
<p>The effort is guided by two documents, the contractual Statement of Work (SOW) and the Coastal Restoration Plan 2016, i.e. "the Plan". The SOW takes precedence over the Plan.</p>
<p><br />C-1 GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>C-1.1 Scope of Contract</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform habitat restoration site preparation, native seeding, non-native plant control activities, and monitoring at a specified location within the Cleveland National Forest beginning during the 2016 field season. The project site is described generally in the next section and is specifically depicted in Appendix A. All work shall be conducted and data collected and compiled as provided herein.</p>
<p><br />C-1.2 Restoration Site</p>
<p>There are a total of approximately 30 acres which must be restored to the protocol specific below, all within the Palomar Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest. The restoration site is located along the San Diego River, east of San Diego Country Estates. All restoration activities shall occur at least 100 feet upslope from the San Diego River.</p>
<p><br />C-1.3 Government-furnished Property</p>
<p>Government-furnished property shall consist only of the following:</p>
<p>1. Maps of project areas.<br />2. Administrative passes and gate keys for the purpose of entering and parking on National Forest lands while collecting plant materials and other related activities.<br />3. Electronic copies of qualitative and quantitative monitoring datasheets.</p>
<p><br />C-1.4 Pre-work Meeting</p>
<p>Prior to commencement of work, a Pre-work Meeting will be held to discuss the Government's and Contractor's rights and obligations under the Contract. Those in attendance shall include the Contractor, Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs), and other Forest Service personnel who may be involved in the administration of the Contract. Nothing said during the Meeting shall be construed to change the rights and/or obligations under the Contract. Rather, any such change shall require a written order from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) N66001-16-R-0079 using full and open competition to procure services for maintaining the R/V Acoustic Explorer, a Government owned research vessel.  This vessel provides at-sea support for the Sonobuoy Quality Assurance Program (SQAP).  The SQAP is responsible for testing production sonobuoys, to ensure that the sonobuoys perform within contract specifications, prior to their procurement by the Navy.  The Acoustic Explorer serves multiple functions (i.e. Deployment Analysis, Defect Recovery and Analysis, Sound Source Deployment/Operation/Recovery, Environment Analysis, and Datum Determination) for the SQAP.  SSC Pacific contemplates the award of a single indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangement consisting of a two-year base period and one three-year option period.

It is currently anticipated that RFP N66001-16-R-0079 (will be N66001-17-R-0079 when released) will be released on or about 06 January 2017.
The solicitation will only be available electronically.   Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC Pacific "Open Solicitations."   Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available.   Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.

A draft copy of the Statement of Work and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) DD Form 1423 can be reviewed by viewing the attachment to this notice. If there any comments and/or questions on the SOW, please submit them via e-mail to Julius.limcolioc@avy.mil.
