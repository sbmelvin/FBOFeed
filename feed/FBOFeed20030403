Background: The need for generic biometric standards to allow efficient, effective and = interoperable deployment of biometrics technologies has been clearly and re= peatedly identified.  In response to this need, a new committee was formed = within INCITS (International Committee for Information Technology Standards= ) known as M1-Biometrics.  One of the first work projects being pursued by = M1 is the development of application profile standards for biometrics used = by transportation workers.  This task has been on-going for 9 months and th= e first draft standard now exists.  Additional work is necessary before fin= al draft is ready for publication.  Also a new international standards subc= ommittee, JCT1 SC37 =E2=80=93 Biometrics has been formed in December 2002, = and Biometrics Profiles are the subject of a Study Group within SC37. The key role in the development of a national standard document is that of = the Technical Editor.  This is especially true for ones that also are expec= ted to be an international standard.  In order to efficiently and effective= ly perform the tasks of the Technical Editor, the person must have the foll= owing knowledge, skills and ability: 1.=09First hand experience writing standards documents in accordance with A= NSI and ISO guidelines. 2.=09Thorough familiarity with the procedural aspects of national and inter= national standards development, review, approval, publication and maintenan= ce. 3.=09Knowledge of the current initiatives regarding the use of biometrics i= n access control applications within the various modes of transportation, i= ncluding: a.=09TWIC =E2=80=93 Transportation Workers Identification Credentials b.=09CDAG =E2=80=93 DOT Credentials Direct Action Group c.=09ICAO =E2=80=93 New Technology Working Group on Machine Readable Docume= nts d.=09RTCA =E2=80=93 Revised Standard for Airport Access Control Systems Mr. John Neumann of Open Strategies has all of the above qualifications. He=  was nominated and approved by the INCITS M1-Biometrics Ad Hoc Committee fo= r Application Profiles as the technical editor for the Transportation Worke= rs Application Profile standard and has been performing this effort for the=  past six months.  He is an internationally known contributor in the standa= rds community, and has held significant positions on both national and inte= rnational standards committees, including, but not limited to: - Chairman of ANSI standards committee for OSI Transport and Session Layers - Chairman of International Standards committee for Transaction Processing = within OSI Layer 7 - US Domestic standards committees for Information Processing (INCITS/JTC1T= AG, INCITS/B5, INCITS/B11) - International Standards Committees (JTC1/SC11, JTC1/SC23, ECMA TC17, ECMA=  TC31, ECMA General Assembly) Any inquiries for the above effort must be accompanied by a capabilities ov= erview statement.

<CONTACT>Robert Reuss, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative proposals for research on various aspects of distributed, large-area, flexible electronics. Key features of the desired research are that the electronics are integrated, yet distributed over a large area flexible substrate.  Such electronics may include passive elements such as resistors and capacitors and metal interconnects associated with existing flexible electronics, but more importantly, active circuits consisting of transistors and other components integrated directly on the flexible substrate. These attributes collectively define Macroelectronics and the objectives of the research to be conducted.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  1. Materials Development and Device Fabrication for Macroelectronics, 2. Process Integration for Cost Effective Manufacture of Macroelectronics, and 3. Analysis and Demonstration of Novel Applications of Macroelectronics.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-21 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The Macroelectronics program will consist of a Phase I effort (18 months) followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (12 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards are expected to be made during the last quarter of fiscal year 2003.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Robert Reuss, phone: (703) 696-2214, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: rreuss@darpa.mil.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 03-21, distributed, large-area, flexible electronics (Macroelectronics), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on the objectives of Macroelectronics BAA, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original hardcopy of the proposal, 5 hardcopies and 2 electronic copies (i.e. 2 separate disks) of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable each on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-21, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy _ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-21) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, May 19, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-21 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Macroelectronics.  The DARPA Microsystems Technology Office (DARPA/MTO) will host a one-day, unclassified briefing of the planned BAA 03-21 Macroelectronics program for interested representatives of U.S. Government and the U.S. technical community only.  The Bidders Brief will be held on April 25, 2003 from 0900 to 1700, at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, 2500 Calvert Street NW, Washington, DC 20008.  The intent of hosting a Bidders Brief is to inform the technical community of the government plans and related activities to DARPA's Macroelectronics program.  Organizations wishing their representatives to attend the Bidders Brief should respond via on-line registration: http://www.DavinciNetBook.com/conference using code DAR48925.  All briefing materials and questions and answers will be posted on the MTO Solicitations website (www.darpa.mil/mto/soliciations) for those who are unable to attend.  A limited block of rooms has been reserved at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.  Please contact the hotel directly for room reservations at 202-234-0700.  Room rates have been established at $141.

A registration fee of $50.00 per individual must be paid on-site or on-line.  Questions regarding the meeting should be directed to Courtney Brown (703) 816-5209, e-mail: brown_courtney@bah.com, Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-21.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.  The administrative addresses for this BAA are:  Fax:  (703) 696-2206 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 03-21), Electronic Mail:  BAA03-21@darpa.mil, Mail:  DARPA/MTO, ATTN: BAA 03-21, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

<DESC>Within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) plays a critical role in the safe operation of railroads in the United States of America.  FRA is responsible for:  (1) Promulgating and enforcing rail safety regulations, (2) Administering railroad assistance programs, (3)Conducting research and development in support of improved railroad safety and national rail transportation policy, (4)Playing an active role in rehabilitation of Northeast Corridor rail passenger service, and (5)Consolidating government support of rail transportation activities.

FRA's Office of Safety promotes and regulates safety throughout the nation's railroad industry. The Office employs more than 415 Federal safety inspectors, who operate out of eight (8) regional offices nationally. The inspectors specialize in five safety disciplines and numerous grade crossing and trespass-prevention initiatives.  Additionally, the Office works with, trains and certifies State safety inspectors to enforce Federal rail safety regulations. Today, the State Rail Safety Participation Program consists of 30 States employing 160 safety inspectors in the five rail safety disciplines.  

The Office of Information Technology and Support Systems (OIT&SS) staff located in Washington, DC has overall responsibilities for IT planning, policy, and operations.  Specifically, the OIT&SS designs, implements, manages, and maintains the information systems that support the mission of the FRA.  From an operational standpoint, OIT&SS supports the FRA headquarters staff located in Washington D.C.   The OIT&SS has a contract in place to provide Local Area Network administration and Help Desk support services to all headquarters customers (approximately 300) and each Region’s Computer Specialist (8).  It also provides remote back-up support for all other regional personnel.  

Currently on-site information technology (IT) support is provided to each of the 8 regions by 8 Regional Computer Specialists (RCS).  The RCSs are full-time government employees.  One RCS is located in each of the Regional offices located in:  (1) Cambridge, MA; (2) Lester, PA; (3) Atlanta, GA; (4) Chicago, IL; (5) Hurst, TX; (6) Kansas City, MO; (7) Sacramento, CA; and, (8) Vancouver, WA.

IT support for each of the regions is provided by the Regional Computer Specialists (RCS) who report to Deputy Regional Administrators within the Office of Safety.  The RCSs provide a wide variety of IT support tasks. Each RCS supports end users at the Regional Office and other cities in their region. Many of these users are safety inspectors who telecommute, working primarily from remote sites using laptop computers.  The RCSs also support Federal and State inspector’s significant distances away from the regional/field offices.  Currently, each RCS supports an average of 86 end users, with a minimum number of 65 users supported in Region 8 (Vancouver) and a maximum number of 122 users supported in Region 2 (Lester).  The number of physical sites they support (excluding the hotels that inspectors often use as an “office”) ranges from 3 to 15, with an average of 9 per region.  The RCSs routinely travel to field locations to provide training, hardware or software installation, and problem solving.  They average 10 – 15 trips per year; with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 25 per year.  Most of the field locations are in different cities, and many of the cities are in neighboring states.  

The FRA network is connected to the DOT network and utilizes its resources.  Client access to several Department-wide applications is also provided through desktop services.  The client workstations and/or laptop computers support Microsoft software for remote dial-up Outlook access.  Because of the inter-connectivity among DOT, FRA, and the FRA regions, frequent coordination between FRA technical staff, FRA service provider staff, and DOT technical staff is necessary to ensure technical changes and updates are transparent to the FRA user community. 

In the Regions, the RCSs’ primary activities, in terms of priorities and time spent, are end user support, hardware and software installation and upgrades, training and network operations and maintenance.  Although the RCSs’ work a normal 8-hour day, they are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to respond to problems that arise outside of normal work hours.  

The RCS must provide support for a wide range of hardware, operating systems, off-the-shelf software, FRA specific applications, and hardware.  In addition to hardware and software common to all Regions, nearly all of the Regions have some hardware or software that is unique to that region.  Regions 1 (Cambridge) and 8 (Vancouver) serve as backup sites for some Headquarters network and Internet service provider functions.  Because of the unique needs and RCS capabilities, some RCSs perform duties that are not done in the other regions. 

Pursuant to OMB Circular A-76, FRA is conducting a competitive sourcing study to identify alternative sources for the services currently provided by the 8 RCSs in order to determine the best value service provider.  FRA is soliciting competitive proposals from alternative sources interested in providing the required on-site IT support functions for each of the agency’s 8 Regional offices currently being provided by government employees.   A firm-fixed-price type contract, with a base year and four (4) one-year options, is contemplated. 

The solicitation is expected to be issued and posted within the next 30 days only on the FEDBIZOPPS system.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.  Telephone and written requests for the solicitation will NOT be accepted.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is required for resulting award.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to SPARTA, Inc. to develop advanced enemy threat discrimination and tracking algorithms and a state-of-the art decision theory concept known as Decision Architecture.  The required support consists of a technical director and integrator for the Decision Architecture, software developer for three of the Decision Architecture elements, and software developer for a variety of tracking and discrimination algorithms.  As technical director, SPARTA will oversee the development of the System Model and the Global Planner.  The System Model, or discrimination fusion engine, is an advanced mathematical representation of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that will enable fusion of sensor information from across multiple BMDS sensors.  The Global Planner provides BMDS sensor resource and weapons resource decision-making capabilities given the information in the System Model.  As the decision architecture element developer, SPARTA will continue to create prototypes of the System Model elements and the Global Planner elements needed for integration to the BMDS in Block 06.  SPARTA will also develop algorithms to support the development of models for forward based sensor environments and discrimination and tracking algorithms for the BMDS.  No other source has the required expertise needed to deliver the first decision architecture prototypes in 1Q CY05 as well as support customer development of the decision architecture over the remainder of the 3 ½ year period of performance.  The estimated cost of the contract is $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 during the period of performance.  See Note 22.******

The specific requirements will be described in a Performanc e Work Statement (PWS) released with the solicitation. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by the Government to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. It is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be conducted prior to solicitation closing; time and date will be provided in the solicitation.

The proposals received in response to the solicitation will be fully evaluated by the Source Selection Team on the stated technical evaluation factors. Proposals will be evaluated on the following factors: 1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management  Approach and Organization; 3) Technical Approach, Experience and Qualifications, 4) Phase in Plan, and 5) Price. The contract will be awarded to the best value contractor if the contractors proposal is more advantageous than the Governments proposal, taking into consideration the minimum cost differential requirements. To be considered more advantageous, contractor’s proposal must be at least 10 percent lower than the Government’s costs in the performance period. The purpose of the minimum cost differential is to avoid the disruption of converting performance of the commercial activity based on a minimal cost savings.  If Government performance is determined to be more advantageous, this solicitation will be cancelled and no contract will be awarded.  If a contractor is selected as the service provider, an award will be made in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and all other ap plicable Navy and Government acquisition regulations. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about 28 April 2003.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7), availability of this requirement will be limited to the electronic medium.

No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price i s not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award.

Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

Based on EPA's knowledge of the analytical instrumentation industry, there are features covered in the instrument specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  These features include: 1) specifications relating to system memory and design of the ion source and vacuum system; 2) the dynamic range of the collector amplifiers must allow for collection of signals over a dynamic range of 5000, corresponding from 10 mV to 50 mV; 3) the mass spectrometer must allow for true differential pumping; and 4) and the software must contain documented routines for corrections of measured delta values for 17O isotopomers of CO2, CO, N2O, and SO2. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Costech for the purchase of three (3) Elemental Combustion Analyzer Systems, model number 4010-400A with a carousel and consumables kit.  The system will require installation and training. Based on EPA's knowledge of the analytical instrumentation industry, there are features covered in the instrument specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  The Costech element analyzer system is uniquely manufactured to comply with Thermo Finnigan isotope ratio mass spectrometers.  The Costech system does not require a separate computer or "bridge" software to function with the Thermo Finnigan mass spectrometer.  In addition, during sample analysis, the column oven must be turned off and operated at ambient temperatures and the Costech system has this required function.  Finally, the Costec system has a built-in selectable oxygen system so that during sample analysis, oxygen volumes can be re-metered. This is not a request for proposal.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for 3-zone graphite heating assembly (1 EA) for 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit operation, designed to operate with existing proprietary-designed temperature and power control system.  Such system will be designed to uniformly heat a 2'x4' area using serpentine and machined graphite heating elements.  Heating elements will be separated into three (3) zones and supported by a water-cooled plate lined with UCAR Grafboard graphite insulation.	Power feed-throughs will be water-cooled.  1/2" NPT couplings will be located along the centerline of water-cooled plate.	Heating system will also include three (3) 4-port power feed-through assemblies for mounting onto existing NASA/DFRC test chamber, twenty-four (24) 20' long water-cooled power cables and six (6) replacement graphite elements and hardware.  Three (3) days of on-site, start-up service (including travel time), travel and living expenses.  Included in this requirement will be an option to purchase an additional system to power a 6-zone graphite heating system to be compatible with the graphite heating system described above. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the above items from Oxy-Gon Industries, Inc. (Epsom, NH) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The purchase of any other brand would result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This is a follow-on requirement and compatibility with existing equipment must be maintained. NASA/DFRC intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort (in writing) to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00pm PST on April 9, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Only written communications will be accepted in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

These areas include improved digital geospatial dissemination capabilities, permitting rapid dissemination of large data sets through electronic means; spectral technology, including the integration and fusion of spectral imagery and geospatial data in relationship to intelligence exploitation and support to military operations; and improved speed and accuracy methods for generating and performing digital geographic and geolocation mensuration.  This program will develop, employ and exploit technologies to provide advanced prototype capabilities for potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies to provide continued spiral development over the seven year program.  Objective:  The application of CI resources has shown great potential to contribute to the defense information and intelligence mission in the areas of surveillance and reconnaissance, mission planning, target graphics and product generation.  This procurement will assist the government in the establishment of a CIAID R&D Facility, a center of excellence, for technical development of CI technologies, supporting prototype demonstrations of these technologies, and evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies to appropriate organizations and systems.  These organizations and systems are expected to include the 480th Intelligence Group (480 IG), 36th Intelligence Squadron, Geospatial Product Library Sites, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), and others as applicable.  Technical Background: The Air Force and other DOD organizations have fostered the use of CI to augment various requirements to support operational missions for the past several years.  For the most part, the results have been widely accepted, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information production technologies.  Selected CI related processes have begun to filter into standard production operations, some of which are prototypes.  It is envisioned that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid CI technology insertion.  Innovative CIAID Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative CIAID research and development.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR CIAID WHITE PAPERS. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the CIAID PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Fred Rahrig, Ref. PRDA 03-07-IFKA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114 no earlier than thirty (30) days after the publication of this PRDA. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2009.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year, e.g., April, to maximize the possibility of award.  However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.  The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.  White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  Awards:  A single award in FY 03 for thirty-six (36) months at an estimated $7M is anticipated.  Details are:  Contract description:  Commercial Imagery Group Archive & Retrieval Support System (CIGARSS):  Create an integrated information architecture to support near and long term CI digital data production operations; Provide an extensible computing environment based on interoperable and standard interfaces: - NIMA United States Imagery and Geospatial Information Service (USIGS) - Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) - OpenGIS Consortium; Develop turnkey integrated solutions that facilitate integration and accreditation of emerging technologies; Establish and maintain the technical foundation for common AF geospatial data accessibility as being established by the Geospatial Product Library (GPL); Transition integrated solutions to Support Operations at 480 IG, AF/XOIRY, AC2ISRC, and NIMA.  The principal funding of this PRDA and the contemplated award is anticipated to occur in 3Q FY03. Subsequent awards will normally range from 12 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts, per award. Contractor teaming is encouraged.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA is not anticipated to exceed $17,000,000.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Deliverables will be advanced prototype software applications and integrated system solutions.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness.  In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort.  Experience with, and access to, CIAID migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work.  Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government.  White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Required GFI/GFE shall be specified in the white papers for evaluation.  No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary for a CIAID award.  However, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  As such, depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require facility clearance and safeguarding capability up to TOP SECRET; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for the appropriate access up to TOP SECRET SI/TK information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  Technical questions during the white paper development phase of this acquisition should be e-mailed directly to the Program Manager, Fred Rahrig at: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil. Questions and answers will be posted to http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda03xx/CIAIDQ&A.html within 48 hours after collection, thereby providing adequate time for the response. Questions of a contractual or administrative nature should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Arnold Kloven, e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  Questions will be answered on a non-attribution basis.  Questions, clarifications, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Arnold Kloven, e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  Questions and answers may be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities site within 48 hours after collection, thereby providing adequate time for the response.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:a.  Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.  Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and  c.  Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer within and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to issue a Request for Quotations under FAR Part 13—Simplified Acquisition Procedures for a pilot project to evaluate a pre-panel screening process for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals.  One hundred proposals in a specific technical area (to be determined) will be provided to the contractor for review by their technically qualified experts.  “Technically qualified expert” is defined as an individual with extensive technical business and/or academic experience in the area of technology, science and/or engineering that underlies the proposal being reviewed.  For each proposal, the contractor will provide three reviews and a summary of the reviewers’ findings and recommendation, consistent with the NSF review criteria.  See  http://www.eng.nsf.gov/sbir/peer_review.htm.  Of the 100 proposals, the contractor will identify approximately 50 that can be recommended for submission to the existing NSF review panel process.  The SBIR/STTR program will also submit the same 100 proposals to the current NSF panel review process, and will compare results to determine the effectiveness of the contractor’s screening process.  The period of performance is expected to begin June 1 and end October 31.  NSF anticipates award of the pilot project to no more than three qualified offerors.  The RFQ is anticipated to be available on FedBizOps and the NSF website (www.nsf.gov) on or about March 24.  See Note 1 and 26.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought survey only. The purpose of this sources sought survey is to identify firms that possess the capabilities, knowledge and resources to meet the unique and demanding requirements of the Navy Public Works Center, Environmental Department, Site Assessment and Remediation Division by providing site investigation and cleanup services at sites having contaminated soil and/or groundwater. One method of investigating subsurface conditions at a site is by using the Navy’s Site Characterization and Analysis Penetrometer System (SCAPS). The SCAPS consists of a truck-mounted cone penetrometer test (CPT) rig augmented by a variety of contaminant detection and sampling probes.  These probes are capable of being pushed into the subsurface to depths of over 100 feet, using a set of hydraulic rams balanced against the weight of the truck.  Some of the various contaminant detection modes include the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) probe, CPT soil classification probe, membrane-interface probe combined with direct-sampling ion-trapping mass spectrometry, piezometer probe, video microscope probe, microwell installation, and soil sampling attachments. SCAPS generates a real-time, continuous log of subsurface conditions, thus providing an advantage over traditional drilling and sampling methods to collect subsurface data. SCAPS push holes are grouted shut upon retraction of the push rods, thus grouting the holes closed from the bottom up in accordance with California Well Standards.  Additionally, the push rods are automatically steam cleaned and waste water collected and stored prior to disposal. All new push equipment provided as part of the SCAPS must be compatible with existing equipment.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All 
responses must be in writing and include the company name, address, tax identification number, Dun & Bradstreet number, Contractor Registration cage code, a point of contact to include telephone and facsimile numbers and e-mail address.  Please provide responses via e-mail only to joe.pechinko@gsa.gov by April 15, 2003, 4:30 p.m. local Pacific Time. Telephone responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to pre-qualify firms for a possible Design-Build Construction project for New Embassy Complex in EITHER Belmopan, Belize OR Freetown, Sierra Leone.  A process is in action to have one of these projects moved from the FY2004 acquisition plan to this year's projects.  The chosen NEC project will consist of design and construction of a Chancery facilities that will accommodate Department of State functions as well as tenant organizations.  If successful, the accelerated and chosen NEC project will include the construction of the Chancery and associated facilities to include General Services Offices (GSO), maintenance and warehouse facilities; perimeter security; vehicular and pedestrian access control facilities; parking; other site amenities; Marine Security Guard Quarters (MSGQ); and future office annexes.  The approximate building site areas, estimated building areas, and estimated design/build costs are as follows: Freetown, Sierra Leone: Site:  80,936 square meters;  buildings area: 6,135 square meters;  Estimated design/build cost:  $50 to $70 million; Belmopan, Belize: Site:  40,468 square meters;  buildings area: 7,460 square meters:  Estimated design/build cost:  $50 to $70 million.    Time is of the essence to design and construction of  these projects, which shall be executed simultaneously.  The government reserves the right not to prequalify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in all evaluation factors and sub-factors. 

THE CRITERIA PACKAGE FOR EACH PROJECT (Statement of Work) issued with the RFP will include architectural and engineering drawings; performance and prescriptive specifications; space requirements program; design requirements, supporting technical narratives, and preliminary designs for each discipline based on criteria established by the Standard Embassy Design (SED) program. A protoype embassy design will be provided to the D/B contractor. Design documents provided will require site adaptation by the D/B contractor. Project specific design direction will be provided by OBO for each projects site utilization plan; building massing and exterior elevations; interior plan layouts and organizational relationships; building utilities and infrastructure design for each NEC; standardized designs of major building systems and functional groups; structural systems; and mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems.
THE TYPES OF DESIGN SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED WILL INCLUDE, architectural; structural, civil, energy conservation, mechanical, electrical, seismic and geo-technical engineering, space planning and systems furniture integration, interior design, signage, security, communications, RF shielding systems design, blast protection design, fire protection engineering, potable water treatment and waste water treatment, landscaping design, cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering, and administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved.  U.S. Government codes and regulations, and the applicable laws, codes and standards of foreign countries will apply.  Building design submission shall use hard metric units (Systems International).  The design will be submitted in AutoCadd R2000 files in DOS format.  The design/build firm shall be the “Designer of Record.”  The design/build firm will also be responsible for completing the working drawings and specifications in accordance with the solicitation documentation provided. The contract type for each individual project will be firm fixed-price. Construction services will include construction labor and materials to execute the OBO accepted design; on-site organization with management of lines of authority to ensure overall project coordination; overall control throughout the life of the project.  Required services include required documentation submittals and institution of controlling programs such as: a quality control program, safety, construction scheduling, cost control, and projects closeout services.

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for prequalification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the prequalification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Evaluation Factors.  Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II.  The Government reserves the right to limit prequalification to those offeror receiving at least a satisfactory rating in all factors and subfactors.  If more than six satisfactory Phase I packages are received for any one project, the Government reserves the right to limit Phase II to the six best qualified offerors.  The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation.  Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design/build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design/build award will be paid $25,000 for each responsive project proposal they submit in Phase Two. 

FIRMS THAT SUBMITTED A PREQUALIFICATION PACKAGE for design/build projects of similar scope and value during FY 2002 and/or FY 2003 projects (Kingston, Bamako or Astana) and successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit their pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest prior to the closure date of this solicitation.  The letter must indicate they are requesting pre-qualification and for which projects prequalification is sought. However, if any changes have occurred in a company s structure, size status, or Design Build Team since the submission of the original design/build pre-qualification package the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable. Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for these projects.

MANDATORY PREQUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

FIRMS BEING CONSIDERED for award under this acquisition are limited to United States person bidders.  To qualify as a US person bidder, offerors must furnish evidence of (a) performance of similar construction work in the United States, including a United States diplomatic or consular establishment abroad, and (b) either (1) ownership in excess of fifty (50) percent by United States citizens or permanent residents, or (2) incorporation in the United States for more than three years and employment of United States citizens or permanent residents in more than half of the corporation’s permanent full-time professional and managerial positions in the United States.

<DESC>NA MARINE SIGNAL, SMOKE, MK131 MOD 0 DUE 043003 POC is Mark Dorr, (309) 782-7099 DESC: The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Marine Signal, Smoke, MK 131 MOD 0, NSN 1370-01-252-0318. The Navy uses this sign al for daytime distress signaling by personnel on land or sea. The signal is a one-handed operable device and is capable of functioning in air or underwater to depths of 15 feet. The signal can withstand depths of 200 feet without adverse effects.  A nylon  carrying pouch is provided to be attached to a swimmer’s belt. The signal consists of an aluminum case approximately 6.00 inches long and 2.00 inches in diameter. A molded plastic hexagonal grip surrounds the aluminum case for grip and thermal insulation.  The candle consists of 66 grams of red smoke composition, 2 grams of ignition composition and a MK 154 primer.  A lanyard is attached inside the carrying pouch and is connected to the signal cap. One hand operation occurs by grasping the signal and removi ng it from its pouch.  The lanyard separates the signal cap, exposing a plunger-type striker, which the swimmer impacts against his body or another object to function the signal. Normal operation with two hands consists of impacting the striker against the  free hand. The signal emits a red/orange smoke for approximately 70 seconds and is visible up to ½ mile.

<DESC>FOR INFORMATION ONLY:  Options for Lots 4, 5, and 6 are available to the Air Force to exercise under Contract F08635-02-C-0137, Sole Source to Raytheon Co. Tucson, AZ for Maverick AGM-65 H/K Guidance and Control Sections, NSN 1427-01-456-0081JB, and Maverick AGM-65 H Guidance and Control Sections, NSN 6920-01-480-6359JB.  Also included are options for follow-on training and support, data, warranties, circuit card assembly harvesting, and technical data package.  There is no solicitation available because the contractor owns necessary data rights.  Prospective subcontractors are encouraged to contact the Prime contractor.  This is not a notice that any option has been exercised or will necessarily be exercised but is merely a notice that they are available to exercise.  These options do not yet have specific quantities and therefore dollar amounts are speculative at best.  The Air Force has estimated the value of all the lots combined, if they are exercised, at $47 Million.

<SUBJECT>S -- Notice of intent to privatize the wastewater collection utility system at Naval Station Everett, Waterfront Complex, Everett, Washington
<DESC>Notice of intent to privatize the wastewater collection utility system at Naval Station Everett, Waterfront Complex, Everett, Washington pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2688, as a sole source procurement with the local utility provider, the City of Everett. The Government's intent is to convey the utility system and award a long-term firm fixed price utility services contract. On 27 Sep 2002, a Request for Proposal, N44255-01-R-8003, was issued as a competitive procurement to privatize this system. Proposals were due on 31 Mar 2003. No proposals were received in response to Request for Proposal, N44255-01-R-8003. In accordance with Department of Defense Guidance for Privatizing Defense Utility Systems issued on 09 Oct 2002, the local utility provider, the City of Everett, was contacted to determine if the City of Everett would be interested in entering into an agreement with the Navy to privatize the wastewater collection system at Naval Station Everett, Waterfront Complex, Everett, Washington. As this procurement will now be a non-competitive action, this sole source negotiation will be accomplished under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, which allows for the use of other than competitive source selection procedures when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is to provide any other parties an opportunity to indicate an interest in the privatization of this utility system. All responses must be received within thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. No contract will be awarded on the basis of information received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a qualified comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government in a future procurement. If no acceptable interest is received, the Navy shall conclude that the only entity that can, as a practical matter, enter into an agreement to privatize the wastewater collection system at Naval Station Everett, Waterfront Complex, Everett, Washington, is the City of Everett. Responses to this notice as well as any questions should be directed to: Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFANW), Attention Patrick Donnelly, Contracting Officer, 19917 7th Avenue NE, Poulsbo, WA 98370-7570.
