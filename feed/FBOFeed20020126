The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center (DSC), 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado, 80228, is seeking a qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Civil, Environmental, and Sanitary Architect/Engineer (A/E) services under an Indefinite Quantity contract for a variety of projects within areas of national significance at locations throughout the continental United States, also including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Government may elect to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued.  The Government will use such factors as experience, qualifications, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, geographic location, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgement, believes are relevant to the placement of orders.  TYPES OF PROJECTS: Projects may include, but are not limited to:  A.  Water supply, treatment, distribution, and storage systems;  B. Wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal facilities; C.  Wastewater reclamation and reuse (both potable and nonpotable facilities); D. Water and wastewater pumping facilities.  As an example of the size of projects for Parts A through D, the size will range from very small (5,000 gallons per day capacity) to larger (over one million gallons per day capacity).  Complexity will range from that of groundwater wells with disinfection to complete treatment facilities for surface water sources, or desalination, and from that of on-site septic tank/drainfield systems to wetlands, lagoons, alternative and/or advanced wastewater treatment processes, and conventional wastewater treatment facilities.  Projects will also include, but are not limited to: E.  Surveying may include, but is not limited to, ground surveys, boundary surveys, aerial photography and aerial topographic surveys, global positioning systems (GPS) surveys, preliminary and final design layouts, construction layouts, as-built surveys, hydrographic and hydrologic surveys, and technical assistance;  F. Drainage and stormwater management systems; G.

REQUIRED DISCIPLINES: Required disciplines include professionals registered as Civil Engineers,  Environmental Engineers, and Sanitary Engineers. Other disciplines which may be required for some projects include professionals registered in traffic, structural, electrical, mechanical, hydrologic, fire/safety, and process/instrumentation engineering; surveyors; geotechnical engineering; architecture; landscape architecture; and cost control/estimating.  Incidental services, e.g. AutoCAD drafting, word processing, cost estimating, etc. may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.  CONTRACT PERIOD:  All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract.  The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $10,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.  Each task order will not exceed $500,000.00.  The $10,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN:  The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.   Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and membership in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices.  EXECUTIVE ORDER: In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract.  PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED: For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily Pre-Design, Compliance, and Supplemental Services (Title I Services), Design and Construction Documents (Title II Services), and Construction Management (Title III Services).  All work and deliverables shall be stamped and sealed by Registered Professionals.  The professionals shall be registered in the States in which the construction  work is to be performed.  Title I Services:   Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of conceptual, schematic, and preliminary design documents.  This may include site and feasibility investigations; laboratory testing; surveying; geotechnical studies; investigation and analysis of existing systems; research and analysis of pertinent Federal, State, and local regulations and codes; permitting; value analysis (engineering) and preliminary design, including alternatives analysis, schematic design and design development; preliminary drawings; and value and design analysis, including acquisition of data pertaining to local construction practices and material availability, outline specifications, and preliminary construction cost estimates; comparability cost analysis; NEPA and Section 106 Compliance; and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Title II Services:  Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of  design development documents, construction drawings, and construction specifications and preparation of construction cost estimates for civil/environmental/sanitary engineering projects, including repair, rehabilitation and modification of existing buildings, roads with associated parking, and utility systems; and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Title III Services:  Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, construction management services, which include management from construction contract award to final acceptance of actions required to complete the proposed facility including the warranty period.  This includes construction observation, review of submittals, value engineering, site visits, field-testing, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, construction support, and consultation during construction.  Much of the work to be performed in historic buildings and sites will require continuous attention to compliance with historic preservation guidelines, techniques, and oversight.  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with federal, state or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance.  SPECIALIZED SERVICES: In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the  ceiling amounts and the effect these “pass-throughs” would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  (1)  Demonstrated professional qualifications, professional registration, technical expertise, and experience of the firm, including all principles and key staff of the firm, its consultants, and project personnel, with projects of types described both in urban and remote locations.

Each Task Order will not exceed $250,000.00.  The $5,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES:  The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.   Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and membership in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices.  The National Park Service, Pacific West Region has implemented Directive PW-048 which delineates how it emphasizes the concept of sustainability with respect to design and construction practices. Implementing sustainable design and construction practices is the constant process of identifying and incorporating activities and actions during facility planning, design, construction, and operation to meet the following goals:  a.  Consume less energy and natural resources over the life of the facility; b.  Ensure that resources such as water, air and land are as clean or cleaner at the end of use as at the beginning; c.  Ensure that the viability, integrity and diversity of natural systems are protected, undiminished and maintained; d.  Ensure that natural sound-scape and dark skies are undiminished; e.  Use green technologies and products that have less negative impacts on human health and the environment;  f.  Reduce the material entering landfills; and g.  Ensure compliance with all natural and cultural requirements.  EXECUTIVE ORDERS:  In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract. Executive Order 13101 – Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition,” (September 14, 1998).  This Executive Order requires Federal Agencies to incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the Agency’s operation and work to increase and expand markets for recovered materials through greater Federal Government preference and demand for such products.  In developing work plans, work statements and specifications, Agencies must consider the “elimination of virgin materials requirements, use of bio-based products, use of recovered materials, reuse of product, lifecycle cost and lifecycle assessment, recycle ability, use of environmental preferable products, waste prevention and ultimate disposal.”  The Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), Section 6002 and Executive Order 13101 require the purchase of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated products with a required minimum recovered material content as described in an Agency’s Affirmative Procurement Program (APP).  This list of EPA-designated products is available at http://www.epa.gov/cpg.  This requirement applies to all contracts that require EPA-designated products.  When purchasing a product or products on this list without the required minimum recovered minimum recovered material content, a written justification based on specific exemptions is required by FAR 23.405 ( c)  A/E firms and their consultants are required to be familiar with EPA guidelines by developing specifications utilizing EPA’s minimum recycled content standards.  If products specified by the A/E do not meet EPA’s guidelines, the A/E must prepare written justifications in accordance with FAR 23.405 (c ).   A/E firms are to use life-cycle cost analysis, wherever feasible and appropriate to assist selection of products and services.  Whenever possible, cost shall be calculated over the life of the item, not just the initial, up-front cost.  When comparing alternative products, the initial cost of the acquisition as well as maintenance costs, operational costs, etc., must be considered in the analysis.  A product having a higher initial cost may have lower operational costs or higher resale value and will, therefore, prove to be a better value and more cost effective compared to the alternatives.  PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED: For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily Pre-Design, Compliance, and Supplemental Services (Title I Services), Design and Construction Documents (Title II Services), and Construction Management (Title III Services).  All work and deliverables shall be stamped and sealed by Registered Professionals.  All professionals shall be registered in the States in which the work is performed.   Title I Services:    Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of conceptual, schematic, and preliminary design documents.  This may include site and feasibility investigations; laboratory testing; pilot testing of water treatment systems; surveying; geotechnical studies; drilling of test/pilot wells; investigation and analysis of existing systems; research and analysis of pertinent Federal, State, and local regulations and codes; permitting; value analysis (engineering) and preliminary design, including alternatives analysis, schematic design and design development; preliminary drawings; and value and design analysis, including acquisition of data pertaining to local construction practices and material availability, outline specifications, and preliminary construction cost estimates; comparability cost analysis; NEPA and Section 106 Compliance; and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Title II Services: Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, the preparation of  design development documents, construction drawings, and construction specifications and preparation of construction cost estimates for civil/environmental engineering projects, including repair, rehabilitation and modification of existing buildings, roads with associated parking, and utility systems; and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Final construction documents (i.e., plans and specifications) shall be furnished to the NPS in an electronic format capable of being transmitted over the Internet to the general public via electronic commerce.  Title III Services:  Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, construction management services, which include management from construction contract award to final acceptance of actions required to complete the proposed facility including the warranty period.  This includes construction observation, review of submittals, value engineering, site visits, field-testing, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, construction support, and consultation during construction.  Much of the work to be performed in historic buildings and sites will require continuous attention to compliance with historic preservation guidelines, techniques, and oversight.  COORDINATION:  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants.  The A/E will need to have direct contact with federal, state or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  A.  Demonstrated professional qualifications, professional registration, technical expertise, and experience of the firm, including all principles and key staff of the firm, its consultants, and project personnel, with projects of types described both in urban and remote locations.

Demonstrated experience and expertise in other technical aspects required under this contract, including construction management, drainage and stormwater management systems, environmental engineering and compliance, permitting, NEPA and Section 106 compliance, surveying, and geotechnical engineering, either in-house or by multidisciplinary teams and sub-consultants. Demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in preparing, developing, and finalizing designs for facilities that minimize the use of, and the environmental impact on, the earth's renewable and non-renewable resources (water and electric conservation, solar energy, wind energy, etc.) and to the earth’s managed resources.  This includes to the maximum extent practicable, specifying the use of recycled content material and recovered materials, and providing designs for construction that promote energy conservation, pollution prevention, and waste reduction.  D.  Demonstrated good judgment in selection of treatment processes, that are appropriate for level of staffing, remoteness of facility, extreme climatic conditions, and other factors.  E.  Specific past performance on previous architect/engineering work performed for federal, state, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets.   F.  Demonstrated capacity to respond to short time frames and accomplish multiple simultaneous projects within desired schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality of work and cost control.   When responding to this announcement, firms should fully address their capability, capacity and qualifications with regard to each of the foregoing evaluation factors.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 19.10) and is therefore open to both small and large business concerns. Small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.   SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENT:  In accordance with Public Law 97-507, the A/E Firm will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for this contract are that a minimum of 15% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small business, 5% shall be placed with women-owned businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, and 3% to be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal;  however, contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES:  In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the  ceiling amounts and the effect these “pass-throughs” would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms wishing to be considered must submit completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255 and other PERTINENT information. Pertinent information submitted in support of the completed SF 254’s and 255’s should not exceed 15 pages.  SF 254’s and 255's must also be submitted for subconsultants.

<SUBJECT>B--Environmental Investigation of the Use of Shoals Offshore Delaware and Maryland by Mobile Benthos and Finfish Species
<SOLNBR>85060
<RESPDATE>021302
<ARCHDATE>03132002
<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, intends to competitively award a contract to  conduct a study to address environmental questions concerning the use of  offshore shoal areas of the mid-Atlantic by finfish and other mobile species  and the potential for adverse impacts to these species as a result of  offshore sand dredging. MMS has formed partnerships with several East Coast  and Gulf of Mexico States to evaluate sand deposits along their coast for  restoration projects. The MMS has for several years worked with the States of  Maryland and Delaware through their respective geological surveys to locate  potential sand borrow areas in the Federal waters offshore their respective  coasts. This has resulted in the identification of numerous shoals, some of  which have been found to contain compatible sand for coastal and beach  restoration purposes. However, numerous species of fish and other mobile  organisms are known to inhabit these shoal areas and the potential for  long-term adverse impact associated with an offshore dredging operation does  exist if the dredging operation were to result in a significantly altered  physiography/topography. The information gathered during this project will be  used to assess requests for the use of OCS sand from the States of Maryland  or Delaware, or from local entities within those States. The information will  assist the MMS during the EFH consultation process and identify ways to  minimize or preclude the impact of dredging operations. BACKGROUND: The  United States (U. S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management  Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has  jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal OCS. Public Law  103-426, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the  rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or  wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in  whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government. Since enactment of PL  103-426, MMS has provided Federal sand for beach nourishment projects in New  Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Florida. Extensive beach restoration projects  along the east and Gulf coasts of the U. S. are placing increased pressure on  known offshore sand resources within state waters. Resource studies in  Federal waters conducted to date suggest that most usable sand deposits for  coastal and beach restoration occur within the submerged offshore shoals on  the inner continental shelf. The 1996 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Act  strengthened the ability of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and  Fishery Management Councils to protect and conserve the habitat of marine,  estuarine, and anadromous finfish, mollusks, and crustaceans. This habitat is  termed "essential fish habitat" and is broadly defined to include "those  waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or  growth to maturity". The Act requires the Councils to describe and identify  the essential habitat for the managed species, minimize to the extent  practicable adverse effects on EFH caused by fishing, and identify other  actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH. NMFS must  coordinate with other federal agencies to conserve and enhance EFH, and  federal agencies must consult with NMFS on all actions or proposed actions  authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency that may adversely affect  EFH. NMFS must provide recommendations to federal and state agencies on such  activities to conserve EFH. MMS has actively worked with the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers and NMFS during project/negotiated lease development and the EFH  consultation process using whatever information is currently available to  avoid impacts to various fish species in shoal areas proposed as sand borrow  sites. Little information is available, however, relative to the use of these  offshore shoal areas by fish and various mobile species. STATEMENT OF WORK:  ITEM 1. Development of Technical Field Program to Address Biological  Questions Concerning the Relationship of/and Use of Offshore Shoal Areas by  Finfish and Other Mobile Species (Task 1):  The Contractor will develop a  field program to provide information relative to the following questions and  issues: Due the shoals located on the mid-Atlantic seafloor:  1) serve as  orientation features for finfish and mobile epi-benthos to orient to during  migrations or other population movements; 2) serve as a staging ground for  various species of finfish and mobile epi-benthos during migrations or other  population movements; 3) provide needed physical habitat structure for a  variety of marine species, (this structure would otherwise be lacking on the  largely flat seafloor); 4) serve to maintain physical habitat diversity by  contributing to maintenance of adjacent lows and seafloor flats. The field  program is to be conducted in and around Fenwick Shoal, offshore  southern-most Delaware, and Weaver Shoal and Shoals B and D offshore  Maryland. ITEM 2. Coordination with the Maryland and Delaware Geological  Surveys (MDGS, DGS) (Task 2): Prior to initiation of any field work, the  Contractor will discuss prior field work conducted by the MDGS and DGS within  the potential borrow/study areas and obtain any data or information that  might be used during the conduct of this project. The Contractor will also  search the available literature base for additional relevant field data or  information. This information will be used to the maximum extent possible to  address the study elements outlined under Item 1. ITEM 3. Preparation of the  Draft and Final Technical Manuscript (Task 3): After all field observations  are complete and all data and samples have been analyzed, the Contractor  shall prepare a report.

<CONTACT>Mr. Lano Balulescu, Contract Specialist, (781) 377-9011, Ms. Christine Baron, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-9304
<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis. This is not a solicitation, but market research to determine potential offerors. The Global Air Traffic Operations, Mobility Command and Control (GATO MC2) Program Office, Navigation & Landing Systems Division (ESC/GAL), wishes to identify potential Prime Contractors for the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Local Area Differential Global Positioning System (LDGPS) Component Advanced Development (CAD) phase of the JPALS program. The potential Prime contractor will be required to continue with the development of the JPALS LDGPS technical architecture and the reduction of key military LDGPS technical risks.  The specific objectives of the CAD phase of the JPALS program are: (1) Using the functional allocation produced during the Concept Exploration (CE) phase of JPALS as a starting point,further define the functions, interfaces, and allocations needed to satisfy the performance requirements identified in the JPALS System Requirements Document (SRD). (2) Using the physical architecture produced during the CE phase of JPALS as a starting point, develop a JPALS Tactical physical architecture to include analyzing and modeling of differential correction and navigation processing algorithms, integrity and protection level algorithm development, inertial aiding architecture analysis, analyze and quantify the effects of anti-jam technologies on JPALS guidance quality performance, and conduct an integrated architecture analysis that examines the relationship between system architecture variations, operational environments and system performance.  (3) Provide characterization data of evolving GPS receivers and anti-jam technologies to support a Government study or provide GPS receivers or anti-jam technologies for Government testing.  4) Provide detailed documentation of the modeling and simulation (M&S) tools used to generate architecture recommendations and support Government validation of the tools and support the Government in development of an independent M&S capability.  (5) Identify and evaluate ground multipath mitigation techniques that could be used by the JPALS ground station and potentially demonstrate these techniques.  (6) Perform or support the testing of contractor or Government equipment or software, to include test planning, integration, operation, data collection and analysis, and reporting of results.  (7) Design, build, and test a prototype Tactical Performance Type (PT) 1 ground station that meets the JPALS requirements.  The intent of this sources sought is to identify potential prime contractors. Sources interested in being a prime contractor shall submit a qualification package that shall not exceed ten (10) one-sided pages. The qualification package should include the following information regarding the offerors' capabilities: (1) experience with navigation, and landing systems development and testing (including tactical ground systems, avionics receivers, antenna electronics, avionics integration, antennas, etc.); (2) experience with GPS ground and airborne equipment development and testing (including GPS modeling and simulation and use of the Precise Positioning Service (PPS)); (3) experience with the GRAM standard and GPS Modernization (including Navigation Warfare (Navwar) and Anti-Jam (A-J) technologies); (4) experience with the civil SCAT I or LAAS ground and avionics equipment; (5) experience with data link design and encryption techniques; (6) availability of modeling, simulation, and test facilities; Interested offerors should submit two (2) copies of their qualification packages to ESC/GAK, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2103, Attn: Ms. Christine Baron, Contracting Officer or via electronic transmission to: Christine.Baron@hanscom.af.mil or Mr. Lano Balulescu, Contract Specialist, Lano.Balulescu@hanscom.af.mil.  Responses must be received No Later Than January 31, 2002 and should not exceed ten (10) pages on 8 ½ X 11 inch paper with type no smaller than 10 pitch. The Government will assess prospective offerors' potential to be the JPALS prime contractor based on the information provided in the qualification packages. Firms considered by the Government to be highly competitive to plan and execute the JPALS program as a prime contractor will be contacted by the PCO and a list of such firms will be made available on the Hanscom Electronic Requirements Bulletin Board (HERBB) at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/, under "Biz Opportunities", and Joint Precision Approach and Landing System. Firms who submit qualification packages in response to this notice are requested to identify any existing contract vehicles (by contract number and issuing office) that they have for the same or similar items/efforts and a Government point of contact (preferably the Contracting Officer).  Should it be in the best interests of the Government and be within scope of an existing contract, the Government reserves the right to satisfy its requirements under that contract. Firms considered by the Government not to be highly competitive to plan and execute the JPALS program as a prime contractor will be afforded an opportunity to receive the Government's rationale and provide additional information. If the Government decides to proceed with a solicitation request, the Government will post portions of the draft RFP on the HERBB and will invite all interested offerors to provide feedback on the draft RFP documentation. These documents will include, but are not limited to, the Statement of Objectives, System Requirements Document, evaluation criteria for award, and Instructions for Proposal Preparation. Proposed subcontractors may participate with their proposed prime contractor in providing feedback to draft RFP documentation. Please note that HERBB will be the primary source of information for the JPALS acquisition. Interested parties should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service for JPALS. Interested firms are encouraged to identify potential commercial or non-developmental item solutions for meeting the JPALS requirements. Firms should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, or women-owned small business, or whether they qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether or they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from interested firms during this phase of the acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government official. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of responses, source selection, or formulation of acquisition strategy. The Electronic Systems Center's Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff,(781) 377-5106. The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have been brought previously to the attention of the program manager and/or contracting officer and could not be resolved satisfactorily at that level. Any interested firm initially judged to be not highly competitive would be provided a copy of the solicitation upon request. Any offer submitted by such a firm will be evaluated without prejudice. The Government is planning to conduct a Presolicitation Conference. The exact date and other pertinent information will be posted on the HERBB at least three weeks prior to the conference. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Please direct any questions on this Sources Sought Synopsis to Ms. Christine Baron, Contracting Officer, 781-377-9304, or Mr. Lano Balulescu, Contracts Specialist, 781-377-9011.  See Note 26.
