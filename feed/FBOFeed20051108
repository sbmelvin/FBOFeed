Subject:  	Pre-solicitation Notice to the Water Sector Institutional Capacity 
Building Program (WIC) RFP


Dear prospective bidders:

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in West Bank and Gaza intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), to implement the program described below. The new Water Sector Institutional Capacity Building Program (WIC) is designed to provide a mechanism that responds to critical needs in the Palestinian water sector to improve the capacity of water sector institutions to operate and maintain water systems in the West Bank and to build broad-based public support for reducing unaccounted for water losses, adopting water conservation practices, and achieving cost recovery.  The WIC program will provide training and critically needed commodities to the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), the West Bank Water Department (WBWD), Joint Services Councils (JSC), and local governments in the West Bank.

The goals and purpose of the WIC program will be achieved through four activities: 

(1) Provide hands-on training to the PWA, the WBWD, JSCs, and local governments in order to repair, maintain, and expand water and wastewater infrastructure (wells, pumps, distribution and collection networks, water treatment and wastewater treatment plants); 

(2) Achieve cost recovery through better management of revenue streams; 

(3) Improve water productivity through reducing leakage, other sources of unaccounted-for water losses, and promoting water conservation best practices and technologies; and, 

(4) Develop strategic plans for eventual regional integration of water and wastewater services.  In addition to technical assistance, this RFP requires procurement of substantial amounts of commodities in the form of replacement pipes, meters, pumps, vehicles, and other equipment needed for urgent repairs to aging and damaged water systems throughout the West Bank.  Due to the critical lack of financial resources in the water sector, West Bank water service providers will be unable to implement repairs to their systems unless these commodities are provided in conjunction with necessary hands-on training.  



U.S. Agency for International Development
American Embassy
71, Hayarkon St.	
Tel Aviv 63903

This RFP pertains specifically to all four activities of the WIC program listed above. One direct cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded for implementation of all these four activities. There will be Grants under Contracts (GUCS) component under the program and Information technology equipment may be procured as part of this project. Prospective offerors are encouraged to include qualified Palestinian sub-contractors.     Implementation under the contract will occur over three years. The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under the Water Resources and Infrastructure Office.     

The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov). In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. 

Questions must be directed to Ms. Hourig DelDelian, Sr. Contract Specialist, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: hdeldelian@usaid.gov , fax no. (972-3-511-4893). USAID/West Bank and Gaza anticipates issuing the RFP o/a October 20, 2005. 

A pre-proposal conference will be held shortly thereafter, with specifics to be addressed in the RFP.                                   

In an effort to be as transparent as possible the following information is provided.  USAID originally attempted to procure these services through an RFP under the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts (MOBIS).  The MOBIS RFP statement of work (attached) is essentially the same as the statement of work we will be using for this RFP to be issued o/a October 20, 2005.  The MOBIS RFP was issued on July 15, 2005 to eight firms and cancelled on August 11, 2005 after a determination was made that the statement of work was inappropriate for procuring under the MOBIS contracts. 
 
In order to facilitate teaming arrangements, firms are requested to notify Ms. DelDelian of the firm name, address, point of contact person and email address, which will be included in a list of interested firms as an attachment to the RFP. 


							Sincerely,
                                                        /S/

2.	Organization of the Study Solicitations

As part of a grant provided to the Government of Senegal (GoS) under the authority of Section 609(g) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003, the MCC intends to procure services for the preparation of feasibility studies, environmental impact assessment and related studies and plans for a new industrial and residential site at Diamniadio, about 30km from the capital city of Dakar. In addition to this A-E contract, concurrent consultancies are planned to address basic institutional and land management issues, as well as to assess demand for industrial space, and this information will be integrated into the feasibility and related studies. 


3. 	Project Information

3.1	MCC Project

The proposed MCC-financed project will involve the following three components:

(1)	Establish the essential infrastructure for a fully serviced new industrial and residential site, referred to as the Millennium Platform. Essential infrastructure is defined to include:

i.	Exterior Platform Infrastructure necessary to ensure the Platform is fully serviced and addresses direct and indirect environmental concerns; and

ii.	Interior Platform Infrastructure, which includes the primary “backbone” networks within the platform, including drainage, potable and industrial water supply, solid waste collection, residential wastewater and pre-treated industrial wastewater collection system, final drainage systems (including pipelines, culverts, detention ponds, etc.), a ring road, arterial roads and other essential connector roads, and a railroad dry dock.  

(2)	Create a financing facility to provide term financing to small- and medium-sized enterprises wishing to locate in Diamniadio, or wishing to relocate from Dakar to Diamniadio.

(3)	Provide institutional assistance, capacity building and administrative support, related to governance and management of municipal services. 

This announcement concerns A-E services related to the first component, which will be carried out in two phases:

Phase 1 – This Phase will include a pre-feasibility study, an initial environmental examination, and initial design.  The pre-feasibility analysis will establish the overall project and its phasing.  It will produce pre-feasibility level designs of essential infrastructure; initial social and environmental examinations; preliminary cost estimates and financial and economic analyses.

Phase 2 – This phase will commence following a full review of the Phase 1 Report and involve: (a) the full feasibility study and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); and (b) (optionally) detailed design of the “early action” infrastructure program. This phase will also include preparation of terms of reference (TORs) for the ongoing design and construction supervision Contractors and/or a design-build Contractor.

The services are expected to be completed within 15 months of commencement.

3.2	Studies to Date and Background Reports

The Government has prepared an Urban Development Plan (Plan Urban d’Aménagement – PUD) for the Diamniadio Platform area, which consists of a general urban layout for the 2,620 Ha site, including the location of land use zones (80% industrial; 20% residential), major roads and natural areas.  In addition, baseline studies have been carried out and technical reports and draft bidding documents have been prepared on a portion of the area based on a previous conceptual plan.  These studies and reports provide some relevant information which will assist in the development of further baseline and technical studies during the feasibility process.

3.3	Initial Cost Estimates of Platform Infrastructure

The proposed A-E services will address all of the technical and environmental issues associated with the required infrastructure serving the proposed Platform. The following table summarizes the preliminary cost estimates developed for the essential infrastructure exterior and interior to the 2,620 Ha Platform site.

Potential Essential Infrastructure	Initial Cost Estimates
(Million USD)
Exterior Platform Infrastructure	30
Interior Platform Infrastructure	205

<DESC>The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health,  is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AID epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The Division of AIDS intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke’s Medical Center under Contract No. N01-A1-85354, scheduled to expire on September 20, 2005. This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  The primary focus of this solicitation is to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DIAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies. The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, and assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.   Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the Contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base Contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the Contract, and such an increase in the Contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the Contract years.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Most, but not all, Sites are currently linked through an electronic network which is used to transmit virology data from the Sites to a remote Central Database.  Sites are also using a customized laboratory data management system (LDMS) that tracks specimens, provides assay templates, calculates derived quantities, produces reports, and generates data files for export from the Site.  The successful offeror will be required to provide some VQA-related information through the DAIDS-ES.  While some of this may be accomplished through a link from DAIDS-ES to the VQA web site, some data may need to be shared by the VQA, with DAIDS ES, in which case data sharing agreements, standards, etc. will be required.  Specifically the contractor shall be required to perform the following: 1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; 2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; 3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; 4) disseminate VQA technical and scientific data; 5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; 6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options; and 7) implement a transition plan at the end of the contract.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about August 15, 2005 to August 14, 2012. This RFP will be available electronically on/about October 29, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to award or a contract.  See Numbered Note 26.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON A SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT SOLUTION
 
The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) is seeking information regarding best in class Enterprise IT Systems Management solutions.  We are specifically looking for architectures, methods, configurations and processes that lead to a strategic and comprehensive array of services and capabilities for efficiently and effectively managing IT infrastructure components and resources found within the Department.  The results of this RFI may result in the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide a specific solution to support DOT enterprise IT systems and lifecycle management along with integration planning for the existing Service Management platform Remedy ARS 6.0. 

The procurement will entail all aspects of systems management including (but not limited to) the following areas:
•	Local system snapshot and rollback 
•	Real-time diagnosis and remediation 
•	Comprehensive hardware and software inventory 
•	OS imaging, deployment, and configuration 
•	Policy-based mobile software delivery 
•	System vulnerability assessment and patch management 
•	Application self-healing and repair 
•	Conflict analysis and desired state 
•	Application usage and denial of service 
•	Remote control and file system sync 
•	PC personality and OS migration 
•	Web-based remote control 
•	Software packaging and delivery
Input from this solicitation will focus on an implemented Federal Government Common Operating Environment (COE) and should help us understand best practices, tools, methods, designs and integrated product offerings for provisioning full lifecycle management and monitoring of IT resources.  Sources are asked to provide independent assessments and technical capabilities of products, processes, architectures, services and methodologies that would enable the full management of IT infrastructure, management systems and the business application hosting environment found within the DOT. 

Sources responding to this RFI should possess a comprehensive understanding of IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) processes, practices, procedures in order to suggest methods and practices aiming at a seamless integration into the existing DOT IT management system supporting the COE (e.g.,  Remedy ARS 6.0).  Sources must be credible and must demonstrate successful experience designing and implementing a solution capable of providing all aspects outlined in the systems management aspects identified above.  Ideally, design and implementation recommendations will minimize the number of disparate hardware or software components and could be provisioned by a single contractor.  

Any recommendations or solutions should also demonstrate IPv6 compliance and be able to integrate with other IPv6 compliant hardware/software that may not be part of the proposed solution.  If the proposed solution is not immediately IPv6 compliant, a roadmap of activities will be required to show how compliance will be achieved in the next 2-3 years.  

Sources must have proven expertise in Service Management and systems deployment. This should be documented through presented white papers and documented, successful, deployments of their solutions in large, multi-platform environments. The successful deployments need to ideally demonstrate a single vendor solution with direct partnership(s) with software vendor(s) that would be used to provide the system solution. 

Upon review, further requests may be made to supported solution recommendations.  Sources would then provide a more detailed synopsis of the solutions and costs. DOT may also request that one or more Sources complete a proof of concept that would  demonstrate all aspects of the service management solution recommendation, including the seamless integration to the DOT IT Service Management system, Remedy ARS. 

Upon successful completion of a proof of concept an award or BPA may be made to provide systems management supporting the DOT Common Operating Environment. 
 
This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It is not a notice of a solicitation, and does not constitute a Government agreement to contract.  Interested sources must submit the firm’s name, address, phone number, contact name, business entity, and a brief description, not to exceed 10 pages, explaining in detail your recommendations, designs, methodologies and other solution aspects.  Responses are required by 3:00 pm on Tuesday December 5, 2005 and should be submitted via electronic mail to rhonda.robinson@dot.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), is soliciting proposals for individual instructors for specialized law enforcement courses.  Course participants cover a broad range of students, including inspectors, technical specialists, special agents and management personnel.  The law enforcement subject areas for which instructors are required are Arson; Explosives; Firearms Identification and Investigation; Use of Force; Special Operations and Advanced Investigations; Leadership; Industry Operations and Basic Training. 

ATF intends to award several Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) covering a five-year period that will be available for placing calls/orders for services at U. S. and worldwide locations.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF will periodically solicit additional offers to add new instructors to the pool.  Therefore, ATF will have recurring open submission periods to receive and evaluate proposals for additional contract instructors. The following schedule depicts the current and anticipated solicitation, submissions and evaluation timeframes:
Proposal Submission Times:
BPA Year 1	Current solicitation period:  November 8, 2005 – December 9, 2005	July 1, 2006 – July 15, 2006
BPA Year 2	January 1, 2007 – January 15, 2007	July 1, 2007 – July 15, 2007
BPA Year 3	January 1, 2008 – January 15, 2008	July 1, 2008 – July 15, 2008
BPA Year 4	January 1, 2009 – January 15, 2009	July 1, 2009 – July 15, 2009
BPA Year 5	January 1, 2010 – January 15, 2010	July 1, 2010 – July 15, 2010
The overall BPA performance period is expected to continue through January 2011.  For consideration for the first series of awards, interested offerors should submit a response by December 9, 2005, 3:00 PM local time. Proposals will be evaluated and awards will be made to eligible, qualified and highly rated individuals.  ATF seeks to establish cadres of instructors that can provide timely high-quality training.

Please note that a BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and services and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements.  There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor/instructor in order to be retained on the ATF BPA calling list.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force and effect: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan. 05); 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items (Sep. 05), and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial (Sep. 05).

<DESC>On December 17, 1999, the President signed legislation (P.L. 106-170) establishing the Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program.  Under the Program, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement to contract with vendors to become employment networks (ENs), with responsibility for the coordination and delivery of services necessary to prepare and place beneficiaries in employment.  The purpose of the Ticket Program is to provide disability beneficiaries more choices for receiving employment services and increase provider incentives to serve these individuals.  Under the program, SSA will provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain employment services, Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services or other support services from an EN of their choice.  The Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program has been phased-in nationally (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) over a three-year period.  Implementation of the Ticket Program has been accomplished in phases.  Phase 1 began in 2001 and Tickets were distributed beginning in February 2002 in 13 States:  Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  Phase 2 began in 2002 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2002 in 20 States (and the District of Columbia):  Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,  Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  Phase 3 began in 2003 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2003 in 17 States (and U.S. territories and possessions):  Alabama, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  As SSA continues to release Tickets based on new accretions to the disability roles, this solicitation will remain open continuously until further notice.  Contractors serving as ENs will be responsible for an array of duties including, but not limited to: (1) providing appropriate employment services, VR services or other support services consistent with the successful attainment of a clients employment goal(s), either directly or by entering into contracts or agreements with other providers of such services; (2) providing the client with a comprehensive explanation of the service offered, as well as the ENs responsibilities to its clients; (3) developing jointly with the client an Individual Work Plan (IWP) that defines the clients employment goals(s) and outlines the services and supports necessary to achieve and maintain that goal; and (4) reporting data to SSA on specific client outcomes achieved through the provision of services, a statement of finances, and other management information data.  Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the Statement of Work, accompanying Response Pages, and required documentation.  It is anticipated that each contract will be for a 5-year term, with one 5-year option period.  The Request for Proposal (RFP), SSA-RFP-06-0010E, will be available for downloading on November 8, 2005 from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES WILL NOT BE MAILED.  IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS REQUIRED, PLEASE CONTACT THE EMPLOYMENT NETWORKS CONTRACTS TEAM TOLL-FREE AT 1-866-584-5180; FOR THE HEARING-SPEECH IMPAIRED CALL TOLL-FREE AT 1-866-584-5181 (operational beginning Dec. 1, 2005).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

With regard to planning, the EASE Program Office (PO) seeks comments on the attached draft Screening Information Request (SIR) and Statement of Work.  The draft SIR is without Sections L and M.  Those sections are currently being drafted.  The PO is open for written comment(s) only from the date of this announcement until October 31, 2005.  The PO does not intend to engage in written or verbal discussion with the author of the comment. Comments will merely be considered for use in enhancing the quality of the SIR.  In any event, the PO is not obligated to directly or indirectly respond either in writing or verbally to the author's comment.  Telephone comments or discussions are unacceptable and will not be entertained.  In view of the above discussion, please direct all comments to the following e-mail address:	glenn.a.Wilson@faa.gov 2. Market Survey:	In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS, this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: Capability Statement - In view of the scope of the attached draft EASE SOW, this document should describe capability and identify past performance references concerning operation and maintenance of a computing facility of similar size and scope for five years within the past seven years, with an availability rate of 99% percent or better.  (Limited to 5 pages) Resumes - These resumes should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in conjunction with the Key Personnel paragraph in the SIR. Expected approach to provide the computing facility, hardware and software components to augment FAA-provided equipment, disaster facilities, and staffing as stated in the SOW. Expected approach to migrate work to the new facility with not more than 72 hours service disruption. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  The FAA Acquisition Management System clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations On Subcontracting will apply. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Attached is the present draft of the statement of work.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this effort is 54153 (Size Standard is $21 Million). This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition. However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition. With regard to this survey, interested respondents must submit information requested by the date and to the point of contact identified in paragraph one above.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine potential sources technically capable and qualified to furnish non?personal services that include personnel, supervision, management, transportation materials (except where such materials are furnished by the Government) necessary to manage and operate an Internet-based Contractor Operated Parts Store (ICOPARS).  The contractor shall be required to furnish automotive and related vehicle parts, automotive chemicals, corrosion control materials, upholstery material and accessories for approximately 3,500 vehicles/equipment located in Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and any other country that is part of the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility.  The specific performance requirements are listed in the attached draft statement of work (SOW), which will be finalized after responses to this sources sought synopsis are received from interested parties.  The information and capabilities submitted by interested vendors will be used to prepare a prospective offeror’s list and design an acquisition strategy to include socioeconomic program support.  Include any suggestions on what your firm would consider standard commercial practices that may improve upon the performance requirements listed in the draft SOW.

<DESC>Request For Information
FA8104-06-R-0026
Small Business Participation


1.  Description: Provide Contractor Field Team (CFT) services to support the United States Air Force and other DoD and Government agencies.  Contract Field Teams are a mobile work force used to supplement organic and contractor fixed facilities.  These teams accomplish modification/maintenance/repair on weapons systems and support equipment at operational government installations both within the Continental United States and overseas.  The work is accomplished on various DoD and Government weapons systems and support equipment.  The solicitation contemplates the award of between three and five contracts with time and materials contract line items and potentially firm-fixed price contract line items as well.  Any contracts resulting from this solicitation shall be evaluated using source selection procedures set forth is AFFARs 5315.3.  The anticipated date for release of the draft RFP is 26 Jan 2006, followed by an Industry day on approximately 13 Feb 2006, followed by issuance of the formal RFP on approximately 20 Mar 2006.  These dates are tentative only.  The estimated date of contract award is 22 Dec 2006.  The contract will be an IDIQ, with a minimum of one task order and with no maximum.  Length of contract is anticipated to be ten years total, with a two-year basic and 4 two-year options.  The estimated dollar value of the contract will be between $10-15 Billion.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered.  Any synopses, RFPs, amendments, etc. will be provided through the GPE at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Potential contractors must be prepared to comply with a vast variety of requirements not ordinarily experienced, including security, hazardous duty areas, immediate responsiveness to unusual needs, and adhere to demanding schedules.  For more information regarding Contract Field Teams, reference Air Force Material Command Instruction 21-141, 05 Aug 2005.

2.  A partial small business set-aside is being contemplated.  However, market research must be performed in order to determine if small businesses have the capabilities necessary to perform CFT work.  This RFI does not in any way ensure this requirement will be partially set-aside, and the government retains its right to either set-aside all, a portion, or none of the requirement at the discretion of the contracting officer(s).
  
3.  Background:  The current contracts contain both Time and Materials and Firm-Fixed CLINs; however, virtually all of the CFT work falls under the Time and Materials CLINs.  When a requirement generates, task orders will be competed in accordance with AFMCI 21-141.

4.  Due to the complexity of the CFT effort, if a partial small business set aside became a part of the CFT concept, some limitations would more than likely become a part of the set-aside methodology.  For example, requirements set aside for small business might be limited to a certain dollar value, to CONUS work only, to a certain type of maintenance (vehicle maintenance for example), to certain geographic locations, a combination of these or another discriminator entirely.  One purpose of this request for information is to determine the capabilities of small businesses in relation to CFT, and what limitations, if any, would be appropriate.

5.  Some considerations small businesses should contemplate before considering proposing against the upcoming CFT solicitation:

	a.  CFT teams currently range anywhere from 5-1000 person teams.  
	b.  CFT teams often go TDY to both CONUS and OCONUS locations at short 
notice.  (approximately a 24-48 hour turn-time.)
	c.  Historically, CFT contractors have experienced a time delay of up to 2 weeks 
between invoicing and payment.  This delay has caused CFT contractors to carry 
thousands of dollars of debt while awaiting payment.
d.  Some CFT teams are located at overseas locations, including some haz

<DESC>The sources sought synopsis for FA8104-06-R-0026 is hereby updated to reflect current state of events and to rectify omissions in the original:

The original synopsis indicated that a small business set-aside was not contemplated at this time.  To clarify, the source selection team is currently in the process of conducting market research to determine if a partial small business set-aside is feasible.

Due to administrative error, the original synopsis neglected to mention that an IDIQ contract is contemplated, with a minimum of one task order and no maximum.

Estimated timelines have changed as follows:

Industry Day (focus on Small Business): 21 Nov 05
Draft RFP issuance: 26 Jan 06
Industry Day (focus on Solicitation Feedback):13 Feb 06
Formal RFP issuance: 20 Mar 06
Estimated Award Date: 22 Dec 06

All dates are tentative with the exception of the Industry Day (focus on Small Business) scheduled for 21 Nov 05.
ardous 
areas such as Iraq, Southwest Asia, etc.
e.  Once a delivery order is placed for a CFT team, a contractor may have as little 
as 24-48 hours to have a team in place. 
f.  Currently, the CFT contract uses the following 10 skills recognized by the 
Department of Labor: Inspector, Mechanic, Maintenance Electronics Technician 
III, Painter, Worker, Servicer, Helper, Stock Clerk, Supply Technician, and 
Production Control Clerk.  CFT contractors are required to form teams of various 
sizes with these skill sets as well as additional specialty skills as necessary for a wide variety of maintenance activities. 
g.  CFT contractors are often required to purchase Contractor Acquired Property (CAP) and/or Contractor Acquired Services (CAS) in performance of the contract.
h.  Due to the complexity of CFT work, CFT contractors should have an accounting system capable of adequately tracking timekeeping, invoices, costs accrued, etc. down to the CLIN level on each order at numerous sites.

6.  An industry day for the purpose of performing market research is planned for 21 Nov 2005 at the Reed Center 5800 Will Rogers Parkway (I-40 & Sooner Exit), Midwest City, OK.  A map is attached.  The conference will begin at 8:00 a.m. and will end by approximately 1:00 p.m.  Please e-mail Brandi Priddy or Jeff Frederick using the information below with your company name and number of attendees no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on 18 Nov 2005 if you plan to attend.  Please note that this is separate from the industry day tentatively planned for 13 Feb 2006 for the purpose of solicitation feedback.  Submit any questions regarding participation for the CFT effort in writing only no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time 15 Nov 2005 to:
	
	Brandi Priddy/Jeff Frederick
	448 CSW/PKM
	3001 Staff Drive Ste 2AG1 109H
	Tinker AFB, 73145-3045
	Brandi.Priddy@tinker.af.mil
	Jeff.Frederick@tinker.af.mil

All questions submitted in writing to the above addresses via U.S. mail or e-mail by the time stated will be addressed at the conference.  

7.  After the conference, any small businesses wishing to propose on the upcoming CFT solicitation are requested to submit their answers to the questions below, and if desired, a description of the small business’s capabilities in relation to the CFT contract(s) to the address listed above (either by e-mail or U.S. mail) no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, 30 Nov 2005.  The description of capabilities, if submitted, shall be limited to no more than 15 pages in length, with a font size no smaller than 10 point.  Your answers to the questions below shall be limited to no more than 3 pages in length, with a font size no smaller than 10 point.  The answers to these questions and the descriptions will help aid the contracting officer(s) in the determination of what portion of CFT, if any, to partially set aside for small business.  However, this RFI does not in any way ensure this requirement will be partially set-aside, and the government retains its right to either set-aside all, a portion, or none of the requirement at the discretion of the contracting officer(s).

8.  QUESTIONS:

1.  What terms, conditions, and limitations would need to be included in a partial set-aside in order for your small business to participate in the CFT program?  

2.  Based on the work described in paragraph number one, what is the scope and type of work you think would be within your small business’s capabilities if it was set-aside for small businesses?

3.  Based on your answer to question number one, how would your small business obtain the financing you estimate will be needed to perform work potentially set-aside for small businesses?

4.  How would your small business address the hiring of experienced personnel needed to meet CFT manning needs?

5.  How would your small business meet the needs of moving teams overseas within 24-48 hour notice?

6.  Based on the work described in paragraph one, are there any areas of CFT you feel your small business could not address that should be excluded from any potential partial set-aside?
			
7.  The government is anticipating a 10-year IDIQ contract: a 2-year basic with four 2-year options.  As CFT work has historically been virtually entirely Time and Materials, contractors must be able to project the burdens and profit contained in their billing rates for the next ten years.  Can your small business accurately project these costs for the next ten years?  What are your concerns regarding this period of performance?   

8.  How would your small business plan to perform in an OCONUS environment, including but not limited to: international law, treaties, agreements, security requirements, and potentially hazardous duty areas?

Clarification:  The RFP has been posted at PIXS with a status of  "pre-solicitation" and a "draft" watermark on the documents.  The  "pre-solicitation" status is an attempt to fix a communication problem  between PIXS and FBO, and the documents are marked as drafts only because  legal review has not been completed.

Once the review process is complete, we will  convert the status of the posting to "released RFP" and remove the "draft"  watermark from the postings.  However, we went ahead and posted the RFP in  draft status to give offerors as much time as possible before the 15 Nov  05 response date to prepare their proposals.

<DESC>The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health,  is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AID epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The Division of AIDS intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke’s Medical Center under Contract No. N01-A1-85354, scheduled to expire on September 20, 2005. This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  The primary focus of this solicitation is to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DIAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies. The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, and assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.   Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the Contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base Contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the Contract, and such an increase in the Contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the Contract years.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Most, but not all, Sites are currently linked through an electronic network which is used to transmit virology data from the Sites to a remote Central Database.  Sites are also using a customized laboratory data management system (LDMS) that tracks specimens, provides assay templates, calculates derived quantities, produces reports, and generates data files for export from the Site.  The successful offeror will be required to provide some VQA-related information through the DAIDS-ES.  While some of this may be accomplished through a link from DAIDS-ES to the VQA web site, some data may need to be shared by the VQA, with DAIDS ES, in which case data sharing agreements, standards, etc. will be required.  Specifically the contractor shall be required to perform the following: 1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; 2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; 3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; 4) disseminate VQA technical and scientific data; 5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; 6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options; and 7) implement a transition plan at the end of the contract.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about August 15, 2005 to August 14, 2012. This RFP will be available electronically on/about October 29, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to award or a contract.  See Numbered Note 26.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

BEAKED WHALE TAGGING AND DIVE STUDIES IN HAWAII
STATEMENT OF WORK

I.  BACKGROUND
	Under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is required to periodically assess the status of marine mammal populations in waters under U.S. jurisdiction.  Population size and trends in population size are some of the most valuable data used for this purpose.  Large-scale ship surveys were conducted in 2002 around the Hawaiian Islands; however, there is no data on beaked whale diving in this area on which to base abundance correction factors.  
	In addition to general population assessment, NMFS has a mandate to monitor and mitigate human-caused impacts on marine mammal population.  Recently, the strandings of beaked whales has been associated with loud anthropogenic sounds, such as military sonars.  NMFS is working with the U.S. Navy to determine what factors are involved in causing these strandings.  Lack of knowledge about the normal diving behavior of beaked whales is an impediment to understanding the cause of strandings.
	The intent of this contract is to improve information beaked whale diving behavior, near-shore distribution, and population structure around the Hawaiian Islands.  The contract is organized into an initial one-year project and one optional year of additional work.

II. TASKS
	The contractor will conduct studies of the diving behavior of beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris and/or Mesoplodon sp.) in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands between 1 Jan 2006 and 1 Nov 2006.  This will include collecting information on the distribution of dive times, dive depths, and surface times collected using recording tags attached to the animals.  Work is expected to be done from small boats (to be provided by the contractor).   Analyses should include cumulative distributions plots of time spent at each depth for each tagged individual.  In addition to studies of diving behavior of beaked whales, the contractor shall document all sightings of other marine mammals seen while conducting dive-behavior studies and shall obtain genetic samples (small tissue biopsies) from as many of these sightings as possible.  

	OPTION YEAR: Upon successful completion of the first year of field sampling, the Government may, at its discretion, choose to fund a second year of this work (between 1 Nov 2006 and 1 Nov 2007) to increase the sample size and collect additional data.  The contractor’s proposal should include a plan and budget for this option year.
	
III.  METHODOLOGIES
	The contractor will be allowed latitude to develop methods for radio/TDR tagging of beaked whales.  Biopsy samples will be taken by standard, accepted methods.  The contractor will be responsible for obtaining Marine Mammal Protection Act permits required for tagging activity as well as any permits that might be required by the State of Hawaii.

IV.  SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS
 
	The estimates of population parameters from this contract will be used in evaluating threats to the population and may be used as evidence for taking management actions.  For these reasons, it is necessary that the research be scientifically credible.  The quality of the final reports should be equivalent to that of published articles in scientific journals.  Genetic tissue samples shall be maintained in a fresh condition by chilling on ice onboard the boats used for this study and should be frozen as soon as they can be returned to land.

V.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
Field work                     1 Jan 2006 through 1 Oct 2006
Analysis, report writing:      1 Oct 2006 through 1 Nov 2006

OPTION YEAR
Field work:		   	1 Nov 2006 through 1 Oct 2007
Analysis, report writing:   	1 Oct 2007 through 1 Nov 2007


VII.  DELIVERABLES AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
	The contractor shall submit a final report presenting a summary of the methods and results.  Genetic tissue samples shall be transported in a frozen state to the SWFSC tissue archive in San Diego, CA.

End of RFI

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST),   proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Colorado at Denver to provide electromagnetic modeling of magnetic microcalorimeters.  This effort is the second year of support and is part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) project entitled “Multiplexed Arrays of Magnetic Calorimeters”.  This will include the following:  1) Using the COMSOL Multiphysics software package, perform inductance and response calculations for existing device geometries.  These geometries include, but are not limited to, the self-shielded meander and the balanced radiometer, with various field-coil geometries.  These calculations are to include the superconducting material properties of the magnetic pick-up coil and the magnetic material properties of the detector over layer as input parameters.  These calculations are to include the effective coupling constant and magnetic field plots as functions of temperature, electric current and or magnetic field, and position over appropriate ranges as outputs.  2) Repeat the above calculations for advanced, conceptual geometries (e.g., magnetometers and fractional-turn loops) presently in development by NIST staff.  3) Investigate ways to increase the coupling and or efficiency of thin film sensors, including but not limited to, reductions in scale.  4) Extend existing two-dimensional models to the three-dimensional models to improve model accuracy as necessary.  Reports will be submitted detailing progress and results.  Period of Performance shall be November 2005 through August 31, 2006 with effort continuing for an additional year through August 31, 2007 if funds are available.  Martin Huber of the University of Colorado at Denver is named as the co-investigator on this project, approved by NASA.  Martin Huber has demonstrated promising preliminary results in the first year of this effort and is uniquely qualified and is an established expert in design and modeling of SQUID magnetometers and related circuits.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Anticipated award date - November 28, 2005.

<DESC>The Continuity of Operations Program office (COOP) of the Federal Reserve System is seeking Request for Information (RFI) on Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Non-Developmental Items (NDI) for telecommunication systems, hardware, and installation services. All written and email correspondence shall be sent to the POC identified in message below. 

COOP program office participates in a wide array of interagency communication tests, communication exercises, and telecommunication working groups’ ensuring reliable and robust connectivity during disasters and emergencies. Therefore, our emergency preparedness branch coordinates closely with other national departments and agencies such as Federal Executive Branch, DHS, GSA, DoD, and others to identify potential gaps and recommend solutions for improvements.
 
RFI represents a call to industry for collection of available literature on contemporary technologies to design, furnish, and install communication systems in a fixed and/or mobile environment. Turn key projects under consideration include radio towers (guyed and freestanding), cell-on-wheels, cell-on-light-trucks, mobile command posts, and prefabricated ‘communication huts’ - with HVAC, generator backup power, etc. This information will in turn be shared within the community as needs may arise. 

This is not a request for proposal or quotations. No contract or award will be made as a result of this RFI and no future solicitations or RFI’s will be made. Information provided will be kept on file after an internal evaluation has been made. 

Scores and points will be attributed to companies with the widest selection of capabilities and history of past installation and performance. For example, completion of large scale turn-key projects such as tall towers, radios, and mobile communication shelters in the Middle-East will rank higher than a supplier of towers only in North America. In-house engineering capabilities to perform path profile analysis, wind load modeling, soil analysis for construction, personal communication devices, and heat load analysis for HVAC systems will also rank higher than just manufacturers and suppliers of those systems. Resumes of full time staff members with particular skills and abilities shall also be taken into consideration.

Written responses to this RFI are due NLT November 30, 2005 at 1700 EST and may be mailed or delivered via FEDEX, UPS, or DHL to: Eric M. Hainzer, Senior Emergency Management Specialist, Office of the Staff Director for Management, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 1709 New York Avenue, Mail Stop 705, Washington, D.C 20551. Phone: (202) 736-5679 and email at eric.hainzer@frb.gov. Email of this information is also acceptable.

<SUBJECT>73 -- Stainless Steel Flatware for Marine Corps Mess Halls

<RESPDATE>120805
<ARCHDATE>12232005
<CONTACT>John Martin, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-695-6225, Fax null, Email Martinjp@hqmc.usmc.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Marine Corps is conducting market research to determine whether there is any source of stainless steel flatware that is manufactured in the United States with stainless steel melted wholly in the United States or a “qualifying country” (that is, any country set forth in subsection 225.872-1 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)) who is interested in selling such flatware to the U.S. Marine Corps or its agents.  Currently, the Marine Corps operates 55 mess halls in the continental United States to feed Marine Corps personnel.  The stainless steel flatware used at these mess halls consists of stainless steel forks, knives, and spoons.  As a result of stainless steel flatware losses that occur each year, the Marine Corps annually must acquire replacement stainless steel flatware to maintain acceptable inventory levels at all of its mess halls.  Estimated annual replacement quantities are approximately 52,000 table forks; 28,000 table knives; 32,000 soup spoons; and 42,000 tea spoons.  Section 2533a of Title 10, United States Code, (as implemented by DFARS 225.7002-1(b)) prohibits the use of funds made available to the Department of Defense to purchase stainless steel flatware unless the flatware is produced in the United States with stainless steel melted wholly in the United States or a “qualifying country.”  For example, a U.S. company that silver-plates flatware manufactured by foreign sources does not qualify as a domestic producer of stainless steel flatware for the purpose of complying with these requirements.  If your company manufactures stainless steel flatware in the United States with stainless steel melted wholly in the United States or a qualifying country and is interested in selling such flatware to the U.S. Marine Corps, or its agents, please contact Mr. John Martin, at Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, at (703) 695-6225 ext 2529 or email Martinjp@hqmc.usmc.mil.  Our mailing address is: Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, Attn: Contracts Division (Code LB) John Martin, 2 Navy Annex, Room 2135, Washington, DC  20380-1775.  You may provide any literature that you have on the stainless steel flatware as well as your prices.  Information provided by companies shall be at no cost to the Government.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Closing date for responses is 8 December 2005.  There is no RFP or solicitation.

<DESC>The Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS), Picatinny, NJ, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources  capable of fulfilling a need for Suppy Chain Management services. The Program  Manager, Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) requires advisory support for the  development of a transformation plan that will enable PM CAS to evaluate the  benefits of a System Integration (SI) strategy versus a Horizontal Component  Integration (HCI) strategy for procurement of ammunition, fuzes and  propellant.  PM CAS is responsible for acquiring all artillery and mortar  ammunition, fuzes, and propellants for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.  Through  the use of a combined Government/Private Enterprise integrated process team  (IPT), PM CAS has completed a series of steps directed at identifying and  adopting the most appropriate methodology for procurement of the above listed  items.  PM CAS/IPT has completed acquisition management templates, a Business  Case Analysis (BCA), and separate analysis of the information from the  governmentâ€™s point of view.  PM CAS/IPT has also developed acquisition  management templates to aid in assessing cost vs. risk.  The IPT has identified  strategic system contracting nodes, or groups of systems and major sub-systems  to serve as the basis for an external System Integrator acquisition strategy.   This led PM CAS to reconsider the transformation of its internal system  integration capabilities.  The contractor shall assist PM CAS in developing a  transformation plan that enhances its organic system integration capabilities,  by addressing various process models, a dependency analysis, a change  management plan, and a risk assessment.  The next step is to fully understand  the transformation that needs to occur and to establish this understanding  through the design of a transformation plan.  The following step is to align  the PM CAS operating model with an external System Integrator acquisition  strategy and to quantify the expected benefit in terms of cost, delivery, and  technical performance/quality.  (1) The contractor must be fully able to assist  PM CAS in thoroughly understanding any dependencies of the proposed operating  models on human resources and/or technology, and to identify any opportunities  to enhance results through the use of technology solutions.  (2) The contractor  must be able to assist PM CAS in outlining a plan to transition from the  current mode to the selected mode by identifying critical success factors for  the transition, and create plans to enable them by developing a draft  Implementation Plan for the transition, including estimating transformational  and operational costs.  (3) The contractor must be able to assist PM CAS in  understanding and evaluating the risks associated with making the  transformation by conducting a risk assessment for the transformation  activities and for the projected end-state scenario.  (4) The successful  applicant must have knowledge of the DOD ammunition procurement system, current  inefficiencies with regards to acting as the SI for ammo from an internal  perspective and analytical comparative knowledge between an SI versus HCI  supply chain paradigm.  (5) Knowledge of PM CAS operating  procedures/procurement procedures and current issues regarding internal supply  chain management techniques is mandatory.  (6) All contractor personnel  assigned as principals to this contract must have empirical experience and  education that is consistent with the required task.  Interested parties are  encouraged to fully address their companyâ€™s qualifications in the six areas  identified in this notice.  The period of performance for this effort is  approximately nine (9) months from the date of contract award.  This is not a  solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All  responses must include company name, address, POC name, phone number, fax  number, and email address of POC, size of business, taxpayer identification  number, DUNS number, and CAGE code. All responses must be made no later than  COB on November 23, 2005. All contractors must be registered in the Central  Registration (CCR) at http://ccr.dlis.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html. Submittal of  information is requested via electronic mail only to pleasant@pica.army.mil.

<DESC>This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the Advanced Research Center (ARC) competition at the prime contractor level, and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those inte rested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level. The capability papers and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or team's ability to perform; that evaluatio n will be part of the formal source selection process. The Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command are seeking possible sources to perform High Performance Computing Research, Development and Acquisition and the operations and maintenance (O&M) support of the equipment and sy stems at the Advanced Research Center (ARC) located in Huntsville, Alabama. The anticipated competition will result in an indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a period of performance of two years with four one-year options and/or award te rms. It is anticipated that the requirements will be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements.  The effort consists of operating and maintaining computing platforms ranging from personal computers to high performance computers , auxiliary equipment such as storage media, high bandwidth communications equipment, multimedia communications equipment and all other equipment and facilities that form the ARC. Additionally, a contractor must be able to perform space and missile defense -related systems analyses and provide recommendations to the government on approaches to conduct experiments, exercises, modeling and simulations. The contractor must also be able to demonstrate the ability to assume all Research, Development, Test and Eva luation and Operation and Maintenance functions as they exist at the time of the contract start. This may include in-progress customer tests, experiments, exercises, wargames and other customer programs as well as upgrade and modernization tasks involving facility, hardware, and software efforts. The contractor must have the ability to implement changes in the support provided since existing systems may be removed from service and new systems introduced during the term of the contract. Some tests may requir e contractor personnel at remote sites. Due to uneven customer support requirements, the contractor should have the ability to provide qualified personnel to meet surge requirements. Firms that can meet requirements set forth above are requested to provide  a statement (not to exceed 10 pages) of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions. Information shall be provided to the Contract Specialist via e-mail to john.penley@sdmc.army.mil no later than 20 days from issuance of this Notice.  Firms responding should also state their company size and small business status, as well as their interest (i.e., as prime or subcontractor). NAICS Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees . This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the r esults of the evaluation. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and available at the SMDC Website (http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/ARC .html). It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation. The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC or MDA contracts.  To the greatest extent possible, while still pr otecting the Government's interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractor's actual technical analysis performance. The Contractor must be able to obtain and retain a Top Secret facility clearance. This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. A site visit of the ARC facility is anticipated and will be arranged at a later date. Original Point of Contact: John H. Penley, (256) 955-3000.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Technology Evaluation of Unmanned Maritime Vehicles for ship hull inspection.
<DESC>HULSFEST ANNOUNCEMENT This is to announce that the U.S. Navy EOD program office and the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division will be hosting an advanced technology evaluation of unmanned maritime vehicles for ship hull inspection missions as part of a market research effort.   Purpose: The purpose of this event will be to evaluate the technical feasibility of candidate technologies in conducting underwater ship hull object inspection and localization missions in support of the Navy EOD Ship Hull Object Localization System (HULS) acquisition program. This marine environment offers a tremendous challenge to mechanized solutions due to generally poor acoustic propagation, and the intensely demanding navigation and control requirements placed upon any vehicle attempting to conduct a thorough ship hull search.  The Navy is interested in exploring new technologies, both organic and mechanized, to increase search efficiency, while minimizing risk to personnel and high value platforms.  This event will examine potential hull inspection technologies and aid in developing a final system Performance Specification to support future procurement of a HULS system.  It will also allow early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  Participation in th!  is event will not ensure any contractual agreement with the government however; it will greatly aid the government in the development of a future EOD HULS.    Tentative Dates:     	20-24 Feb 2006 - Setup/Rehearsals 	     		27 Feb -03 Mar 2006 - Demonstrations  Location: SPAWAR Systems Center’s Bayside pier facilities, San Diego, CA Mission/Scenario/Key Performance Parameters:  The mission of the HULS system will be to relieve divers of the time-consuming search tasks and yield reliable maps with information on threat objects on areas of interest.  The system must also be capable of accurately returning to object locations for closer inspection/identification purposes, enabling operators to rule out objects of non-interest, and provide tactical information in terms of countering an ordnance threat.  It is desired that an unmanned maritime vehicle be able to autonomously maneuver near a ship’s hull and then conduct a complete scan of the vertical section of the hull down to the keel, and from bow to stern, to precisely map objects of interest.  While the vehicle conducts its mission, data will then be sent real-time or near real-time to a topside control unit.  Operators at the control unit will have the ability to view data to classify and identify any detected objects of interest.  Additionally, mission data should be recorded for later playback a!  nd analysis.  All mission data will be provided to the government to facilitate analysis. Key performance parameters of interest include:  ·	Detection and classification of targets (probability of detection/classification, and false alarms);  ·	Navigational accuracy (contact localization accuracy);  ·	Hull search rate;  ·	Reliability and ·	Vehicle portability (system must be easily and rapidly deployable from either a small boat or from a shore location near the ship).                   Ship Information: Demonstrations will be conducted on a 130 ft long, steel hull, twin screw Oceanographic research vessel moored next to concrete/wood/steel pier.  A flat bottom barge will also be available for workups and practice runs.  Notification of Interest: Request interested parties for this event provide Company/Organization Name, Personnel contact name(s), Address, Telephone Number, e-mail address, Technical brief of their candidate technology –no longer than 3 pages; no  later than 01 Dec 2005.  The technical brief shall describe the technology and must address the key performance parameters discussed above. Demonstration Process: It is the Government’s intent to allow all interested parties to conduct a demontration.  However, due to funding and time contraints, the Government reserves the right to limit the number of demonstrations.   The Government will schedule demonstrations based on the merits of the information provided in the technical briefs.   Planning Meeting: Approximately one to two months prior to the event, a coordination meeting will be held at Spawar System Center, San Diego to address questions, view demonstration facilities, and resolve any logistical issues.   Questions:  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to this event may be sent through the Technical POC’s.   Funding: The government does not intend to provide any funding to technology vendors to specifically support this event.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The contract will be awarded as a result of full and open competition.  A firm-fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  Award will be made to a single contractor for all analyses.  This procurement requires the contractor to provide all necessary personnel, facilities and equipment to determine nutrient concentrations in water samples of varying salinities beginning from date of award through December 20, 2006, with an option for 3 additional one year periods.  In the CLIN below, EA = Analyte.  CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN) 1.  7000 EA - See the Statement of Work for analytical requirements. The contractor shall provide analysis on approximately 1750 samples during the base period of date of award through December 20, 2006.   Samples will be shipped in batches 100 to 400 samples. Approximately 1500 of the samples will be from the water column (river, estuary, coastal ocean); the remaining 250 will be from interstitial water (IW) from within sediments.  All the water column samples will require results for 4 analytes (nitrate, ammonium, orthophosphate, and silicate).  Approximately half of the IW samples will require results for only 3 analytes (ammonium, orthophosphate, and silicate). Interstitial water samples will be delivered to the analytical laboratory particle fee and in the frozen state. The matrices of these water column and interstitial water samples could range from fresh water to ~32?.  The matrix attributes and analytes would be specified, by sample, in the  shipping information.  This combination of samples and analytes per sample yields approximately 7000 analytical results.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price on a per analyte basis for the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) above. Additional samples will be provided on an optional basis for the remaining periods.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price on a per analyte basis for the same services for CLIN 2 through 4 which is divided on a 12-month basis beginning 12/19/06 through 12/20/10.  The contractor shall provide results from each batch of samples within 3 weeks of EPA submission to contracting laboratory.  The shipping container and sample bottles (with unused sample) shall be returned to the shipping address using EPA-provided  and paid-for return shipping labels.  One photocopy of the plot of instrument response and standard concentrations used for each analyte quantified, including correlation coefficients.  This may be conveyed in electronic form (EXCEL or equivalent spreadsheet) if this information is available in this format.  The following results shall be conveyed to EPA in electronic format (EXCEL or equivalent spreadsheet, forwarded to the EPA via e-mail: -Results from replicate samples analyses and the analysis of spiked water expressed as the percent of expected. -Results for the specified analytes from the samples using the sample container sample number and the corresponding analytical result expressed in ?M.  The following FAR provisions apply to this  solicitation:  52.212-1, Evaluation-Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Item; 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Item.

Demonstration of Minimum Qualification Requirements:  (a) Lab management or personnel with at least 1 year experience analyzing seawater samples for the 4 nutrients at concentrations as low as the low end of the standardization range in the Statement of Work, Section 3.c.(1); (b) Ability to meet the 3-week minimum turn around requirement for the duration of the study (Statement of Work, Section 3.a.); (c) Ability to perform the 4 analyses with a minimum of 15 ml of sample; 2.) Demonstration of  evidence of participation in any state or federal laboratory certification programs, or a list of at least 2 publications in marine science journals that have used nutrient data provided by them; 3.) Submission of an electronic version of what the offeror would consider to qualify as a "Quality Assurance Manual" that is used to support the routine quality of its data; this document shall be in a Word or WordPerfect format; 4.) Offerors shall submit a response to the question, "How does your laboratory deal with samples of varying salinities (that are approximately known) when performing nutrient analyses?" and if 'matching the salinity matrix of samples' is necessary for your instrumentation, answer the question, "How close does the standard matrix need  to be to the sample matrix?"; 5.) Offerors shall submit a response to the question, "How does your laboratory deal with samples of widely varying concentrations (see Section 3.c.(1) of the Statement of Work for possible ranges) such as those that may be found in a batch of samples that contain IW samples (high ammonia) and fresh water (high silicate)?"  Would dilution and reanalysis following an initial determination be the strategy and would there be an additional charge for each sample requiring this treatment to obtain values within the instrument calibration? ; (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE - Submit a list of 3 "customers" who have submitted seawater samples for analysis within the past 2 years.  Include specific individuals to contact and their phone  numbers.  (Past performance will be evaluated as follows:  quality of product or service, timeliness of performance - ability to adhere to deadlines, and overall customer satisfaction); and (iii) PRICE.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1010487, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Thomas Billy of International Food Safety Consulting LLC under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to Food Safety Consulting LLC4802 Chevy Chase Blvd, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-5340.  There is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  Due to uncontrollable circumstances the contractor was not able to complete the work.  Continuing the services of Mr. Billy under this contract enables FDA to have ready access to an individual who is widely recognized as an expert in Food Safety and, more importantly methylmercury.   The potential health affects of methymercury in children and pregnant women is of great concern, and a high priority issue with members of Congress and the American people.  FDA needs the consistency of interaction between Mr. Billy and the stakeholders to ensure completion and any subsequent revision to reports.  Tom Billy is an internationally recognized leader in evaluating and managing food safety issues.  This expertise includes a detailed knowledge of seafood hazards and controls and the issue of methylmercury in particular; food safety risk assessment and analysis; and food safety risk management and communication strategies from both a national and international perspective.  His knowledge of, and experience in, these matters covers a broad spectrum that is important to this contract, in that he possesses a special understanding of all components of the food safety community both within and outside of the U.S. Federal government, including the international community, and has earned their respect.  Mr. Billy began his Federal career in fisheries research.  From 1974 to 1991 he served first as the Director of the Seafood Safety and Inspection Division of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce, then as that agency’s Director of Utilization Research and Inspection, and finally as the Deputy Director of the Office of Trade and Industry Services.   During this period he led efforts to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment on methylmercury in seafood and submit a petition to modify the FDA action level based upon this scientific analysis.  
In 1991 he was recruited to serve as the first director of FDA’s Office of Seafood.  A recognized seafood expert, he led efforts to develop an innovative HACCP program to improve seafood safety and served as the U.S. delegate to the Codex Alimentarius Committee on Fish and Fishery Products.   From 1994-1996, Mr. Billy served as Associate Administrator for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  He led the design and development of innovative program changes needed to improve the safety of meat and poultry products.  From 1996 to 2001, Mr. Billy served as Administrator for FSIS.  In this position he was leader of USDA’s food safety activities and managed an agency of 10,000 employees with an $800 million budget.  Mr. Billy’s efforts resulted in his receiving the 1997 Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Federal Executives.  He has also received two FDA Commissioner’s Special Citations.  Mr. Billy also was elected to serve two two-year terms as the Chairman of Codex Alimentarius.  As Chairman, Mr. Billy developed and gained support from the 168 members of the Codex Commission for strategies to strengthen the scientific basis for its work and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Codex, thus positioning it to address emerging food safety issues in the 21st century.  To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Billy is the only person qualified to lead the evaluations and develop the options called for in this contract in such a short time frame.   During his 39 year Federal career, Mr. Billy has gained leadership, policy, analytical, and communication skills that are needed to carry out this difficult task.  His particular knowledge of seafood safety and methylmercury in particular further strengthens his value in this effort.  His historical perspective on national and international issues related to this contract makes him uniquely qualified to accomplish the task required.  Also, Mr. Billy’s reputation and stature in the food safety community, both domestic and international, provide a degree of credibility and reassurance to stakeholders that would be difficult to duplicate and might not otherwise be readily obtainable for this project. These reasons, considered in their entirety, are why FDA anticipates a sole source award to Tom Billy of International Food Safety Consulting LLC, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 541710 –Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The following are objectives and tasks International Food Safety Consulting LLC will be requested to provide:  
Project Title:   Request Expert Services for Risk/Benefit Evaluation of Seafood Relating to Methylmercury in Commercial Fish.  Objective:  To perform risk/benefit evaluation(s) of commercial seafood that focus on the risk of methylmercury as weighed against nutritional and other health benefits, and provide options, including a preferred option where appropriate, for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration in light of the latest scientific, technical, and economic data and information.  These options will be made for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration about actions to be taken, if any, on the basis of this analysis and discussions and input from all stakeholders, giving due consideration to FDA’s broad responsibilities under the FD&C and PHS Acts.   Background:   Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that can have pronounced adverse effects in humans at very high doses.  These effects have been seen in extreme poisoning events as a result of industrial spills in Japan and Iraq.  In the United States, the primary exposure to methylmercury is generally regarded to be through the consumption of fish. Almost all fish have at least trace amounts of methylmercury.  Historically, the public health questions surrounding methylmercury have involved determining exposure through fish consumption over time that would be necessary to cause an adverse effect.  The degree of exposure is dependent on both the type and amount of fish consumed.  Public health actions, both in the United States and elsewhere, have focused on the development of “tolerable daily intake” levels for human exposure, regulatory limits, e.g., “action levels,” for the amount of methylmercury that would be allowed in fish, and consumer advisories recommending upper limits on fish consumption both in terms of amounts and types.  Fish have always been considered a good source of nutrition, but more recently, questions have been raised about potential health consequences of not consuming, or substantially limiting the consumption of, seafood.  Many of these questions derive from data about the beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish and other potentially positive nutritional characteristics of fish.  The recently revised consumer advisory on methylmercury emphasized the benefits of consuming fish but did not involve either a quantitative or qualitative assessment of the risks from mercury exposure versus the benefits of eating fish.  Scope of Work:  In cooperation with the Office of Seafood, and with the assistance of the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, the Chief Medical Officer, FDA staff, EPA, other federal agencies, and other stakeholders, as needed, the contractor shall:  1.  Conduct a new risk evaluation that takes into account all data and all previous assessments including the recent assessment by JECFA.  2.  Conduct a benefits evaluation of seafood in the diet that includes but is not necessarily limited to:  literature search, and analysis to the extent practicable of known and potential nutritional and other health benefits from seafood consumption and estimates of lost benefits and/or public health harm from dietary changes in seafood consumption, if any.    3.  Risk and benefit papers will be peer – reviewed under FDA auspices consistent with guidelines to meet FDA and OMB requirements.  4.  Coordinate contract work with the NAS/IOM Study on “Nutrient Relationships in Seafood: Selections to Balance Benefits and Risks” – participating in public meetings, make available the peer – reviewed Risk and Benefit papers and any modeling tools developed to the study.  5.  Provide options, including a preferred option where appropriate, to FDA for changes, if any, on the basis of the above evaluation(s).  Among other things, these options may relate to the consumer advisory, the action level, and consumer education.  6.  Conduct meetings with “stakeholders” in other Federal agencies, consumer advocacy organizations, industry, academia/scientific community, etc. on the purposes and scope of the work, the work itself, and gain their views and understanding.  7.  Conduct at least two public meetings, announced in the Federal Register, and conducted to share new data and information and to obtain oral and/or written input.  One or more of these public meetings may be held with NAS.  8.  Meet with agency, HHS, and other federal agency representatives on a regular basis to discuss the status of the project.  9.  Prepare briefing materials and provide support to the agency as needed.  10.  Provide advice associated with consumer studies by participation in the Technical Advisory Group. There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates. Support to be Provided by FDA:   adequate scientific technical support for research, risk and benefit assessment modeling, drafting, etc.; adequate office space, appropriately provisioned, e.g., desk, telephone, computer, in College Park for the duration of the contract.  Scientific technical support may be augmented by staff from EPA and other government agencies, where appropriate.  Period of performance is one year from date of award.
