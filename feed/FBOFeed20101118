<DESC>USARAF requires anti-terrorism subject matter expert support services to provide timely access to information, standard and automated processes, and the ability to share information rapidly with higher, subordinate and parallel levels of command.  Execution of these tasks requires a high level of skill and knowledge and awareness of DOD, Department of the Army, AFRICOM antiterrorism policies and guidance for the accomplishment of tasks of a technical, military and scientific nature.  As the principle advisor for AT efforts, the AT division is charged with the responsibility of developing and implementing comprehensive plans and programs to counter the terrorist threat.  AT is staffed with capable officers, non-commissioned officers and DOD civilians.  However, the significant personnel turnovers; evolving AT program requirements; and the need to rapidly finalize actions impacting on the safety and security of personnel within USARAF has the division confronted with a tangible AT personnel and continuity shortfall.  To provide adequate continuity, coordinated countermeasures, and the effective implementation of AT program directives, the AT division requires the services of AT subject matter experts with extensive and current knowledge of AT/FP directives, extensive relevant experience at the Major Command or higher level staffing documents and policy; and an understanding of the AOR and strategic objectives related to USARAFs and the Army's transformation.

Using alternate equipment would prove costly to the government and to the mission.  Any variance in the parts used on certified systems would jeopardize the certification of the systems and ultimately the mission.
   A firm-fixed-price purchase order is anticipated.   Delivery will be FOB Destination NSWC PCD.  NAICS Code 334417 applies. FSC is 1904.  SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-line-height-alt: 10.2pt; tab-stops: .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in"><br />The contract shall be solicited as a 1-year base contract, with the possibility of four (4) 1-year options, for a potential contract period total of five (5) years.</p>
<p>The Government will provide the space, lighting, heating and air-conditioning, major equipment and major equipment repairs.</p>
<p>This will be a no-cost contract. Cafeteria/Concession Services are procured on a profit and loss (P &amp; L) type basis. In addition, the operator is limited to a 10% profit and administrative expense. A wage determination from the Department of Labor will specify minimum wages to be paid to cafeteria employees.</p>
<p>The selected contractor shall be responsible for remitting a 1-1/2% fee of gross sales to the government. On average, the current operator reports $540,000 in annual sales.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: The applicable NAICS code is 722310, Food Service Contractors, and the small business size standard is $20.5 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>This procurement will be issued as Full and Open Competition. FAR 19 is not applicable to food service contracts. Food services are a non-appropriated activity. This is based on a prior opinion by Office of General Counsel that the set-aside requirement is not applicable because concession contracts do not involve the expenditure of appropriated funds. It is also based on Controller General decision B-253161, August 19, 1993.</p>
<p>Contractors interested in obtaining a copy of the solicitation package will be able to download electronic copies of the Request for Proposal (RFP), on or about December 3, 2010 on (www.fbo.gov).&nbsp;</p>

The robotic serial polishing system shall be able to automatically mechanically polish, clean, and dry a single sample for serial sectioning experiments (i.e., the same sample is repeatedly polished, possibly etched, cleaned, and then moved to a transfer point on the polishing system) without any human intervention. The system shall be capable of applying 4 different types of liquid polishing suspension, including one that is capable of dispensing colloidal silica and cleaning the dispenser to avoid clogging, and the combination of polishing platen and suspension solution shall be capable of being defined by the user. The system shall have a minimum of eight polishing platens, and the platen diameter shall be 12" or larger to provide longer lifetime between pad changes. The robotic serial polishing system shall have a mechanism to maximize polishing platen alignment (the platen vertical run-out shall be less than 10 micrometers). In addition, sample polishing conditions such as sample sweep, sample rotation, and platen rotation speed shall be controlled by the user, and the sample load shall be user-defined from 5 to 25 N. The system shall be capable of cleaning between polishing steps using an ultrasonic bath that contains either water or alcohol-based solutions. The system shall be capable of drying the sample using a compressed gas to eliminate spotting on the metallographic surface due to liquid evaporation. <br /><br />b. The robotic serial polishing system shall have a sample holder that has lateral dimensions no greater than 70 mm in diameter, and no greater than 50 mm in height (without sample attached), in order to maintain compatibility with an automated load lock installed on a Tescan Vega XMH Scanning Electron Microscope that is a component of the larger serial sectioning device.<br /><br />c. The robotic serial polishing system shall be supplied with a PC and monitor, as well as software to run the polishing, etching, and cleaning system. The robotic serial polishing system shall be able to be communicated-with-and-controlled via Ethernet networking, and shall allow the user to remotely initiate the polishing, etching, and cleaning sequence, using a user-defined recipe that can be changed and modified via the remote network. <br /><br />d. The robotic serial polishing system shall contain an etching system to selectively reveal microstructural features such as grains or precipitates using acidic solutions (e.g., those containing significant concentrations of nitric, sulfuric, and hydrofluouric acid). The system shall have a pumping system to fill or recirculate the etching solutions. A neutralizing bath shall be available to stop the etching process. The system shall have a ventilation mechanism to vent the gases from the etching system to a user-supplied ventilation duct.<br /><br />e. The robotic serial polishing system shall be capable of automatically loading or unloading the sample holder from the polishing head to a fixed location on the system, to load the sample holder, perform the polishing sequence automatically and without human intervention, and return the sample to the same loading point so that a 3rd party robot manipulator can move the sample holder to other components of the larger serial sectioning device.<br /><br />f. The system shall be provided with a warranty period for a total of 5 years that covers all parts, all labor, and service technician travel expenses, and unlimited emergency service visits.<br /><br />g.

Cables are identical except for length. The cable assembly consists of 2 lengths of cordage, with a fuze plug on one end of each and a 1 1/2 inch plastic receptacle that joins the other end of each.  The cable assembly is difficult to produce to the exacting First Article and Lot Acceptance Test parameters.  Although the M70 cable family may appear similar to other commercial cables in the marketplace, testing in harsh environmental conditions (extreme temperatures, salt fog, etc.)  It is necessary to determine if the Cables meet the performance requirements. Any potential producer must have a highly trained, experienced workforce whom possesses the critical, specialized skills and processes required to manufacture and test the cable assemblies.<BR><BR>The technical data package (TDP) is classified as Distribution D - limited distribution.  Distribution Statement D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet.  This TDP contains technical data whose import is restricted by the arms export control act.

<DESC><p>This is a sources sought notice for Threat Finance Analysis and Sanctions Support Services in Support of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).</p>
<p>This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) marshals the department's intelligence and enforcement functions with the twin aims of safeguarding the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue nations, terrorist facilitators, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferators, money launderers, drug kingpins, and other national security threats. Subordinate offices carry out these responsibilities: <br /><br />The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. <br /><br />The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) has the mission to support the formulation of policy and execution of Treasury authorities by providing expert analysis and intelligence production on financial and other support networks for terrorist groups, proliferators, and other key national security threats and timely, accurate, and focused intelligence support on the full range of economic, political, and security issues. <br /><br />The Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC), which works across all elements of the national security community - including the law enforcement, regulatory, policy, diplomatic and intelligence communities - and with the private sector and foreign governments to identify and address the threats presented by all forms of illicit finance to the international financial system.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Treasury has an ongoing requirement for support to efforts in analysis, investigation, enforcement and policy development and customer outreach to assist TFI with accomplishing its operational goals.</p>
<p>The eight major areas where TFI is currently seeking expertise are:<br /><br />1. Sanctions Investigation Support, which requires the research, documentation and analysis of complex financial and other activities, relationships, and holdings of terrorist organizations, narcotics trafficking organizations, proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, malign regimes, non-state actors, and their agents; and assisting in identifying vulnerabilities of these groups to sanctions and other actions. This work may include reviewing and analyzing a wide range of financial and business data and developing and writing extensive strategic analysis which will support the designation of specific persons as Specially Designated Nationals and applying U.S. and multi-lateral sanctions to them and the production of administrative records documenting the factual and legal basis for such action.<br /><br />2. Sanctions Enforcement Support, which involves the research, analysis, and documentation of possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC to support USG Enforcement actions. Research often involves national or international commercial trade or banking operations. This work may include reviewing and analyzing information, the drafting of memoranda evaluating enforcement responses, making recommendations for the Government's consideration, and coordinating information across other government agencies and offices.<br /><br />3. Transaction Licensing Support, which facilitates the process of reviewing requests for authorization to conduct transactions which are generally prohibited by existing sanctions programs and licensing those which are consistent with U.S. foreign policy. Services may include analyzing requests and making recommendations regarding exceptions to OFAC-administered sanctions programs, especially those related to Iran (including proliferation and terrorism), transnational illicit finance, or narcotics trafficking and drafting for Government review licenses, denials, or interpretive guidance in response to exception requests.<br /><br />4. Sanctions Compliance and Evaluation Support, which assists the investigation of violations of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Acountability and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) and other apparent violations of OFAC administered sanctions programs. The contractor may also assist in recommending new enforcement/evaluation methods or initiatives affecting the financial sector, predicting sanctions-related vulnerabilities within the industry, and reacting to sophisticated sanctions evasion techniques.<br /><br />5. Financial Community Outreach Support, which enables the production of media in a variety of formats for use by Treasury to explain office programs and initiatives. Media will be targeted at government officials and private sector parties within the US and in other countries. Media will require translation to local languages and be sensitive to target audience culture and mores. This may also require support to prepare, organize and conduct electronic outreach events, such as webinars, and the organization, coordination and support of symposia for the public and private sectors for presentations by US Treasury personnel and invited attendees.<br /><br />6. Sanctions Policy Support, which includes providing advisory support regarding the development of economic sanctions policy. Support may include creating written analysis of current and future sanctions efforts and their impact, including areas for change. It may also require the creation of draft briefing and discussion materials on current sanctions programs which will inform efforts by the sponsor to support senior government personnel and to inform external audiences.<br /><br />7. Freedom of Information Act Request Processing, which supports OFAC in its FOIA (5 USC 552) and PA (5 USC 552a) requests processing, document review, agency coordination, draft correspondence preparation and document/information release recommendations. Support may include the review of FOIA/PA requests to obtain associated responsive document located within OFAC divisions, review relevant records, reconcile divergent office/agency responses and prepare documents for release, subject to government authority review.<br /><br />8. Policy Support on Iran Financial Sanctions, which supports the development of financial sanctions policy regarding Iran with policy responsibility for all aspects of Treasury's anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) programs, sanctions efforts, and special projects such as anti-kleptocracy, counter-proliferation financing and counter-insurgency financing initiatives. The contractor will work closely with offices within Treasury, and with relevant U.S. agencies. Support may include assisting in identifying illicit finance trends being deployed by Iran to facilitate proliferation and/or evade sanctions, and proposing policy options to counter this activity. Work may also require analyzing or drafting policy and position papers, and drafting briefing materials to assist in supporting senior Treasury officials, and in supporting international initiatives. Contractor may also review and analyze relevant legislation and policy initiatives, and assist in developing relevant strategies for implementing such laws and policies.<br /><br />The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of the interest, capabilities, and qualifications of prospective offerors in support of the service areas described above. Treasury is particularly interested in understanding the capabilities and qualifications of interested small business concerns. Treasury's choice of solicitation vehicle and acquisition strategy will depend in part upon the responses to this notice of all firms including small businesses.<br /><br />Interested vendors are requested to provide a written response to this notice which is limited to a maximum of 9 pages with a minimum font size of 10 point, one page covering all information necessary to address items 1 - 4 below, and one page per each of the eight categories (items 5 and 6 below).

Treasury intends to provide such a list to any prospective offeror upon request. As a result, any firm that responds to this sources sought notice should indicate whether it consents to its inclusion on such a publicly-available list. The list may be posted at the government point-of-entry (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).<br /><br />The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611. <br /><br />Treasury anticipates that the forthcoming solicitation will require offerors to provide information on the capabilities of their firms, key personnel, resources, past performance, and labor rates offered for each category on which they would like to propose. TFI anticipates needing ongoing support with current and future programs. Treasury anticipates the resultant contract award will be issued for a period of one base year plus four renewable option years. Treasury intends to continue to post additional information in regards to requirements on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fedbizopps.gov) as it becomes known.<br /><br />Interested prospective offerors must respond to this sources sought notice no later than 2:00 P.M. ET on December 22, 2010. Responses and information in response to this notice must be sent via e-mail to Patrick.Breen@do.treas.gov. Telephone inquiries shall be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>Statement of Work<br />Security Evaluation and Preparation of Documents for C &amp; A Certification<br />NIH Biomedical Translational Research Information System
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda, Maryland. The NIH Clinical Center provides patient care and research support for over 1300 active clinical research protocols of the intramural program. These clinical protocols represent a wide variety of research questions posed by investigators from each of the institutes and centers comprising the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>In August of 2004, the Clinical Center implemented a new hospital information system for orders, results and documentation. Entitled the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS); this large enterprise system supports all patient care activities within the NIH Clinical Center. Ancillary systems supporting radiology, surgery, lab, nutrition and admissions provide a suite of tools to provide electronic support for all aspects of patient care. All data through the CRIS system is organized by patient. Each patient is assigned to one or more protocols and all data collected is assigned to a specific protocol.</p>
<p>The current CRIS system provides information on a patient basis. The Biomedical Translational Research Information System or BTRIS is an NIH enterprise project and is designed to provide researchers access to all patient data from CRIS as well as other NIH intramural systems. This allows researchers access to data across one protocol, or multiple protocols. Access to larger data sets are possible allowing for data mining and hypothesis generation. Ultimately, BTRIS will enable the NIH intramural program to share data with outside organizations such as FDA, CTSA partners and other extramural collaborators.</p>
<p>BTRIS received a full security clearance and authority to operate on 7/30/2010. Therefore, BTRIS is a mixed lifecycle system requiring attention to ongoing security concerns based on NIH requirements as well as new security issues related to development activities. As an NIH enterprise system containing personally identifiable information, BTRIS must continue to meet all security requirements as stipulated by the Privacy Act as well a meet regulatory rules for clinical research.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center Nutrition Department is conducting a Market Survey/Sources Sought to help determine the availability of qualified businesses to provide Food Distribution Services for meals to patients undergoing research/treatment at the Mark O Hatifeld Clinical Research Center (CRC).  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 424490.  This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposal and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in the acquisition strategy of procurement of the services.  This is strictly a market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this survey.  The Government will not pay for any cost incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this survey.

The NIH Clinical Center Department intends to procure Food Distribution Services in order to provide meals to patients undergoing research/treatment.  Clinical Center patients, whether on an inpatient unit, a day hospital bed or in the outpatient clinics are offered meals and nourishments to meet individualized need.  Because patients being followed at the NIH Clinical Center are undergoing research, the Nutrition Department must not only ensure that patients receive the best nutritional care but also they ensure the integrity of research protocols related nutrition.  Therefore the contractor must be able to provide a significant match of the current food products (greater than 75%) so that new review on food products nourishments do not have to be completed and the department is able to continue to meet all regulatory requirements.  Every food item, product, nourishment undergoes a comprehensive review by a Registered Dietitian before it can be added to a specialized database, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Nutrition Department is in compliance with all regulatory requirements for safe patient care. 

The Food Distributor must provide the NIH Clinical Center with the necessary food/food products and services with the prescribed timeframes in order to provide meals to patients undergoing research treatment in the CRC.  The CRC is a 242 bed hospital with a 90 day hospital bed component as well as outpatients.  Approximately 7000 inpatients visits occur per year and 100,000 outpatient visits.  The Clinical Center patients whether on an inpatient unit, a day hospital bed or in the outpatient clinics are offered meals and nourishments to meet individualized needs.  The Nutrition Department operates with Room Service menus.  The department has a state of the art food management computer system that allows the service of regular and therapeutic diets, as well as diets for research protocols.  This system is populated with all food, products, nourishments that are provided to patients undergoing research/treatment in the CRC.  

1.  The most significant capability must be to demonstrate is the ability to provide greater than 75% of the current approved Room Service Menu food/ products/ingredients nourishments currently in use by the NIH Clinical Center Nutrition Department.

2. Must also demonstrate the capability to provide the items according to the requested delivery schedule which is Monday through Thursday between the hours of 6:00am  12:00noon (earliest time preferred).

3. Must have the capability with experience and understanding of the Room Service menu concept.

4. The capability in providing Food Distribution Services to hospitals of comparable size of at least 242 beds capacity.

5. The capability of providing a health system specialist with at least 3-5 year experience working in hospital environments of comparable size to the NIH.

The vendor responses shall include specifics that are relevant to the information related to the requirement of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this announcement.  Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform and address the criteria and how it relates in your ability to provide the specialized services.   Include whether you are a large or small business.  Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as proprietary information.

Vendors must send written capability responses by November 24, 2010 by 10:00 AM local time  to either Deborah Britton, Contracting Officer at the following email dbritton@cc.nih.gov or Deborah Culpepper at dculpepper@cc.nih.gov .

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (EPA/OAM) is conducting market research (for informational purposes only) to identify potential small business sources (including 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns) with the capacity and technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirements described herein.
The subject requirement will provide laboratory assay and related scientific technical support for EPA?s Office of Science Coordination and Policy (OSCP).  These services are currently provided by the incumbents, Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG), Research Triangle Institute (RTI), and Battelle Memorial Institute, under EPA contracts EPW06025, EPW06026, and EPW06032, respectively.    Notwithstanding the Government?s option to exercise term extensions, the current contracts are scheduled to expire April/May 2011.  
The proposed acquisition is valued at approximately $25 million, including all options.  The Government anticipates awarding as a five year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) labor-hour contract, in accordance with the procedured under FAR Part 15 - ?Contracting by Negotiation?.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541720.  The small business size standard for this NAICS category is $7.0 million in annual receipts (or income) as defined under 13 CFR ? 121.104.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a sources sought notice for written information only.  The purpose of this notice is to invite interested small business concerns to submit a brief capability statement, delineating a business approach for meeting the requirements in the draft Statement of Work (SOW).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. 
Capability statements must address technical competencies, and management/personnel experience relative to: (1) the key task areas in the draft SOW; and (2) the overall business demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules.  In addition, capability statements must address the concern?s capacity to manage the anticipated volume of work for this requirement.  Finally, general financial and organizational information should be provided with regard to the following items: (1) average number of employees of the concern; (2) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; and (3) a description of other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.). 
Interested parties should be concise in their capability statements, and limit responses to no more than 15 pages.  Capability statements should be responsive to all information items requested herein to allow for an accurate business assessment.  Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the Statement of Work (SOW) will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice.  Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements; and no telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses should be sent via email to marityan.stefan@epa.gov and bushta.dennisjames@epa.gov.  The deadline for submitting capability statements is December 30, 2010, 3:00 PM, ET. 
Additional information for this requirement, including a draft Statement of Work (SOW), will be available at the following website approximately five business days after issuance of this notice: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1110235/index.htm

S. Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Departmental Office of Civil Rights (S-30) is considering the POSSIBILITY of awarding up to approximately three (3) new sole-source contracts to SBA-certified 8(a) firms, for the provision of EEO investigative support services to S-30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, DOT's search for such 8(a) firms, in the applicable GSA Schedule, has turned up only a very small pool of 8(a) firms to choose from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, this Sources Sought Notice broadens DOT's search for qualified 8(a) firms-and regardless of whether such firms are listed on any GSA Schedule. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In other words, an 8(a) firm need NOT necessarily be listed on any GSA Schedule, in order to receive consideration, by DOT, under this Special Notice. Any SBA-certified 8(a) firm that is interested in rendering such EEO investigative support services to S-30 shall, not later than 11:59 PM Eastern Time on Sunday, December 5, 2010, e-mail, to <a href="mailto:james.mowery@dot.gov">james.mowery@dot.gov</a> and to <a href="mailto:Sharlean.webb@dot.gov">Sharlean.webb@dot.gov</a> , the following materials: (a) a Statement of Qualifications designed to prove, to S-30, that the submitting 8(a) company is fully QUALIFIED to render such EEO investigative support services in accordance with the Statement of Work which appears below in this Special Notice; (b) resumes for each of, and for all of, the individual named staff members whom the submitting 8(a) firm estimates would be serving on any EEO investigative support services contract awarded by DOT to the submitting company; (c) a table showing the submitting company's ESTIMATED fully-loaded hourly pay rates for each such named individual staff member; (d) a citation of any relevant GSA-Schedule-Contract which the submitting company happens to hold; and (e) a list of Past Performance References, including the titles or subject areas of each relevant past project performed by the submitting company, and including the contract numbers or project numbers of those past projects, and including the name and title and phone number and e-mail address of a customer-contact-person for each of those past projects; and (f) a copy of the signed SBA-letterhead letter that placed the submitting company in the 8(a) program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PLEASE NOTE THAT RESPONDERS AND PROSPECTIVE RESPONDERS TO THIS NOTICE MUST NOT CALL OR ATTEMPT TO CONTACT DOT'S MS. SHARLEAN WEBB----except for the LIMITED purpose of e-mailing a Statement of Qualifications to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, DOT is NOT, at the present time, asking for submission of full PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is NOT anticipated that any Statement of Qualifications submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice will constitute a full PROPOSAL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, DOT may HEREAFTER request a full PROPOSAL from any particular 8(a) firm whose Statement of Qualifications, submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice, indicates that the firm is one of the responders whose service on an EEO support services contract would be most advantageous to DOT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The following is the Statement of Work for the POTENTIAL EEO support services envisioned in this Sources Sought Notice:</p>

<DESC>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase agreement to Dominion Federal (a small business). The vendor shall provide monthly lease and maintenance of permanent office facilities at United States Central Command (CENTCOM) using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Dominion Federal is the only responsible source. This action is required to retain and maintain existing critical/mission essential work space that was constructed to directly support the Iraq War effort beginning in 2006. Because those efforts have now been re-directed to support troops in the continuing war against terrorism in Afghanistan, this facility is required for an additional unknown period of time. This 72,000 square foot modular office complex was constructed and configured to the specialized needs of the end-user. Costs are not expected to be recouped through re-competion of this requirement. Therefore, negotiations with the owner of the 91 modular units which make up this mission critical complex/facility is in the best interest of the Government. The period of performance for this purchase order will include a 2-month base period and two 1-month option periods.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted using various methods to include: Internet searches and telephone inquiries. No vendor expressed interest in participating in the requirement. The Government intends to award a one-time purchase agreement to vendor specified above. The North American Industry Classification System is 531120 and the size standard is 7 million. "This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in proposal preparation. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to a previous notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The 6th Contracting Squadron will post this notice until 1:00 pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) 30 November 2010 and intends to award purchase agreement after expiration of this notice. Note: No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 1/8, Pacific, intends to negotiate directly with Aqua Treasures USA, LLC, 7360 Lynden, Washington 98264-9418 for a follow-on research project to perform aquatic species assessments and monitoring of Mysis in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.  The result of negotiations between the government and Aqua Treasures, LLC is expected to result in award of a firm fixed-priced purchase order that will contain a period of performance of not more than 365 calendar days.
The project's work will be performed in close coordination with the requirements of the Lake Tahoe Regional Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan(TRPA), as well as the statement of work requirements of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The objectives of the project will be to gather data and assess the success of re-establishing a naturally reproducing Lahontan Cutthroat Trout(LCT) population with extant non-native trout populations, other non-native aquatic species, and existing aquatic species.  Initial research performed under a previous contract with the vendor has resulted in a portion of an overall project that will entail multiple eco-system analysis, and the follow-on project will utilizing data that was partially developed under work performed by the contractor.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Aqua Treasures, LLC has been determined to possess exclusive deep water alpine monitoring and sampling technologies and methodologies.  The firm possesses over ten years of specific monitoring experience related to Mysis, utilizes unique methodologies and techniques, and possesses previous data resulting from a previous project that must be compiled and included in the currently contemplated projects' final deliverables.  No other firm is known to possess the prior data or developed research methodologies and techniques required by the government, much of which is proprietary and only in the possession obtainable from Aqua Treasures, LLC.  Further, the firm is the only known capable of performing all aspects of the required statement of work within the time period specified and capable of providing final deliverables in report format inclusive of all data both obtained resulting from previous work, and during the contemplated project's period of performance of 365 calendar days.
Market research has not resulted in the location of additional firms with the required experience, previous data, and methodologies required to conduct the contemplated project.  Actions taken to located capable alternatives to Aqua Resources, LLC were a thorough search or existing government sources, seeking project support from governing agencies, a search of www.bpn.gov/ccr, review of existing Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC), and review of sources available from the General Services Administration.  The result of this market research has not resulted in the location of any firms capable or in the possess on the required proprietary data maintained by Aqua Resources, LLS, and obtained during the previous contracts period of performance. Further competition is not expected to result in additional price savings, or a more favorable services than those being contemplated by Aqua Resources, LLC.  Therefore, the government intends to negotiate only with the only known source to obtain favorable pricing and contract terms for the follow-on project.
This announcement is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals and the government does not intend to accept proposals or quotes received.  Completion of negotiations and award of purchased order is anticipated to occur within the next 15 calendar days.

<DESC>Bruin &amp; Sponge Creek AOP Synopsis
<p>The Umatilla National Forest will be advertising two Aquatic Organism Passage Improvement projects for implementation in 2011. The following projects may be combined under the same advertisement.</p>
<p>Project Name: Bruin &amp; Sponge Creek Aquatic Organism Passages</p>
<p>Project Locations:</p>
<p>Bruin Creek: Approximately 75 miles south of Pendleton, OR. Take Exit 209 on Interstate 84 and head south on U.S. Hwy 395 for 61.3 miles. Turn left onto Forest Road 55 and continue .7 miles. Turn right onto Forest Road 10. Continue on Forest Road 10 for 12.51 miles and arrive at Bruin Creek.</p>
<p>Sponge Creek: Follow directions above to Bruin Creek. From Bruin Creek, continue on Forest Road 10 for 5.2 miles and arrive at Sponge Creek.</p>
<p>Project Start Date: The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) in-stream work window for these locations is July 15th to August 15th. Work that has no influence on the stream can begin prior to the in-stream work window. All in-stream work must be completed within this work window. Any time extension of the in-stream work window must be approved by ODFW.</p>
<p>Project Background</p>
<p>Bruin Creek passes under Forest Road 10 through a corrugated metal pipe (CMP) with a horizontal dimension of 72" and a vertical dimension of 82". The CMP is approximately 102.2' in length. This structure currently is a barrier to T&amp;E and native fish.</p>
<p>Sponge Creek passes under Forest Road 10 through a 78" CMP that is approximately 64.1' long. This structure currently is a barrier to T&amp;E and native fish.</p>
<p>Project Description: Work at both of these sites includes the removal of the above mentioned existing culverts and the installation of a precast/prefabricated structure. Also included is stream simulation work in the channel. This work includes placing rock for steps and streambed. De-watering is required for these projects. This includes re-directing the creek for the duration of the project and installing erosion and pollution controls devices during installation of the new structures and stream simulation work.</p>
<p>The Umatilla National Forest intends on advertising these projects during the winter months so that adequate time will be given to the awarded contractor to acquire the appropriate materials and be prepared to complete all work within the allotted in-stream work window. For this reason it is strongly recommended that all interested/prospective contractors visit each site before they become inaccessible due to weather.</p>
<p>Attached are plans from similar projects that have been completed in the same general area. The Battle Creek site in the attached plans is similar to the Bruin Creek site and the Lucas Gulch site in the plans is similar to the Sponge Creek site. Note: These drawings are to be used as an example only. It is strongly recommended that all interested parties visit each site.&nbsp; <br /><br />When this posted as a solicitation the solicitation number will change.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE purchase order using the simplified acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 13.  The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order to Capital Communications, 600 West Capitol Ave, Little Rock, AR 72203 for wire installation for the IRS located at 700 W. Capitol Ave., Little Rock, AR 72201.   

This requirement is being made on a non-competitive basis for the following reasons: (1) this wiring project will be completed in four different phases.  The wiring for Phase 1 has been completed by Capital Communications; therefore, this is considered a logical follow on for completion of the other phases; (2) phase 2 must be completed in December 2010 to prepare for the filing season in January 2011 to accommodate tax payers; (3) since the wiring for phases 2 through 4 involves work to be performed in secured areas, the selected contractor must have security clearances before performing work.  Capital Communications already has security clearance, which will allow the contractor to start working on the wiring installation without delay. 
 
Responses to this synopsis will be evaluated by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability and respond to the requirement no later than 10:00 AM EST, November 19, 2010. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Questions should be directed to Sheila Balkaran, Contract Specialist, in writing via email at Sheila.Balkaran@irs.gov.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information: National Guard Counterdrug Program Drug Demand Reduction Educational Program 
<SOLNBR>W9133L-11-D-9876
<RESPDATE>121510
<CONTACT>James E. Buchanan, Phone 7036044189, Email James.Buchanan4@us.army.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Applicability:<br />This Request for Information is being issued in accordance with the terms of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, specifically FAR Subpart 15.2-Solicitation and Receipt of Proposals and Information.
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the National Guard Bureau Counterdrug Program (NGCP) will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NGCP nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.<br />NGCP recognizes the interest by substance abuse prevention experts, community based coalitions, and other appropriate organizations in the acquisition of NGCP Drug Demand Reduction (DDR) prevention programs. <br />This RFI is being used to gather market research for NGCP and provide information from educational institutions, community-based and other appropriate organizations about current and trending research based and proven effective drug &amp; substance abuse prevention programs. <br />NGCP may use the results of this RFI to determine interest in an Industry Day where NGCP personnel and Drug Demand Reduction experts will be on-hand to view and comment on prevention programs being presented. If enough interest is generated, a Request for Proposal may follow.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The National Guard provides Counterdrug support approved by the Secretary of Defense within the fifty-four states and territories. With each states' Governors' approval, support is provided to federal, state, and local Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), Community Based Organizations (CBOs), educational, and government organizations that request assistance. The NGCP recognizes the importance of research-based and proven, effective prevention programs. It's for this reason NGCP is searching for programs which are "evidence-based" and have a universal approach to a varied target audience. They must be flexible, culturally competent and sustainable by the National Guard state programs, community coalitions, and/or educational institutions. Programs must also focus on children's social and academic skills, including enhancing peer relationships, self-control, coping and drug-refusal skills.</p>
<p>"Evidence-based" programs are defined by NGCP as having prevention methodologies that have been developed and evaluated using scientific processes. Experts use commonly agreed upon criteria for rating interventions, reaching a consensus that evaluation research findings are credible and sustainable. It is also referred to as science-based and research-based models. NGCP considers programs which are listed in the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP) as "evidence-based."</p>
<p>What Is NREPP?</p>
<p>The National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP) is a searchable online registry of mental health and substance abuse intervention programs that have been reviewed and rated by independent reviewers. The purpose of this registry is to assist the public in identifying approaches to preventing and treating mental and/or substance use disorders that have been scientifically tested and that can be readily disseminated to the field. NREPP is one way that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is working to improve access to information on tested interventions and thereby reduce the time lag between the creation of scientific knowledge and its practical application in the field. <br />Special Considerations:<br />It should be noted that the organizations which ultimately respond to this RFI must offer a Commercial Off-the-Shelf program which is measurable; can be tailored for National Guard use; can be taught by National Guardsmen; is easily duplicable and scientifically measurable. It must also be researched; validated as a substance abuse prevention program; proven to reduce the risks of alcohol, tobacco, drug abuse and violence by targeting the major social and psychological factors that support the initiation of substance use and other risky behaviors.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI:<br />Organizations responding to this RFI must be: 1) Registered and validated in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), 2.) Listed in the NREPP. <br />RFI responses must include:<br />&bull;Name of primary point of contact for the response<br />&bull;Organization's title<br />&bull;Email address<br />&bull;Phone<br />&bull;Identification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response<br />&bull;A brief description of your program (500 word limit)<br />&bull;List the goals/objectives of your program (500 word limit)<br />&bull;Explain the target population &amp; age group (500 word limit)<br />&bull;Give information or research designating the program as one with promising outcomes (5 page limit)<br />&bull;A brief summary (500 word limit) description of previous relevant experience in Drug Demand Reduction educational programs</p>
<p>RFI Questions:</p>
<p>NGB-Counterdrug is requesting responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1.Would your organization be interested in presenting your Drug Demand Reduction educational program during an Industry Day?</p>
<p>2.Please explain your organizations current impact nationwide.

Eppley is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for the Eppley Precision Infrared Radiometer and Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer sensors.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 12:00pm Noon on 23 November 2010.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  For Technical inquiries, please contact Mark Graves, Mark.R.Graves@usace.army.mil.

Leonard Wood, MO and Yuma Proving Ground, AZ, and the subsequent Geo Envrionmental Tactical Simulation (GEOTACS) program.  Stations have been used to collect data to be used for validation data to drive the development of the computational test bed to support improvised explosive device (IED) and other military research.  Additional stations are required to allow collection of data at more sites so that areas representing a broader array or environmental conditions can be modeled.  <BR><BR>2. The expansion of project test areas requires four (4) more PIRs and six (6) more PSPs to be used with the Eppley Precision Infrared Radiometer (PIR) and Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP).  To maintain consistency with current data acquisition systems and to insure direct compatibility with installed systems, it is recommended that these sensors be purchased from Eppley Laboratory, Inc.

<DESC>Notice of Intent for Sole Source<BR><BR>The Southern Regional Contracting Office, Brooke Army Medical Center intends to award a sole source contract to the CYTYC Corporation for the purchase of the Fetal Fibronectin Enzyme Immunoassay and Rapid fFN for the TLi IQ System currently required in support of Darnall Army Community Hospital, Fort Hood, TX.  Clinical research indicates that the fetal fibronectin test is the top predictor of preterm births. Preterm delivery, which occurs in approximately 10% of live births, is one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality, with healthcare costs exceeding $5 billion annually.  Concerns for the health and well being of the mother and infant as well as the economic implications (i.e. hospitalization, use of drug therapy and subsequent medical care following delivery) make the diagnosis and management of preterm delivery one of the most challenging problems in obstetrics.  The Fetal Fibronectin test is used to identify the risk of preterm birth in three categories: women experiencing signs and symptoms for preterm delivery, high-risk pregnancies, and low-risk pregnancies. The Fetal Fibronectin Test, must include consumables, controls, calibrators, training, maintenance, and technical support.  The TLi IQ System provides optimal performance and enables Darnall Army Community Hospital to maintain and continue to provide superior healthcare services to the warfighter and patients.  Award will be made on or about 29 Nov 2010, contract period of performance will be from 1Jan 2011 through 30 Sep 2011.<BR><BR>NOTE:  INTERESTED VENDORS, MAY RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE ON OR BEFORE 22 NOV 10, 1:00PM, CST.

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Diversity.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

The following Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Clauses are incorporated in full text: DOJ ORDER 2640.F, BOP Clause (June 2004): The Department of Justice does not permit the use of Non-U.S. citizens in the performance of this contract or commitment for any position that involves access to or development of any DOJ IT System, unless a waiver has been granted by the Department of Justice, Chief Information Officer. By signing this document, or beginning performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction. DOJ Residency Requirement BOP Clause (June 2004)- For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have: 1) legally resided in the U.S.; 2) worked for the U.S. overseas in a federal or military capacity; or 3) been a dependent of a federal or military employee serving overseas. If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.; Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency (MAY 2008) During a Pandemic or other emergency, we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of<br />absenteeism as our Federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to Federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. The types of actions a Federal contractor should reasonably take<br />to help ensure performance are: &bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other<br />preventive measures as advised by the public health service. &bull; Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly<br />important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. &bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. &bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their<br />roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. &bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of<br />activation of this plan. &bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into<br />telework agreements. &bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home<br />(supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid<br />use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. &bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform<br />and to work with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, the Contracting Officer's<br />Technical Representative, via telephone or e-mail messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the BOP in estimating the<br />adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the BOP to develop a strategy for maintaining continuity of operations. The BOP does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contracting<br />support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of<br />Federal Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", dated May 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. (End of Clause).<br />Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations (Aug 2005), Faith-based and Community-based organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. (End of Clause). Each quoter shall include a completed copy of the FAR Provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009) with their quote or document. The Representations and Certifications are available on ORCA. The following FAR Provision is applicable to this acquisition: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items (Jan 2006). All quotes shall be submitted to the email address egorman@bop.gov or by facsimile at 202-307-1146, no later than November 29, 2010 @ 10:00 a.m., EST. All quotes shall be clearly marked with RFQ-NAS-0098-2011. All quoters are hereby notified that if your quote is not received by the date/time and at the location specified in this notice, it will not be considered. The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Elizabeth Gorman, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed above. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone requests or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content). 1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.": United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions and Systems Section. Requiring Office: United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Information Policy and Public Affairs Division, Office of Information Systems (OIS). 2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: The BOP, OIS has a requirement for the maintenance renewal of 344 new users software licenses for the Stedman Plus Medical/Pharmaceutical Spell checker, 2010 ASCII Word List, and the acquisitions of an additional 3711 User's Upgrade, Stedman's Plus Medical/Pharmaceutical Spell checker, 2010 Stedman's ASCII Word List for new users. The Medical Pharmaceutical Spell checker Software is utilized and incorporated with the BOP's existing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. The BOP requires the Stedman Pharmaceutical Software for use with the EMR system currently in use by the BOP. The software maintenance services licenses and additional new users include: all new software releases; system updates; program temporary fixes (PTF's); documentation updates; and toll-free hot-line support 24 hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance. 3. A Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, it is determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The BOP requires the renewal for software maintenance and acquisition of additional licenses for the Stedman Plus Pharmaceutical Spell checker software for the EMR system. The software will be part of the current system. In addition, the EMR system is a rights protected system, and the EMR software vendor utilizes the Stedman software as the spell-check feature on the pharmacy module. The Stedman vendor, Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc., owns the proprietary rights for the Pharmaceutical Spell-Checker software and has not authorized this product to be offered for resale by other vendors. The estimated cost of the maintenance and support services are not expected to exceed $44,800.00. 4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of Section 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: This justification and approval is being submitted for approval in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, since there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This acquisition will be posted in FedBizOpps as a combined synopsis/solicitation. The licenses and services to be procured through this acquisition are proprietary to Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. 6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies: This acquisition will be posted in FedBizOpps as a combined synopsis/solicitation. 7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: A review of the proposed price was completed by the contracting officer. Based on the comparison of current and historical acquisition data for similar maintenance renewals and acquisitions of software licenses, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government. The contracting officer has made the determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable. 8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: In accordance with FAR 10.001, Market Research was conducted by both the requiring activity and the contracting officer. It has been determined that if the spell check software and maintenance services for this system is not maintained, it would be detrimental to the BOP, as the Stedman Pharmacy system controls and directs the types and amounts of medication being dispensed to the inmates. The BOP also requires additional licenses for deployment to the BOP medical offices, and to obtain software different from the current software would be detrimental to the overall operation of the BOP EMR system. The BOP will continue to conduct market surveys and make efforts to obtain competition for future acquisitions. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (1) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.<br />10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc., 351 W. Camden Street, Baltimore, MD 21201. 11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: For the reasons made prior, no actions are available to the BOP which could remove competition barriers before subsequent acquisition of the required maintenance and support services. 12. Technical Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Brand Name Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. //s//Earl Franks, Chief, Information Technology Planning and Development. Contracting Officer Certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief: I hereby certify that this request for the Brand Name Justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. //s//Elizabeth S. Gorman, Contract Specialist. Approval: I certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//Greg Sinsel, Senior Contract Specialist, National Acquisitions and Systems Section.</p>

SCA Wage Determination No: 1997-0026 Revision No: 26 dated 06/15/2010, will be made a part of any resulting award. Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to bid every line item.  In determining the most advantageous scenario, the government will evaluate pricing as follows: 1 -  If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging, conference, catering, etc.) and offers the overall lowest price, one award may be made to the one vendor. 2 - While vendors are not required to quote all line items, if a vendor is quoting conference space, they must also quote catering service for the same event. 3 - If no one vendor can accommodate all lodging for an event, in order to be advantageous to the government, the lodging facility(ies) must be located within 5 miles of the facility determined to offer the LPTA conference quote.  For example, if a conference facility in Virginia Beach, VA is able to meet all conference requirements for an event and is determined to be the LPTA conference quote, but is not able to meet the entire lodging requirements, the hotel may subcontract with other hotels within a 5 mile radius which also meet the minimum lodging requirements.  Also, other hotels quoting which are within a 5 mile radius of the LPTA conference facility will be evaluated for potential award for lodging if they are within 5 miles of the LPTA conference facility. 4 - An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards.  This monetary evaluation factor is separate from determining the number of facilities needed to be utilized to meet the requirement which will also be considered in determining if it is advantageous to make multiple awards.  For purposes of price evaluation, if there is a mathematical error in which the unit price multiplied by the quantity does not equal the extended total, the unit price will prevail and be used for evaluation and award purposes.  To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met: (1) The quote must provide for all services which are being quoted (i.e. if quoting the conference, contractor must be able to provide conference space, catering, support equipment, etc.).  (2) Hotel(s) must have on-site parking for at least one vehicle per room reserved or if off-site parking, hotel must provide valet services.  The conference facility shall have parking for 900 vehicles.  (3) Hotel must have at least one operating, full service restaurant on site and/or have full service restaurants located within three blocks of the hotel. (4) Facilities being proposed for lodging and conference must be located in Virginia Beach, VA area.  (5) Lodging facility must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (5) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met. Pricing shall be provided on attached pricing worksheet.  Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Should any term or condition (i.e. number of hours prior to event attendee may cancel reservation, etc.) be altered, offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the governments best interest to accept the proposed alternative. In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided.  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rates proposed by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable offer.  As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. All questions shall be submitted in writing and received by 4:30 p.m. ET, December 3, 2010.  Questions can be sent via email, amy.daniels@langley.af.mil or fax (757)764-4071.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>Dockside Repairs of CGC SEQUOIA (WLB 215)</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-R-P45B22 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-45. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) works in many areas involving ships and shipping, shipbuilding, port operations, vessel operations, national security, environment, and safety. The agency is also charged with maintaining the health of the merchant marine, since commercial mariners, vessels, and intermodal facilities are vital for supporting national security, and so the agency provides support and information for current mariners, extensive support for educating future mariners, and programs to educate America's young people about the vital role the maritime industry plays in the lives of all Americans. The Maritime Administration also maintains a Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet of cargo ships in reserve to provide surge sealift during war and national emergencies, and is responsible for disposing of ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, as well as other non-combatant Government ships, as they become obsolete.<br /><br />The Maritime Administration's Office of Congressional and Public Affairs must expend significant efforts to promote the use of waterborne transportation and its seamless integration with other segments of the transportation system, and the viability of the U.S. merchant marine. This office uses a variety of methods to inform the public about the Department's initiatives including, but not limited to speeches by agency officials, topic-specific articles, informational brochures, news releases, Congressional testimony, stakeholder briefings, online content and other one-way and interactive communications tools. <br />The Maritime Administration's Office of Congressional and Public Affairs requires the services of a dedicated speechwriter primarily to prepare speeches and talking points for the Administrator and Deputy Administrator, who make a high number of presentations and speeches for the administration, but also to assist in the development of material in these other areas to ensure a uniform agency message. The Administrator and Deputy Administrator speak on a range of topics related to the maritime industry including, but not limited to: U.S. Flag matters, Merchant Marines, piracy, the Recovery Act, ship recycling and environmental stewardship, the RRF, the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy, cargo preference, Maritime Security Program, Title XI, and other administration priorities.<br /><br /><strong>Objective<br /></strong>The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain speechwriter services that will include writing and editing speeches, articles, informational brochures, news releases, Congressional testimony, web content, and other written materials. The consultant speechwriter will report to the Director of Congressional and Public Affairs and will collaborate directly with senior agency officials to write, edit, and circulate speeches for approval. <br /><br /><strong>Functions<br /></strong>Become familiar with MARAD's mission, programs and activities. The contractor will use this knowledge to create written materials to communicate these programs and initiatives effectively to public audiences.<br /><br />Write and edit speeches, news releases, topic-specific articles, publications, web content, Congressional testimony, and other materials as assigned.<br /><br />Interview and work closely with MARAD senior leadership and program experts in order to write effective speeches, talking points, articles, Congressional testimony, and other documents that accurately reflect and effectively communicate the programs and objectives of the organization and its leadership.<br /><br />Review publications and materials written by other authors and make recommendations for improvement, or assume ownership of draft documents and make improvements based on the organization's goals, stakeholder needs, and the highest standards for accuracy and excellence.<br /><br /><strong>Deliverables and Schedule<br /></strong>The consultant speechwriter will produce approximately five speeches per week (as needed) for the Administrator and Deputy Administrator, usually, but not always, shorter than 1,500 words. The individual must be sufficiently flexible to participate in meetings and conversations on short notice. The contractor will be expected to submit fully completed products for printing on tight deadlines with reasonable, but often limited lead time. <br /><br /><strong>Reporting Requirements<br /></strong>The contractor will provide written and oral reports during meetings and upon request. The contractor will also provide written documents fulfilling the above tasks as assigned.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quote Submission Instructions<br /></span></strong>Interested parties shall submit a fixed price quote for services described above for the period of one year from time award. The response package shall also include the following:<br /><br />1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For a company quote submission</span>: At least two references (for the company) for the same or similar type and complexity of the services required in the RFQ for work performed during the previous two calendar years.

<p>Q (40) Regarding transition of workload:</p>
<p>a) How much time is the government allowing for transition period?</p>
<p>b) Will a separate DO/TO be issued to cover the transition period?</p>
<p>c) Is the estimated cost (LOE) of transition to be considered for each task or an aggregate of all current tasks?</p>
<p>d) Are there any classified documents or items stored at the incumbent site and need to be transitioned?</p>
<p>A (40)</p>
<p>a) One Month<br />b) Yes<br />c) The transition cost will ONLY be considered on the first order.<br />d) No</p>
<p><br />Q (41) Has the level of work for the current contract increased or decreased over the term of the contract?</p>
<p>A (41) This is not required for proposal submission.</p>
<p>Q (42) What is the current number of contractor personnel performing work in support of these efforts?</p>
<p>A (42) This is not required for proposal submission.</p>
<p>Q (43): How many full time equivalent employees are currently working the effort?</p>
<p>A (43) This is not required for proposal submission.</p>
<p>Q (44) Can you please provide the past years total labor cost to the Government?</p>

<p>Q (45): Can you provide the past years travel and ODC dollars?</p>
<p>A (45) We cannot provide past years travel and ODC dollars.</p>
<p>Q (46) Currently ___ has two FMS contracts dealing with Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF). One is for trainers and does not end until __________2012 and the other is to provide man power support in country to 569 ACSS/GFIA and does not end until __________. I would like to insure that these two contracts do not already constitute a conflict of interest. <br /><br />The answer will determine whether ___ continues working on a bid for this contract. You timely answer will greatly be appreciated.<br /><br />A (46) See RFP amendment 0005 that incorporates OCI clause.</p>
<p>Q (47) A previous question indicated that the successful contractor will be precluded from any work for which they participated in developing requirements IAW PWS paragraph 4.9.3.8. Is it the government's intent to include an OCI clause in Section H at award? If so, which clause does the government intend to include.</p>
<p>A (47) See RFP amendment 0005 that incorporates OCI clause.</p>
<p><br />Q (48) The RFP said nothing about OCI and Para 4.13.3 of the PWS only references "Access to Data:" in regards to conflict of interest. Can potential conflict of interest issues with regards to paragraph 4.13.3 of the PWS be resolved at the task order level? In other words, should a task order contain or potentially contain OCI issues for one partner company (Prime or Sub), can the other partner(s) do the task order work?"</p>
<p>A (48) See RFP amendment 0005 that incorporates OCI clause.</p>
<p>Q (49) Section L of the solicitation requests that, "Offerors shall ensure that all clauses and provisions that require "fill-in" information are appropriately completed, including the proposed prices associated with the contract line items in the Schedule of the RFP."</p>

The Government will calculate a TEP based on the following: For Firm Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs: Offerors will propose fully loaded labor rates in Attachment G (Fully loaded labor rates include base labor rates plus all indirect costs, G&amp;A and profit). The Government will multiply the proposed fully loaded labor rates by an estimated number of hours not to be disclosed to the Offerors. All CLINs (Basic and Options) will be added together to come up with the TEP." <br />If a level of effort is not going to be provided to Offerors, how would the Government like Offerors to complete Section B of the solicitation?</p>
<p>A (49) See RFP amendment 0005.</p>
<p>Q (50) Section 4.4 of the PWs states that, "Travel: The Contractor may be required to travel for the performance of the work described within this PWS. Travel may include locations within the continental United States and outside the continental United States." The PWS provided does not provide enough information for Offerors to reasonably estimate the travel and danger pay required per contract period. <br />Will the Government provide a Not-to-Exceed amount for each applicable CLIN in Section B?</p>
<p>A (50) See RFP amendment 0005.</p>
<p>Q (51) Section 3.1.2 of the PWS states that, "Materials are to be provided by the Contractor when essential to the task performance specifically approved." The PWS provided does not provide enough information for Offerors to reasonably estimate material and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) required per contract period. <br />Will the Government provide a Not-to-Exceed amount for each applicable CLIN in Section B?</p>
<p>A (51) See RFP amendment 0005.</p>
<p>Q (52) FAR clause 52.222-46 states that, "As part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract." Please verify that the Government is requesting numerical values for salary and fringe by labor category over the contract period in order to fulfill this requirement in addition to a written response.</p>

<p>b) PWS Paragraph 4.13.4 3rd sentence reads: "The Contractor's AIS shall be protected such that unauthorized disclosure of classified information or of sensitive, but of unclassified information is prevented."</p>
<p>Is the contractor expected to process classified information on their AIS system? If so, to what extent?</p>
<p>Pease clarify the referenced sentence.</p>
<p>c) Will any of the classified materials fall under NATO classification guidelines?</p>
<p>d) Pursuant to PWS Paragraph 4.13.9,</p>
<p>1) Will the contractor need to develop a COMSEC plan?</p>
<p>2) Will the government provide requisite secure communication devices (i.e. STU-III), if required?</p>
<p>A(53)</p>
<p>a) No<br />b) No<br />c) No<br />d1) Employees will fall under the Government COMSEC plan. <br />d2)Yes, as needed for contractor employees working at Robins AFB.</p>

Or will there be "waivers" allowed for any resources, especially incumbent employees that don't have degrees?</p>
<p>A (54) See RFP amendment 0005 that incorporates waiver request in attached PWS.</p>
<p>Q (55) When are the Past Performance Questionnaires due for FA8505-10-R-21787?</p>
<p>A (55) Reference Section L-900 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS, paragraph B:</p>

(Volume III is due in WR-ALC/830 ACSG/235 Byron Street Suite 19A Robins AFB, GA 31098-1607, Attention: Alexander Comportie, seven (7) calendar days prior to the required due date for proposals. Volumes I, II, and IV of the RFP are due no later than date called out on Block 9 of the face page of the solicitation standard form 1447, 4:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time. However, failure to submit VOLUME III by the earlier date will not result in offeror disqualification."</p>
<p><br />Q(56) I am interested in obtaining a list of your Interested Vendors who have responded to you to date concerning this opportunity. Please respond with the current list if available.</p>
<p>A(56) A listing is not available.</p>
<p>Q (57) Ref Attachment G: How many employees are currently in each of the four labor categories (Administrative Support, Equipment Specialist, Logistics Specialist, Supply Support Specialist)?</p>
<p>A (57) No, this is not required for proposal submission.</p>
<p>Q (58) Ref Attachment G: For each of the employees in the four labor categories (Administrative Support, Equipment Specialist, Logistics Specialist, Supply Support Specialist), what is their current Level?</p>
<p>A (58) No, this is not required for proposal submission.</p>
<p>Q (59) Do all positions require a Secret Clearance?</p>
<p>A (59) Reference PWS paragraph 4.13.2.</p>
<p>Q (60) Will the contractor be required to have a secure IMS?</p>
<p>A (60) No<br /><br />Q (61 ) Are you planning a site visit for this contract FA8505-10-R-21787</p>
<p>A (61) No, a site visit is not planned.</p>
<p>Q (62) In the referenced RFP, we noticed a clause - I-532 52.242-4 CERTIFICATION OF FINAL INDIRECT COSTS (JAN 1997)- was included in the RFP. We are definitely used to seeing that in contracts and as part of our closeout of contracts, but not in the RFP. We are assuming that it is not necessary to complete this as part of the submission package since it addresses activities for administration of the contract and submission of incurred costs. Please clarify.</p>
<p>A (62) It is only applicable if there have been billing rates used and final indirect cost rates must be established. Reference FAR 42.703-2(f)</p>
<p>Q (63) We understand that we are to complete Attachment "G", Proposed Loaded Labor Rates; however, we need to know if the totals for each year (Basic and four option periods) prices should be included on CLINs 0001, and corresponding year CLINs, in section B of the RFP. If not, what pricing data is required for these CLINs.<br /><br />Additionally, are we to provide costs for CLINs 0002 and 0003 in section B of the RFP.</p>
<p>A (63) See RFP amendment 0005 on cost reimbursement no-fee CLINs. Contractor is to propose rates only in Attachment G and attach this to the RFP. FFP Transition CLIN 0006 is to be entered on schedule B.</p>
<p><br />OPTIONS I thru IV were deleted from the RFP because the Letter of Offer and Acceptance between the USG and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not support a five year Period of Performance.</p>

Q. Are contractors open to bid financing options at our own discretion?  E.g.,PBPs, Progress Payments, cost vouchers since the RFP does not indicate whattype of document is required for invoicing and Progress Payments clause(52.232-16) is not included.
A. Financing options will be determined after contract award.
Q. What is the Governments reasoning for using the EPA clause, FAR 52.216-4000 (JM&L 183) Actual Cost method instead of EPA clause FAR 52.216-4001 (JM&L184) Index Method?
A. It is very difficult to establish an index that is precise to the commodityyou are buying (Tungsten). Also, there is a three month lag on the Bureau ofLabor Statistics (BLS) indices and when the indices become actual. It shouldbe noted in regards to the 10% ceiling, the 10% is on the unit price not thecommodity price.
Clarification: Page 23 of 127: Please see the followingcorrections/clarifications:
Propellant Charge Establishment (CE from DTL Para 4.4.4.1) should be 9cartridges, not 24 (per Propellant lot).
Propellant Charge Verification (CV from DTL Para 4.4.4.2) should be 15cartridges, not 20.
Excess Pressure Ballistic Test (EPBT from DTL Para 4.4.10.1) is not listed andwould be required for any new cartridge case production and would be 30cartridges.	Cartridge quantities for Lot 1 & Lot 2 should be TBD based on the ID/IQrequirements.
The LAT lines in this section should read 30 cartridges instead of 45cartridges.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  This information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.
  All qualified concerns that may be interested in performing the proposed project may submit capability statements for consideration.  Based upon response to this announcement and  capability statements, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside, proceed with an unrestricted solicitation or decide on an alternate procurement strategy.  
The Proposed Project
Evaluate, design, and remodel an approximately 2,500 gross square foot visitor center that will result in a "Silver" rated or better certification in accordance with U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  The visitor center is located at Lake Pleasant Regional Park north of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona.  It is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation and managed by Maricopa County Parks and Recreation.
With "water" as the common theme, upgrade visitor center exhibits and experiences to make it a true Lake Pleasant Regional Park "Discovery Center" and key visitor destination. The Goal is to distinguish the "Discovery" Center from other local facilities by capitalizing on the unique environmental, cultural, engineering (New Waddell Dam), natural history, and recreational features found in the Park.
To fulfill the Vision and accomplish the Goal, a variety of issues must be addressed:  utilities need to be upgraded and alternative "Green" solutions should be considered; exhibit, sales, and media areas must be improved, revised and updated; a temporary visitor must be established to provide minimal, limited information to visitors during the remodel; and the existing structure must be used for the upgrade.  
History of the Proposed Project
The Lake Pleasant Regional Park Visitor Center is located on a terrace at the western end of New Waddell Dam.  It was constructed in 1990 by Reclamation as an overlook where visitors could observe construction of the new dam. Professionally designed exhibits featuring prehistoric and historic objects from Reclamation collections were installed inside including a large park map that showed points of interest using a push-button lighting system.
With the completion of New Waddell Dam in 1993, the visitor center has continued to provide an exceptional opportunity for visitors to be introduced to the diverse resources of the Park.  In the ensuing years, Park staff has added a wide variety of material to complement and enhance the original exhibits. These include brochures and promotional literature, additional exhibits, found objects, live animals, and growing inventory of snacks, beverages, and gift items for sale.  These diverse materials occupy every available space and then some, and offer little in the way of an organized, consistent educational presentation.
Twenty years later, the Visitor Center is greatly in need of refurbishment: upgrading and updating of the centers facilities, interpretive exhibits, and information services are urgent concerns.  The trend in visitation has been increasing over the years, and in 2009, the Visitor Center hosted nearly 45,000 guests (almost three-quarter of million people visited the Park) and netted over $41,000 in snack and souvenir sales. Visitation and sales are expected to continue to increase in coming years.
Sources should submit statements showing ability as a prime contactor (designer, constructor, or integrated firm) of an experienced and established design-build team including architectural/engineering, interior design, exhibit design, and construction services on similar commercial buildings of a retail/educational/ or recreational nature.
Should you be interested in this requirement, please submit a capability package to Meagan Fyffe at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than December 2, 2010, 3:00 PM PST.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above and the offeror's ability to meet the qualification requirements with this type of work.   It should also describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, and represent whether it is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern, DUNS number and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in terms of developing the appropriate procurement strategy for this acquisition.  
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Meagan Fyffe/LC-10100, Contracting Officer, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail mfyffe@usbr.gov.  
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is partnering with the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office (FCHCO), established by section 2602 of the Affordable Care Act, to evaluate models (as described in Section 3021(b)(2)(B)(x) &amp; (xi)) that: 1) fully integrate care for dual eligible individuals, 2) provide the management of all funds with respect to such individuals, and 3) develop models that allow states to test and evaluate systems of all-payer payment reform for the medical care of residents of the state. Section 3021 of the Affordable Care Act provides a framework that allows CMMI to design and evaluate such models pertaining to dual eligible individuals.
<p>Under the above ACA sections, CMS, through CMMI in concert with the FCHCO, will develop effective partnerships with states by providing them with the opportunity to enter into innovation contracts with CMS that shall result in integrated care models for dually eligible individuals.</p>
<p>The state innovation contracts for integrated care will be structured into two phases: (1) program/model design and (2) state implementation. The primary outcome of the program design contract will be a proposed state innovation demonstration model that describes how the state would structure, implement, and evaluate an intervention aimed at improving the quality, coordination, and cost-effectiveness of care received by individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, CMS may award up to 15 state program design contracts up to $1 million each. States that successfully complete the program design contract will be eligible to proceed to the implementation phase. The receipt of a program design contract does not guarantee support for the implementation phase, and; states will have to satisfy program design contract deliverables and meet all applicable conditions for CMS to exercise that option. The state implementation phase would include costs to prepare state infrastructure for conducting the model demonstration. These development and infrastructure costs may include systems change costs at the state-level for testing a new payment approach, development of a more efficient data exchange feed for near real-time tracking of claims, and additional resources necessary to ensure successful implementation of the model demonstration.</p>
<p>THIS SOLICITATION IS RESTRICTED TO THE STATES MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS ONLY.</p>

<DESC><br />*** This presolicitation is designed to give industry advanced notice of National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's intention to request proposals for the Center for Creative Learning Solutions in the near future. This notice does <strong>NOT</strong> require action or a response by offerors. The response date is simply the date in which this announcement will be archived by FedBizOps. ***<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement to evolve its learning architecture and learning delivery model within its Human Development (HD) Directorate, National Geospatial-Intelligence College (NGC). The NGC is migrating away from fully organically developed instructor-led learning solutions, to a learning architecture that enables not only core, highly structured learning solutions, but includes innovative and creative ways of meeting learners' needs through performance support, knowledge sharing and brokered opportunities. <br />
<p><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will cover NGA's requirements to support implementation of its Learning Architecture. Specifically, the services shall include the following: Program Management, Learning Integration, Learning Solutions, Academic Assessment, Technical Subject Matter Expertise consultation, Faculty Development, Registrar/Student Services and Other Direct costs. The Request for Proposal, number HM0177-11-R-0002 is estimated to be issued in&nbsp;December 2010. Contract award is estimated for May 2011.<br /><br /><br />The Center for Creative Learning Solutions (CCLS) procurement will be conducted under full and open competition with no set-aside. The government anticipates a single award contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods renewable annually, but not to exceed five years. The contract performance period is expected to commence on 01 June 2011. The contract will include Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) - Level of Effort CLIN and SubCLIN for Learning Integration and Learning Solutions; Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) - Performance Based CLINs for Faculty Development and Registration/Student Services; and a Cost Reimbursable CLIN for Other Direct Costs (ODCs). NGA expects to use Best Value - Trade Off evaluation methods and acquisition procedures as described in FAR Part 15. Contract award will be made to that offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government in terms of the evaluation factors listed in Section M of the RFP. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611710. <br /><br /><br />Any projected proposal due dates and times in this synopsis and any subsequent updates are estimates only; the actual proposal due date and time will be established in the final RFP. The RFP will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (https://www.fbo.gov). For information on how to register your company on FBO, to view or receive updates and notifications to the solicitation, please reference the FBO Vendor Guide located on the FBO web site home page. No paper copies of the solicitation will be furnished. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (www.ccr.gov), prior to award of a government contract; failure to register in the DOD Central Registration Database will render your firm ineligible for award. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award. The points of contact for this requirement are Cassandra Michael, 301-227-6601, Cassandra.L.Michael@nga.mil and Lora Mackin, 301-227-6933, Lora.L.Mackin@nga.mil.</p>

<DESC>To manage the overall vegetation (including, brush/slash, dead trees and understory as necessary) of designated areas in TA47 and TA48 to improve heavy, full spectrum, maneuver training accessibility and TADSS capability across the landscape. Woody species management will be accomplished by the maneuver lane thinning method or BCV habitat thinning method as described in the statement of work. All vegetation removal will either be cut or grubbed. Cut trees must not leave a stump height greater than two inches. Any ground disturbance that is deeper than three inches must be back filled.
<p>All cut/grubbed woody species (slash) and dead vegetation must be treated in one of the following ways: mulched, or stacked for burning, or removed from Ft. Hood. If mulched, pieces shall be two to four inches in width and length and the material should be spread over the landscape no thicker than a two inch layer unless mulch is used as a soil erosion BMP determined by NRCS Contracting Officer Technical Representative. If stacked for burning, all materials will be piled in 8 ft. tall, 15 ft. wide and no longer than 70 ft. All brush piles will be at least 150 ft from any identified endangered species (ES) habitat and no less than 300 ft from the installation boundary. Contractor may post and stay Ashe Juniper trees on site and may cut fire wood from Mesquite or hardwoods, except Red Oak, on site. All limbs that are cut from selected standing trees, including incidental wounds to trees, will be sealed by treating with paint or tree wound dressing spray. If any equipment is used on a diseased tree, living or dead, (as determined by NRCS personnel) the equipment must be sterilized by soaking equipment in a 20% bleach solution for at least 5 minutes and rinse with clean water before the equipment can be used on another living tree. Work will not be conducted in any DPW-NR identified ES habitat areas during nesting season. For all other birds protected by MBTA, 50% of the TA can be worked during nesting season per DPW Environmental guidelines. Period of performance for this project will be from January 24, 2011 through December 9, 2011.<br /><br />There will be a mandatory site visit for this requirement at 0900, 02 Dec 2010.&nbsp; No bids will be accepted from an entity which was not represented at the site visit.<br /><br />The Solicitation Document, Statement of Work, Terms and Conditions, and a Wage Determination have been attached and may be downloaded from this site.</p>

Semi Ruggedized Laptops 
The Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (ORIA/R&IE) in conjunction and collaboration with the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Washington D.C., and Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (ORIA\NAREL) is continuing its effort to provide defensible radiological analytical values to the Public and other Governmental Agencies. R&IE supports Superfund projects in cleanup, removal, remediation, and radiological emergencies. 
EPA under the National Response Plan (NRP) and other federally mandated regulations would be tasked as the Lead Federal Agency (LFA) for specific radiological emergency responses. 
These tasks include but not limited to supplying support equipment, personnel, and radiation detection equipment to EPA Regional personnel and Incident Command Leadership across the North America including Alaska. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION FOR PANASONIC LAPTOPS COMPUTERS:  The purpose of these laptops is to facilitate the Radiation Emergency Response Team's primary and support staff with mobility, connectivity, readiness and easy access to their specialized applications and data resources whether they are at work, travel or responding to an emergency in the field.  It will assist with the consolidation of imperative data that can be readily accessed in an efficient and quickly manner The Panasonic is semi ruggedized with aluminum cases providing additional protection against vibration and shock.   This is the same spec as many regions and the other EPA special teams have purchased for On Scene Coordinator (OSC), ER members etc. A total of 15 semi-ruggedized laptops will be purchased for RERT operations.  Each will be designed and setup similar for consistency in operation. Laptops will be setup at the R&IE facility with identical software, networking functions, cabling, and biometrical passwords features.  The laptops will be designed for semi-rugged handling, network capability and troubleshoot the data-logger on the RadNet-DNRMS, SCRIBE, RERT and regular office applications. On board serial port availability is a must in order to connect radiation detection and air monitoring systems. Additionally, the laptops will serve as desktop replacements.  Users will have traditional monitors and keyboards at their workstations to which the laptops will be docked for regular office network access.  
Semi-ruggedized computers will be utilized as office desktops as well as in field operations laptops. For this type of operation, we may be located in areas that require the handling of the laptop on vehicle hoods, off the back end of a trucks tailgate, or a rock out cropping. All of these areas make the laptop vulnerable to falling to the ground. To support such operation a semi-ruggedized laptop to meet RERT specification is ideal.  We need the flexibility to perform emergency repairs and or replacement in the field due to time constraints. These time constraints are driven by an emergency response situation where down time is not a luxury. We need a computer to perform exceptionally well under the harsh mobile environment and are easily upgradeable for future operations.

<DESC>The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T) are soliciting proposal abstracts for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles. Solicitation Number: N68335-09-R-0204 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Topics include development of new Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Advanced Aircraft Power Systems, Fuel Technology, and Aircraft Energy Conservation and Environmental Compliance. Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication "Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Years 2010 &amp;2011". The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at: www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored. Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 562-3, Code 2.5.2.3.1, Attn: Judith Dastis, Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 30 April 2010 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal. One original and three copies of each WP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted. WPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 562-3, Code 2.5.2.3.1, Attn: Judith Dastis, Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regard to this requirement. The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small business, Women-Owned Small Business and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.
