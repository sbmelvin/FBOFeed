<p>The Contractor shall conduct, research, development, testing and analysis</p>
<p>The Contractor shall evaluate vulnerabilities of bridges to single or multiple hazards</p>
<p>This requirement includes assessing the vulnerability of bridges to single or multiple hazards. Some engineering problems are multi-hazard in nature, such as unknown foundation research, which includes vulnerabilities to hydraulic scour as well as seismic, overload, impact/explosion concerns. Other research topics may concentrate on a single hazard, such as research on bridge scour.</p>
<p>The following lists examples of the type of work related to this task. The list is not all inclusive:</p>
<p>&bull; Foundation Characterization - characterization of bridge foundations for unknown geometry, integrity, and load carrying capacity. Load evaluation is often required for heavier truck use of the highway infrastructure as well as bridge replacement projects involving foundation reuse. <br /><br />&bull; Hydraulics Vulnerability - determination of the unknown foundation depth (pile-tip elevation) of existing bridges over waterways that cannot be evaluated for scour. Assess the hydraulic vulnerability of bridges to hydrodynamic forces.</p>
<p>&bull; Seismic and Other Extreme Event Vulnerability - Foundation integrity in an event of earthquake can trigger geotechnical hazards such as liquefaction and settlement, slope failure, and surface fault rupture.<br />&bull; Seismically induced earth pressure for Load &amp; Resistant Factor Design (LRFD) of earth retaining structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Site specific evaluation of earth ground motions.</p>
<p>&bull; Bridge vulnerability due to blast and other intentional high impact loadings.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop hazard mitigation and adaptation countermeasures for existing and new structures that includes a national data archive resource that captures experimental data as well as field reconnaissance data.</p>
<p>The following lists examples of the type of work related to this task. The list is not all inclusive:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of countermeasures for coastal hazards for inland and coastal bridges.</p>
<p>&bull; Development and deployment of high-performance, long-life, smart hydraulic hazard countermeasure materials that increase resiliency and reduce maintenance and reconstruction needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of scour countermeasures for shallow foundations.</p>
<p>&bull; Development and/or refinement of seismic design and mitigation measures for earthquake loadings.<br /><br />&bull; Development and deployment of aerodynamic design features and details that optimize the aerodynamic performance of new bridge designs.</p>
<p>&bull; Development and/or evaluation of retrofit techniques for effective mitigation of wind related performance problems with existing highway structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of methods and procedures for mitigation of wind related problems of structural safety and stability during construction of highway structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Development and optimization of countermeasures to mitigate blast loadings.</p>
<p>&bull; Optimization of countermeasures for mitigation of multiple hazards.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of hydrodynamic bridge systems to address flooding, overtopping, scour, surge and wave action.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of retrofits and designs that facilitate fish and wildlife passage through hydraulic structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of database to archive test data.<br />The Contractor shall research and develop the next generation of analysis and design tools to improve design reliability to achieve intended performance and service life:</p>
<p>The following lists examples of the type of work related to this task. The list is not all inclusive:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of enhanced analytical and modeling capabilities (high performance computing) for predicting hydraulic hazard effects and for assessing &amp; screening countermeasures.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of enhanced analytical and computational modeling capabilities (high performance computing tools) for evaluating and optimizing the aerodynamic performance of new structural designs.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of new physical modeling capabilities (wind tunnel testing) to simulate and evaluate fluid/structural interaction (wind/structural interaction).</p>
<p>&bull; Development of numerical models and tools for prediction of wind buffeting loads, galloping and vortex-induced vibration amplitudes, and onset velocities for flutter instability.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of design methodology taking into account of bridge redundancy/alternate load path as a hazard mitigation strategy for complex structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of design guidance for considering dynamic interaction of axial, shear and flexure in structural columns under seismic, blast and impact loadings.</p>
<p>&bull; Improvement in load prediction for heavy vehicle impact events and blast pressure definition from explosion on bridge structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of performance based seismic design criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of enhanced scour analysis capabilities for inland and coastal bridges.<br />Development of enhanced analytical and computational modeling capabilities (high performance computing tools) for evaluating and optimizing blast performance of existing and new bridge systems.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform post-event assessment of highway structures. <br /><br />This subtask includes the support for post hazard assessment teams and the development of protocols and standards for the rapid assessment and forensic investigation of highway infrastructures after an extreme event. The emphasis shall be on the structural evaluation after widespread natural disasters including hydraulic (flooding, hurricane, tsunami, typhoon, ice flow), seismic (earthquake), and aerodynamic (hurricane, tornado, and other wind events) which typically impact a large corridor. Therefore, this may necessitate the use of wide-area remote sensing technologies. The scope of this multi-disciplinary subtask also includes other hazards-such as blasts, ice flow, landslides, collisions and fires-which typically impact few bridges rather than at a larger network of highway infrastructure.<br /><br />The following lists examples of the type of work related to this task. The list is not all inclusive:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of rapid deployment sensing systems to capture hydraulic parameters during and after storm events.</p>
<p>&bull; Network-Level Evaluation and Screening - This subtask requires the performance and leveraging of field reconnaissance surveys from multiple sensor platforms including: 1) satellite remote sensing, 2) airborne aerial surveys; 3) ground-based sensor networks; and, 4) structural sensing and diagnostics.<br /><br />&bull; Bridge-Level Assessment of Damage - Develop rapid evaluation techniques/ tools for bridge and tunnels safety assessment immediately after an extreme event. The techniques are needed especially after a highway structure suffers damage-but not yet collapsed or severely damaged as determined by visual inspection. Procedures and guidance must be established for effective team deployment, inspection, documentation, infrastructure damage assessment, as well as collection and organization of data.</p>
<p>&bull; Field Support System - The support assistance includes preparation, response, and mitigation efforts for FHWA or State DOT's concerning damage to highways and bridges. The post-event response and support could include assembling and deploying a team of experienced engineers and scientists to the area of impact as soon as practical for the related purposes of road and bridge damage mechanism assessment and recovery decision support. Such immediate assessment can lead to the collection of valuable, time-sensitive, data and information which may be destroyed during recovery efforts. The activity shall also provide FHWA with post-event assessments, recommendations, and reports.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of robust and rapid deployment sensors and/or sensing systems to capture wind conditions and structural behavior just prior to, during, and after major storm events. Development of strategies, system specifications, and data requirements for long term monitoring and evaluation of structures subject to infrequent, but extreme, wind events or conditions.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop and deploy new tests and methods to more accurately and efficiently characterize materials.</p>
<p>The following lists examples of the type of work related to this task. The list is not all inclusive:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of advanced materials such as nano and self-healing materials in bridge systems as countermeasures for mitigating blast, impact and seismic hazards.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of design criteria for innovative designs, materials and construction for seismic applications.</p>

<DESC>Thrift Savings Plan Service Center<br />Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board
<p>Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>1. General</p>
<p>The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Agency or FRTIB) is using this RFI to gather information from industry in order to better understand current industry ap-proaches in managing and operating consolidated Service Center Call and Processing Centers. Work is required to be performed in the continental U.S.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the FRTIB to contract whatsoever. Further, the FRTIB is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the FRTIB will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Any information that the respondent considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. All submissions become Agency property and will not be returned, including any proprietary information</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>The FRTIB is an independent Federal agency in the Executive Branch created by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA). The TSP is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal civilian employees and members of the uni-formed services that offers its participants the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under I.R.C. &sect;401(k) plans. The mission of the FRTIB is to administer the TSP solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) informs the Agency's procurement activities; however, as a non-appropriated fund Agency, it is not bound by the FAR.</p>
<p>The TSP is the largest participant-directed defined contribution plan in the world. As of August 2013, the TSP had approximately 4.6 million participants, of which an estimated 4% are domiciled overseas, and about $367 billion in assets. The TSP is available only to Federal employees of the civilian service and members of the uniformed services; vested participants may leave their funds in the TSP after they leave service.</p>
<p>The FRTIB currently has two contractor operated call centers handling all inbound calls, outbound survey/follow-up work, and written/electronic mail processing. One of these (in Clintwood, VA) is government owned, and the other (in Frostburg, MD) is contractor owned. The FRTIB also has one contractor owned/contractor operated processing center in Birmingham, AL, designed to provide back office support functions (mail opening, scanning, data entry and forms processing) for the TSP. All centers are required to be physically located in the U.S., and all call center staff must be U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The agents, designated as Participant Service Representatives (PSRs) respond to in-coming calls from participants, beneficiaries, and other third parties that concern (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>&bull; Account Maintenance<br />&bull; Loan Issuances and Repayments<br />&bull; Withdrawal Information<br />&bull; Service Requests (e.g., transaction processing, fulfillment inquiries)</p>
<p>All desktop applications are government provided. Mail opening and scanning equip-ment is also government provided. Phone equipment is government provided at one site and contractor provided at the other call center.</p>
<p>Annually the two call centers receive approximately 3.4 million calls with an opt-out rate of 70% (approximately 2.5 million calls), 50,000 pieces of written correspondence, and 50,000 electronic mail inquiries. The processing center receives approximately 1.1 million forms annually for processing, 70% of which are received via fax.</p>
<p>The TSP's vision for the future includes enhancing the participant experience. This includes, but is not restricted to, making our call centers more consultative, offering participants TSP education and guidance based on their individual needs; initiating outbound calling programs to assist participants with forms/transaction processing; rapid turnaround of forms processing and drastically reducing and potentially eliminating paper based transactions by moving to fully electronic, but secure submissions.</p>
<p><br />3. RFI Questions</p>
<p>To aid the Agency in understanding current industry approaches in managing and operating consolidated call and processing centers, FRTIB requests responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What structural strategy would you recommend in operating call and processing centers that perform, mail opening, scanning, data entry, forms processing, in-bound phone services, outbound call programs, e-messaging (secure e-mail) and correspondence processing?</p>
<p>2. Given the configuration you recommend, what considerations are there from a site location perspective? In providing your responses please include a risk as-sessment for each approach.</p>
<p>3. Given the approximate size of the operation as outlined above, what do you be-lieve is the optimum number of sites and why?</p>
<p>4. What do you suggest are optimal operating hours to perform and offer these ser-vices? Please give suggestions for hours of operations and coverage.</p>
<p>5. If you suggest more than one location, should all work functions be done at all locations, or should some only be completed at one site?</p>
<p>6. Based on your configurations and locations, how would you prepare for and handle disaster recovery?</p>
<p>7. Should processing staff be cross-trained on both inbound and back office pro-cessing functions? Please provide reasons for your recommendation.</p>
<p>8. Do you have an outbound calling program? If so, are staff cross-trained to han-dle both inbound and outbound functions? Are outbound programs educational or sales related? What metrics should be used for qualitative calls?</p>
<p>9. How does your staffing configuration relate to employee retention? Do you pro-vide employee incentives? If so, what effect does this have on turnover?</p>
<p>10. What contract strategy and type should be used for this requirement and why?</p>
<p>11. What should the duration of the contract be and what is your rationale?</p>
<p>12. What metrics should be used to measure contractor performance? Should in-centives be used to oversee metric performance? If so, how should they be structured?</p>
<p>13. What future trends do you see occurring in the call and processing center industry?</p>
<p>14. What experience does your firm have in running combined processing and call center functions? Please describe these projects, the industries served, the amount of staff required for each one, how you structured them, and how you used your resources to balance inbound call handling with back office functions. Please note if you used subcontractors in any of these projects.</p>
<p>15. Explain the phase in and out approaches and transition time needed until the new centers would be fully operational.</p>
<p>16. What would be the best structural approach for a Government consolidated call and processing center operation that replicates some of the for profit financial services characteristics associated with enhancing participants' experience? In particular, fostering a strong educational environment consisting of consultative conversations, outbound calling programs, more immediate responses, and feedback touch points to provide a robust customer service model.</p>
<p>17. Identify best practices that should be applied to current and future call centers and processing centers.</p>
<p><br />4. Submission</p>
<p>Your submission should include:</p>
<p>1. A cover letter, to include name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if differ-ent from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact(s).</p>
<p>2. Submit your responses to this RFI within thirty (30) days from issuance to Timothy.Costas@TSP.Gov. Phone: (202) 942-1689</p>

<DESC>This notification is for market research purposes only to identify potential contractors who have the tooling, skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This effort is to manufacture Initial Spare Parts for the Enhanced Wing Assembly (EWA). Contractor will manufacture and supply spare parts to the Air Force supply chain so they will be available to support EWA unique requirements.</p>
<p>QUALIFICATION STATEMENT:</p>
<p>The Air Force requires EWA unique parts to support initial flying operations and testing of the new wing prior to provisioning efforts being completed and implemented. Therefore, this acquisition will be a contract to assure the short-term supportability of the EWA. Requirements for producing EWA parts include the demonstrated capability to manufacture according to 3D modeling information including tight tolerances. This 3D data is still in development and will be provided with short lead times requiring maximum flexibility in producing parts. Contractors will be required to demonstrate verification that 3D data imported to be used for manufacturing exactly matches organic source data. Contractors are also required to submit data demonstrating their ability to produce or utilize -- if they have available -- extensive tooling that is unique to the EWA assembly to assure proper end products and mating points/surfaces. They must also demonstrate the flexibility to change manufacturing processes should a design change necessitate it. This tooling is estimated to cost an initial investment of over $21M and 11 months to produce. Neither the tooling nor the data on how it was created will be available as GFE/GFI during the execution timeframe of this contract. The data must also verify the Contractor's capability to manufacture the parts and qualify first articles early enough to still be able to deliver the parts within the contractual period of performance. Contractors would also need to demonstrate their ability to deliver parts on a compressed time frame should demand necessitate it. The Contractor will be required to verify capabilities to manage component inventories, develop manufacturing testing (or demonstrate it if in place), and manufacture and test aerospace ready-for-use subassemblies with existing quality processes suitable for military aerospace applications.</p>
<p>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The Air Force's planned methodology will be a single purchase supply contract to procure initial spares with an anticipated Firm-Fixed-Price arrangement.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>&bull;Approximately 74 initial spare parts of varying quantities (approximately 170 total parts) to establish the pipeline of EWA unique spare parts.</p>
<p>&bull;The effort to produce initial spares has an estimated value of $2.8M with an estimated period of performance from Apr 2014 through Sep 2015.</p>
<p>&bull;The Contractor shall establish, implement, and maintain an Initial Spares Program in accordance with the listing of parts</p>
<p>&bull;When the prime contractor buys end articles or a portion thereof from a vendor/subcontractor, the prime contractor shall impose these specifications upon its vendors/subcontractors. The inclusion of the requirements on contractor's subcontracts/purchase orders to its vendor/subcontractors does not relieve the prime contractor of its obligation to insure timely delivery of the required deliverables.</p>

<DESC>Reference Number 13-114. The US Air Force Defense Support Program (DSP) intends to issue a follow-on contract to the current DSP On-orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC) to provide factory and operations site(s) support and sustainment to the on-orbit DSP satellite constellation. The new contract, DSP Sustainment Contract (DSC) is currently envisioned by the government to be awarded as a single contract. It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released in the first quarter of FY14 with a period of performance beginning in FY 15 with one basic year and four (4) one-year options. Contract award is projected for the 4th quarter of FY14. The DSP mission uses highly technical non-imaging infrared and other sensors to detect ballistic missile launches, space launches, endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear detonations, and reports them to US and allied forces and assets deployed worldwide through the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment (ITWAA) configuration control processes. The DSC will require the following support: (1) Technical support to operational missile warning on-orbit constellation satellites, trending analysis, performance and data archive, as well as the training of new personnel; (2) Space based non-imaging infrared mission performance assessment for real-time mission support and infrared event data analysis; (3) Operational satellite and payload anomaly support to include root cause determination and implementation of corrective actions; (4) Contractor facility supporting on-orbit operations (either from the factory or at the ops site) must be Defense Security Service (DSS) certified and capable of processing classified information as required by the DSP constellation. The contractor retains responsibility for recapitalization and/or replacement of any hardware/equipment obsolescence throughout the duration of the contract; (5) Program support includes management of contractor team and contract/business operations segment to track financial issues and deliverables; (6) Capability to develop software tools and implement command plans; and (7) Support at various government sites. In addition, the government may seek to continue efforts currently on the DOSSC as follows: (1) rapid prototyping of data processing enhancements that maximize the utility of DSP data and maintain mission capability of aging assets; and (2) mission processor initiatives. Interested parties must possess knowledgeable, capable, and experienced individuals with the proper security clearances who can provide real time assistance/guidance to government satellite operators at the Mission Control Station and any backup site supporting operations.

Purpose:<br /><br /></strong>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Aegis Ashore (AA) Program is conducting market research to determine interest, cost, and capability to manufacture Array Frame and Weldment Assemblies to be fabricated at a contractor location and shipped to a location to be determined within the continental United States at a later date. This market research will provide information to: 1) identify potential sources and their experience base to fulfill the requirements; 2) support the development of acquisition requirements, strategies, and cost estimates; 3) identify barriers to competition to reduce competition risk; 4) determine the need for documentation necessary to support proposal preparation; and 5) provide information on the capabilities of small business to fulfill the requirements in order to assess the feasibility of a total Small Business set-aside. The contemplated contract type is Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The resultant knowledge aids MDA in determining the best acquisition strategy to fulfill this requirement.<br /><br />This is a market research announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor shall it be construed as a commitment by MDA. Information submitted will be considered an exchange of capabilities. Any proprietary information provided should be properly marked and MDA will control it as such.

Background:</strong> <br /><br />The AA Program was established on September 17, 2009 in response to the direction of the President of the United States. As part of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), AA builds upon already deployed U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) assets and adapts a sea-based weapon system for use on land. This will be accomplished by adapting the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and Vertical Launching System (VLS) to the land based concept. The AA Missile Defense System (AAMDS) provides the capability to detect, track, intercept, and destroy missiles.<br /><br />The AA Program Office is developing an acquisition strategy to deploy the AAMDS at a designated Poland Site in Calendar Year 2019. The Array Frame and Weldment fabrication efforts required under this acquisition have been considered in relation to the requirements and milestones of the AA Program to establish realistic deadlines and deliverables, while balancing the AA funding profiles. The AA program's evaluation of the Array Frame acquisition strategy alternatives will be accomplished in multiple stages, with this first Request for Information (RFI) Sources Sought provided as an invitation for interested parties to provide input and information on their capabilities.<br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />3.

<DESC>Request for Information
Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy
Action Planning System


This is a request for information (RFI) being issued for market research purposes.  The objectives of this RFI are (1) to identify potential commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions; and (2) to obtain a rough order of magnitude for the cost and time estimated to implement such at the Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy (VAAA), Frederick, MD.  COTS solutions may need to be customized to better fit the needs of the VAAA. 
Background:
The VAAA was created to address the growing acquisition workforce challenge facing the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Federal Government overall.  To more effectively support the VAAA mission, we want to foster learning and influence behavior both inside and beyond the classroom through a platform that provides project management (PM) students an opportunity to apply the skills they learn in the classroom to real world projects. 
 As part of VAAA's vision of providing a highly performance-based training environment, the need for a state-of-the-art Action Planning (AP) system has been identified.  The system currently in use has served its most basic purpose well; that is, it provides a means for PM students to create and manage action plans for their selected projects to fulfill their Federal Acquisition Certification in Program/Project Management (FAC-P/PM) certification requirements.  Essentially, students are required to access the system and build their action plan, along with its associated tasks, risks and mitigation, benefits of completing the action, timelines, and percentages of completion for each task.  However, a more robust tool is needed that will utilize industry's most current best practices, and exceed the capabilities of the tool currently in use.  The users of this action planning system will include participants and teams in the VAAA PM School courses, their instructors, supervisors, and leadership.

Please provide a summary of responses for each of the requirements listed below.  Provide a description for the cost structure and ranges of costs, and include a breakdown of costs to include customization of the system, training (if any), train the trainer, etc.  Also include your company's socio-economic category and any government-wide contract vehicles or VA contract vehicles you or a partner hold.
Business Requirements:
"	Action planning functionality: The system must provide PM functionality that allows individuals to create and manage an AP.  Individuals need to be able to access the system through the internet.  Functionality may be further defined by specific roles, including the following:
o	Individual:  Individuals will be able to enter their baseline action plan for a selected project, to include all associated tasks and their percentages of completion, barriers and mitigation, benefits gained by completing tasks, resources, success indicators/output, monitor action plan compliance, and request action plan closeouts.  They will also be able to manage and implement updates to the plan as required. 
o	Team:  For the duration of their class and when working on real world projects, team members will have access to the action planning system, and be able to share their action planning ideas, and collaborate on team project action plans.
o	Supervisor:  Supervisors will have access to employees' action plans as further described in the "Collaboration" bullet below.
o	Instructor:  The instructor will also have access to participants' action plans, as further described in "Collaboration" bullet below.
"	Easy to navigate user interface:  Individuals, their supervisors, instructors, and VAAA staff must be able to navigate the system with ease.  The system should not require extensive training and should be as intuitive as possible.  Additionally, the system should be easily configurable; that is, there should be flexibility in updating and revising the tool to meet changing requirements.  
"	Role-based system: Individuals need to be able to access only their own action planning information and have the ability to populate this information themselves. It is anticipated that the following user roles will be required: project management (PM) course participants, their supervisors, instructors, coaches and mentors, and VAAA staff.  Supervisors and VAAA staff will need to have more global access to the participants' information and action plans.
"	Collaboration: The system must be collaborative in both the learning environment and real-world operational environment. That is, individuals, their teams, supervisors, and instructors need to have the ability to collaborate during and after the learning experience, in order to reinforce and enhance knowledge gained.  This same collaboration will be available in the working environment, but without the instructor (in this case, a coach or mentor may enter the collaborative environment).  The system should allow those with different roles to have the ability to work on and access the same Action Plan, as in the case with the Team Action plan referenced above in the 'Action Planning Functionality' bullet. Ability for participants to participate in coaching/mentoring, in order to further enhance the more formal classroom learning experience.
"	Interoperability with other systems: The system must provide a manual exchange of data with other systems, or via Application Program Interoperability (API).
"	Customizable reporting: The system must provide a method for customizable reporting (e.g., monthly and quarterly action plan reporting of baseline information, interview and implementation plan information).

<DESC>DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.<br />APS/HFD Request for Information
<p><br />Synopsis:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only. It is not a request for <br />proposal and does not constitute any obligation by the Government to award a contract based on the <br />findings of this RFI. The Government will not reimburse interested sources or respondents to this <br />notice, for any costs incurred in association with this announcement or for subsequent exchanges of <br />information.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Warren (ACC-WRN) is seeking sources on behalf of Program <br />Management Office Ground Combat Vehicle, Product Manager Requirements, Management and Analysis for <br />an integrated Active Protection System (APS) and Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) system. The intent of <br />this market research is to identify potential sources for development of a combined Active <br />Protection System and Hostile Fire Detection system capability that could potentially be applied to <br />tactical and combat ground vehicles.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information about a combined APS and HFD capability that includes <br />Soft-Kill (electronic countermeasures) and Hard-Kill defeat mechanisms, the ability to detect enemy <br />optics prior to the hostile fire event (referred to as pre-shot), and the ability to identify the <br />point of origin (POO) of the hostile fire event. The APS and HFD capabilities must be able to <br />operate while the platform is on-the-move (OTM) and perform their respective functions in an <br />operationally useful timeframe.</p>
<p>The HFD capability must be, at a minimum, able to identify the azimuth and elevation to the <br />location of the hostile fire event. Ideally, the system would provide the range and<br />geo-location (e.g. latitude and longitude or 10 digit grid coordinate) of the hostile-fire event.</p>
<p><br />A low false alarm rate is important to the overall effectiveness of an APS and HFD capability. <br />Technical approaches to minimizing the false alarm rate, as well as any supporting analyses or data <br />to quantitatively verify false alarm performance, should be provided.</p>
<p><br />The Government is interested in integrated, system-level approaches that could be ready for a <br />minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5/6 demonstration in Fiscal Year 2015. An explanation of <br />component and system maturity is required; if TRL levels<br />are used, provide detailed reasoning for choosing the listed level.</p>
<p>Sources possessing potential solutions are invited to submit a white paper not to exceed 15 pages <br />in length describing their capabilities and system concepts. The white paper must include, at a <br />minimum, comprehensive descriptions of the system supported by facts and rigorous scientific <br />reasoning that address the following considerations for<br />all technologies proposed: a detailed discussion of potential sensor, countermeasure, and software <br />solutions, potential integrated system approaches, an estimation of system performance against <br />threats (please include the minimum threat launch range the APS can handle), amount of rolled <br />homogeneous armor (RHA) [in mm] required to prevent perforation of residual fragments, accuracy to <br />which the HFD capability can locate a hostile fire event, and maximum range the HFD capability can <br />detect a hostile fire event), a discussion of relevant experience with technologies for similar <br />applications, current technology maturity, and cost.</p>
<p><br />White Papers shall also include:</p>
<p><br />1. Point (s) of contact (email and phone numbers) for further Government inquiry should more <br />information be desired, name and address of firm, Central Contractor Registration CAGE Code and <br />current level of firm's facility clearance (Secret, Top Secret or No Clearance).</p>
<p><br />2. Statement as to whether or not your company is considered a small or large business. Please also <br />indicate any socioeconomic classification (8(a) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-Owned <br />Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Veteran-Owned Small Business,<br />Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business) that applies. The small business size standard is <br />500 employees for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712.</p>
<p>3. Respondents should provide the following information if the company has previously performed <br />this type of effort or a similar type effort (to include size and complexity): Contract Number, <br />Point of Contact (POC), e-mail address, phone number, and a brief description of your company's <br />direct support of the effort.</p>
<p>This information will help the Government form its acquisition strategy.</p>
<p><br />Proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI shall be marked accordingly and will be <br />protected when clearly identified as proprietary.</p>
<p><br />The ideas presented in the white paper will be discussed and assessed by U.S. Army</p>
<p>Program Management Office Ground Combat Vehicle, Product Manager Requirements,<br />Management and Analysis. Government support contractors may be involved in the review and <br />assessment of responses submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p><br />Response to this RFI should be received no later than 01 November 2013. Acknowledgement of receipt <br />will be issued. The subject of the email message shall be: APS/HPD RFI - Your Company's Name. <br />Responses should be submitted via email to<br />the following individual: Mr. Tom Scurlock (Thomas.A.Scurlock.civ@mail.mil)</p>
<p><br />DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition




1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, RLR VA Medical Center.  This is for PR 583-13-4-942-4413.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  The purchase of a prosthetic limb component  from a single source per medical determination of need.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   

1 Rheo Knee Part RKN120007 	1 EA
2 Propio foot #PRPR4 2 0		1 EA
3 Propio foot cover, Right #FCPEO	1 EA
4 Propio foot cover, Left #FCPEO	1 EA
 
Ossur Americas Inc, 27051 Towne Centre Drive, Foothill Ranch, CA 92610: 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X )    (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;   
	(  )  	  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2; 
	(  )     (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )     (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	( )   (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; see also 38 U.S.C. 8123
	(  )     (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )     (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The Rheo knee requested has been selected for its unique features which lend to its success with a certain group of amputee patients at the RLR VAMC facility. The specific determinations of a prosthetic limb are determined on a case by case basis, but there are certain criteria that determine whether or not the process will start with the Rheo knee and the Propio foot, or another type of prosthetic.  These items need to be stocked in advance to minimize wait time and to prevent the veteran from having to spend a lot of time on a temporary leg and then have to relearn the process with the final leg.  The factors and variables that determine the need for this type of prosthetic over another in the initial stages are extremely numerous, but the need for this exact leg and its composition, function and fit exist at the beginning of the clinical evaluation process for the group of patients the physician determines need this type of limb.  The Propio foot is designed to work with the Rheo knee and the combine other components with this knee voids the manufacturer's warranty and jeopardizes the manufacturer's certification that knee will preform as promised.  


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Market research was done based on clinical guidelines and the required characteristics of different types of legs for different classificaitons of amputees.  This was one of several selected.  Ongoing observation is being undertaken to watch for new products and improvements to existing ones by the Prosthetic staff.    

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:    

Internet research has found several prosthetic legs that range from 5,000.00 to 50,000.00 dollars, depending on features like material use to compose the limb and specific functions of the limb to help the patient accomplish walking, running, or other activities.  The price of this limb and its accessories is $27063.00 and falls well within the price range indicated by this research.  Based on this market research the CO determines this price to be fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:   Market research was done based on clinical guidelines and the required characteristics of different types of legs for different classifiations of amputees.  This was one of several selected.  Ongoing observation is being undertaken to watch for new products and improvements to existing ones by the prosthetic staff.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:   None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: none

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:   Based on the medical determination above, no further actions are contemplated.  


12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><div>Dear Industry Partner,&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is to advise the General Services Administration (GSA) Public Building Service (PBS) contractor community of PBS&rsquo;s plans regarding contract actions that may be necessary in the event contract funding is affected by a lapse in appropriations. &nbsp;</div>
<div>The budget for fiscal year 2014 has not been enacted and as a result there is a lapse in the funds designated to purchase certain supplies and services as well as reduction in the Government's capacity to administer GSA PBS contracts. As a consequence of the lapse, certain planned procurements may be cancelled and certain existing PBS contracts may be stopped, reduced in scope, terminated or partially terminated. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>Should GSA PBS determine that any of these actions is necessary, the Contracting Officer for each of the affected contracts will provide prompt appropriate notice to the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the affected contract. Notices will contain the direction necessary to comply. &nbsp;If a GSA PBS contract will not be affected by the lapse in appropriations, GSA PBS does not plan to provide any separate notifications or communications of that fact. Unless a GSA PBS contractor is provided a formal notification to the contrary, all GSA PBS contractors must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />For any inquires regarding GSA contracts being administered outside of PBS, please refer your inquiries to the GSA contracting officer. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for your continued partnership with GSA PBS..</div>

<p>SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />&bull; Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>

A firm must be willing to perform services required under both types of projects. The work includes site adaptation of USPS CADD-based standard plans for new facilities and expansions, design services for repair and alteration projects, preparation of contract documents, contract administration, commissioning, and inspection services. The contract will primarily cover postal facilities in Georgia, but it may also be used for projects in any state bordering Georgia. The contract will have a base term of two years and will have (3) one-year renewal options. The total contract amount over the five-year period cannot exceed $9,500,000. Individual work orders will be negotiated for each project. Work orders for any one project cannot exceed $500,000. Typical work orders range from $2,500 to $50,000. Firms that have the qualifications to perform the services described are invited to submit two copies of completed SF-330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications. SF-330 can be found at www.gsa.gov under the Forms Library. Firms must also submit a statement that addresses the following questions / items: (1) How long has the technical team been working together? Provide areas of expertise for each team member, and provide details on how the technical team will be structured and managed. Note: The technical team is defined as all architects, engineers, project managers, and construction administrators that will be directly assigned to support this contract (2) What experience does the team have in renovation projects? Provide information on specific projects. (3) What experience does the team have in historical preservation projects? Provide information on specific projects. (4) What experience does the team have in responding to emergencies (i.e. flooding, accidents resulting in structural damage, etc.)? Provide information on specific projects. (5) Provide typical office information on work hours, days of operation, emergency contact information, and evidence of current errors and omissions insurance of $200,000 per claim.
<p>All firms must be licensed to perform architect and engineering services in Georgia. Prime firms must have at least two licensed architects on staff who maintain licenses for Georgia. The prime firm, in conjunction with any consultants, must have at least one electrical engineer, one mechanical engineer, one structural engineer, and one civil engineer licensed in Georgia. Prime firms must be located in Georgia. This location requirement can be met in one of two ways: 1. The prime firm's sole office is in Georgia, or 2. The prime firm has one or more branch offices in Georgia that have been in operation for a minimum of one year and all the architectural design, coordination, and management of the projects will be performed in those offices. There is no restriction on the geographical location of consultants. Prime firms that plan to use resources from more than one of their offices in Georgia must indicate on their SF-330 the staffing compositions of each of those offices.</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated on the content of their SF-330 and the responses to the questions / items above. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, contracts may be awarded to more than one A/E firm, and contracts may be used in neighboring states. The successful firms' compliance with licensure requirements in neighboring states will be checked prior to receiving any work in those states. Participation of minority-owned and woman-owned businesses in U.S. Postal Service architect-engineer selections is encouraged but is not an evaluation factor. It is prohibited to pay any fee, commission, percentage, or brokerage fee to any person or firm contingent upon or resulting from award of a contract for this project. Submissions will not be retained or returned. This is not a request for proposal. Submit the required documentation to USPS Eastern Facilities Construction CMT, Attn: Georgia A/E Selection, PO Box 27497, Greensboro, NC 27498-1103 or 7029 Albert Pick Rd, Ste 300, Greensboro, NC 27409-9521.</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP- P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.</p>

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.



3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	The C&A requirements do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
h.	   Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
(1)	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2)	VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3)	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

(a)	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
(b)	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre- approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) Date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
 (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:


(1)	Notification;
(2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 
3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3)	Data breach analysis;
(4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and 
credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6)	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit 
records, histories, or financial affairs.

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to
evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

9. TRAINING
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
(1)	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
(2)	Successfully complete the "VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior FY12 - Print" training and annually complete required security training. The training is accessible on 
https://www.tms.va.gov/plateau/user/login.jsp
(3)	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

CONTRACTOR RULES OF BEHAVIOR
This User Agreement contains rights and authorizations regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This User Agreement covers my access to all VA data whether electronic or hard copy ("Data"), VA information systems and resources ("Systems"), and VA sites ("Sites"). This User Agreement incorporates Rules of Behavior for using VA, and other information systems and resources under the contract.
1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONTRACT:
a.	I understand and agree that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in accessing or using any VA, or other Federal Government information systems.
b.	I consent to reviews and actions by the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) staff designated and authorized by the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and to the VA OIG regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. These actions may include monitoring, recording, copying, inspecting, restricting access, blocking, tracking, and disclosing to all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel as directed by the VA CIO without my prior consent or notification.
c.	I consent to reviews and actions by authorized VA systems administrators and Information Security Officers solely for protection of the VA infrastructure, including, but not limited to monitoring, recording, auditing, inspecting, investigating, restricting access, blocking, tracking, disclosing to authorized personnel, or any other authorized actions by all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel.
d.	I understand and accept that unauthorized attempts or acts to access, upload, change, or delete information on Federal Government systems; modify Federal government systems; deny access to Federal government systems; accrue resources for unauthorized use on Federal government systems; or otherwise misuse Federal government systems or resources are prohibited.
e.	I understand that such unauthorized attempts or acts are subject to action that may result in criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. This includes penalties for violations of Federal laws including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) and 18 U.S.C. 2701 (unlawful access to stored communications).
 
f.	I agree that OI&T staff, in the course of obtaining access to information or systems on my behalf for performance under the contract, may provide information about me including, but not limited to, appropriate unique personal identifiers such as date of birth and social security number to other system administrators, Information Security Officers (ISOs), or other authorized staff without further notifying me or obtaining additional written or verbal permission from me.
g.	I understand I must comply with VA's security and data privacy directives and handbooks. I understand that copies of those directives and handbooks can be obtained from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COTR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
h.	I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COTR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.
2. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR
a.	Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.
b.	The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
(1)	Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
(2)	Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
(3)	I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract. If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
(4)	Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
(5)	Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COTR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not
 
confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
(6)	Contractors' use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
(7)	Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
(8)	Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
(9)	Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.
(10)	Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
(11)	Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders.
(12)	Ensure that the COTR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
(13)	Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COTR.
(14)	Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COTR.
 
(15)	Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
(16)	Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COTR.
(17)	Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
(18)	Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.
3. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES
a.	When required to complete work under the contract, I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible. If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA approved remote access software and services.
b.	Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.
c.	I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COTR.
d.	I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.
4. STATEMENT ON LITIGATION
This User Agreement does not and should not be relied upon to create any other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law, by a party to litigation with the United States Government.
 












5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
I acknowledge receipt of this User Agreement. I understand and accept all terms and conditions of this User Agreement, and I will comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement and any additional VA warning banners, directives, handbooks, notices, or directions regarding access to or use of information systems or information. The terms and conditions of this document do not supersede the terms and conditions of the signatory's employer and VA.

<DESC><br /><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />KOAIN4RI306<br />CONTINUED MAINTENANCE FOR PITNEY BOWES<br />Account # 2010-9742-86-4 <br />REFERENCES<br />&bull; In accordance with FAR 6.001 (a), full J&amp;A documentation is not required for contracts awarded using simplified acquisition procedures of FAR 13 (except commercial items under FAR 13.5 &gt; $100,000)
<p>&bull; FAR 13.106 (b) states that, "The contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, or industrial mobilization). The following documentation constitutes the rationale for this decision.</p>
<p>DOCUMENTATION:<br />1. Requiring Activity: DFAS-INDIANAPOLIS<br />2. Supplies or services being procured:</p>
<p>Maintenance agreement is for existing equipment that includes: one (1) Pitney Bowes DM800 and one (1) Pitney Bowes DM1000 mailing systems. All parts (except consumables) and labor are included.</p>
<p>1. Postage Meter Rental, Low-Cost PSD, Model 1M00 SN: 4220675 Bill 4 Qtrs</p>
<p>2. Maintenance Agreement Intellilink DM8001, Model 1D00, SN: 0079970 Bill 4 Qtrs<br /><br />3. Maintenance Agreement Softguard Generic, Model SF80, SN: 0079970 Bill Semi-annual<br /><br />4.

<p>9. Postage Meter Rental, low-Cost PSD, Model 1M00, SN: 4244718 Bill 4 Qtrs</p>
<p>10. Maintenance Agreement DM1000 WOW, Model DW00, SN: 3303070 Bill Semi-annual</p>
<p>11. Maintenance Agreement Softguard, Model SF00, SN: 0121687 Bill Semi-annual</p>
<p>12. Maintenance Agreement Intellilink DM8001, Model 1D00, SN: 0121687 Bill 4 Qtrs</p>
<p>13. Maintenance Agreement 70/150 Scale, Model MP49, SN: 0021521 Bill Semi-annual<br />3. Reason that this is a sole source procurement (i.e., proposed contractor's unique qualifications, etc.): The existing equipment is several years old and a maintenance agreement is necessary to prevent a work stoppage. The equipment should be serviced by the manufacturing company in order to ensure there is no degradation of service. Agreement shall include training, maintenance, parts, labor, emergency repair (24 hour response time) and services. Pitney Bowes guarantees product performance as long as we continually maintain coverage with Pitney Bowes equipment maintenance agreement / software agreement after warranty. If equipment cannot be repaired to a satisfactory operating condition within a reasonable time, Pitney Bowes shall provide a loaner at no additional cost. Replacement equipment will be provided within 24 hours.<br />4. Technical requirements personnel certification<br />I hereby certify that this justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully complete this requirement. I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advanced planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.</p>

<p>REFERENCES:<br />&bull; FAR 13.106 (b) states that, "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization). The following documentation constitutes the rationale for this decision</p>
<p>DOCUMENTATION:</p>
<p>(1) Requiring Activity:</p>
<p>a. Requesting Activity <br />DFAS-I&amp;T Infrastructure and Production Support <br />David Banton <br />8899 East 56th Street <br />Indianapolis, IN 46249 <br />(317) 212-5649</p>

<p>(3) Reason that this is a brand name procurement (i.e., proposed contractor's unique qualifications, etc.):<br />Per DoDI 8100.3, all telephony including facsimile products (among other specific areas) connecting to the DSN must be on the DoD Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC) Approved Products List (APL) (https://aplits.disa.mil). Also, DISA will not issue an authority to connect (ATC) - turning on DSN telephony services - until sufficient documentation has been submitted showing the configuration and use of an approved JITC solution. The only facsimile solution approved at this time is OpenText RightFax. OpenText RightFax products, support, and maintenance are available from authorized resellers of OpenText RightFax. DFAS is renewing licenses and purchasing maintenance for the OpenText RightFax software currently loaded on DFAS systems. RightFax is installed on all user workstations at DFAS and a new system would require a new client, training of DFAS users on the new client, management of achived faxes, phonebooks and contacts previously created. The renewal of OpenText RightFax maintenance and support represents the only approach for the Government, ensuring continuity of operations and reducing the costs/user impact by enabling the use of the DSN network.<br />DFAS has over $300,000.000 invested in OpenText RightFax software through past acquisitions. The cost to procure another application would be in excess of $450,000.00, in addition to the training and installation costs that are associated with any new application. Consequently, the renewal of the OpenText RightFax maintenance represents the most cost effective approach for DFAS, ensuring continuity of operations without interruption.<br />(4) Market survey (indicate if any other firms were contacted or expressed interest)<br />Market research was conducted for the purpose of seeking as many potential sources as possible. Although OpenText RightFax is the sole manufacturer and provider of the service, there are multiple distributors who have expressed interest based on market research: Dynamic Solutions Group, Syscom Services, Advantage Technologies and AGSI Systems with the required maintenance and support available on the open market. An RFQ will be posted on FedBizOpps. Competition will be sought among all authorized resellers for the best possible pricing.<br />(5) Technical requirements personnel certification<br />I hereby certify that this justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement. I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advanced planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.<br />Signature DATE<br />David Banton<br />Technical Review</p>
<p>(6) Price Reasonableness Determination:</p>
<p>In determining a fair and reasonable price, the Contracting Officer will evaluate a more detailed breakdown from a formal Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The detailed estimate will provide the level of effort of individual items identified above and potential hardware/software categories, as well as estimated costs. The estimated costs of the hardware/software will be compared to established pricing on other Government contracts, such as the General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) for the same hardware/software categories and/or similar items. Additionally, price comparisons will also be accomplished from as many other sources as possible, including commercially as well as any Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC).<br />These products/services are available from one or multiple authorized resellers. Based on market research, it is anticipated that open market pricing will be fair and reasonable.<br />Leveraging DFAS' current use of the Vendor/Manufacturers product and services, along with open market price comparison, the contracting officer is confident in obtaining the best value for DFAS.</p>
<p>(7) Contracting Officer's certification</p>
<p>I hereby certify that this justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<p>Award Amount: $152,559.15</p>
<p>A purchase order has been issued to Ponderosa Packaging Corporation to acquire single and double wall fiberboard shipping containers constructed complete and in accordance with Stock Number Specifications for DLA Distribution (multiple locations).</p>
<p><br />This requirement was not synopsized as required by FAR 5.201. An exception to the synopsis requirement was taken as described in FAR 5.202(2) and 6.302-2 (unusual and compelling urgency). An unusual and compelling urgency for these items precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable, as such; limited competitive sources were contacted to provide price quotes. In accordance with FAR 13.104, multiple suppliers were contacted to provide a quote for the material as described in the schedule.</p>

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE. (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)
	
	

X	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.). Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources. 
	
	
	
	Fully automated, 80-samples per hour, reduced testing period (eight (8) minutes per test, can run up 
	to 10-samples per rack), closed samples (eliminates exposure to Bio-hazardous materials); patient
	Results are automatically updated into their records (eliminating transcription errors). Eliminates dietary and 
	Medicinal restrictions on patients while patient requirements in collecting bowel samples. 

X	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition. This proprietary data is: (If FAR 8.405-6 (a)(2)iii before posting. Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)
	
	
	
	POLYMEDCO OC FIT-Check - OC-Auto Micro 80 technology detects gastrointestinal bleeding 
	associated with disorders such as colorectal cancer, polyps, and colitis through several patents
	and proprietary hardware and software applications streamlining laboratory functions and 
	verification of results. 

	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment. 
	

	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing. Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system. 
	
	
	
	

	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
	
	
	
	
	
	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
	
	
	

(5)	DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:
	
	This vendors Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) (traditionally referred to as fecal occult blood test) 
	Does not impose dietary? or medicinal? restrictions on patients, reduces sample collection from 
	three (3) samples from three (3) separate bowel movements to one (1) sample from one (1) bowel
	Movement. This immunoassay screening method has improved sensitivity over conventional 
	testing procedures and improved patient compliance has the potential to reduce healthcare cost. 
	
	NOTE(S): 
	?Conventional guaiac based tests place dietary restrictions on meat, certain vegetables, fruit, and  
	Certain supplements (i.e. Vitamin C) three days prior to collecting samples
	? Conventional guaiac based tests place medical restrictions on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
	Drugs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin one (1) week prior to collecting samples
	
(6)	DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: 
	
	An internet search of existing Federal Supply Schedule (VA National Acquisition Center) mandatory
	Schedule holders to determine if they offered an alternative product that was comparable to the 
	POLYMEDCO OC Auto FIT-Check Micro 80 with its automated immunoassay format streamlines
	Laboratory functions and verification of results while reducing patient process in collecting samples 
	
(7)	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
	
	
	
(8)	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
	
	Some of the products/supplies used in performing these test may be available from other sources, 
	or could be acquired through the stations Prime Vendor. 
	
(9)	REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:	I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a 
	Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 528-13-3-8085-0134		 

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: GE Healthcare	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Bill Elliott; (301) 874-8631	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 3000 N. Grandview Ave., W-443; Waukesha, WI 53188

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Award of a firm-fixed price delivery order against VA NAC FSS Contract #V797P-2095D for the upgrade of the GE Combolab located in the cardiac cath lab at the Albany VA Medical Center.

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
	See attached table.

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $171,999	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   11/1/2013	
?

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).

Since 2005, the cath lab at the Albany VA has been using the GE Combolab.  The cath lab is now planning electrophysiology (EP) studies in the future and will consequently require an upgrade to a newer version of the Combolab.  The GE Combolab system is the only known system that combines both EP and cath lab functions into a single device.  Partial solutions are available from other manufacturers such as Philips or Bard.  These solutions, however, are not compatible with the current ComboLab system.  The Philips invasive cardiology system, for example, does not provide EP recording functions nor is it compatible with the GE ComboLab.  EP recording would entail the purchase of an additional, separate, piece of equipment.  Conversely, Bard provides an EP solution but lacks cath lab functionality.  Again, this would require an additional piece of equipment from an additional vendor.  

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  

Data migration is a critical aspect of this requirement.  The data collected and reports generated by the existing ComboLab system cannot presently be uploaded to VISTA or the CPRS Patient Record.  Consequently, this data exists solely on the GE ComboLab's proprietary databases.  This data is critical in QA reporting and future planning by cardiology management.  Quality assurance reports are generated and examined to investigate all aspects of the procedure.  This data is compared with historical trends as part of the quality improvement process.  The Data Management System (DMS) is an integral part of the ComboLab invasive recording system, housing ADT/HL7, VistA, Inventory, ACC (American College of Cardiology) reports, STS, charge capture billing and scheduling. DMS provides the necessary tools to complete administrative and clinical statistics for Quality Assurance (QA) for all procedures performed in the Cath Lab to include diagnostic cardiac caths, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), pacemaker implants, automatic implantable cardiodefibrillators (AICD), and Biventricular AICDs as well as an inventory program.  As this data is not presently maintained outside of the ComboLab software, data migration is required for this acquisition.  This DMS software upgrade cannot successfully be completed without the associated hardware upgrade, hence the need to upgrade the entire ComboLab system.  Upgrading to a newer version of the ComboLab will involve software upgrades that will provide for a ComboLab/VISTA interface.  Consequently, this upgrade will alleviate the data storage issue as, moving forward, all data will be imported to the Government-maintained IT system.

?

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The GE Combolab offers dual functionality in the cardiac cath lab, serving as both an invasive cardiology system and as an electrophysiology (EP) recording system.  The ComboLab solution is superior to purchasing a separate, distinct piece of equipment for each of the two functions.  The alternative of procuring two distinct pieces of equipment would result in significantly higher costs in terms of two procurements, clinical and biomedical engineering training on multiple platforms, stocking parts and supplies for two distinct pieces of equipment, and doubled service and maintenance costs.  The costs of such a course of action could far exceed any savings realized from increased competition.  Additionally, the ability to preserve historical data lends further value to this procurement strategy.  Data that is not presently available outside of the proprietary ComboLab system is important in ongoing QA reviews and departmental planning.  Loss of this data would be costly in terms of impaired ability to adequately review previous cath lab cases to make determinations for future courses of action.  Lastly, this order is in compliance with the VA NAC in Federal Supply Classifications of Group 65.  FSC 65 is a mandatory source of supply that must be utilized if the required items are available (VAAR 808.002(a)(3)).  FSS pricing has already been determined to be fair and reasonable.

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market research was initially conducted on GSA advantage and it appeared that some, but not all aspects of the ComboLab upgrade were available under the terms of GE Healthcare's FSS contract.  As the majority of the project was believed to be open market, a sources-sought synopsis was posted to FBO from 9/9/2013 through 9/16/2013 in an attempt to locate qualified vendors that could perform the upgrade.  This FBO was responded to by Mr. Bill Elliott, Director of Government Contract Sales for GE Healthcare.  Mr. Elliott informed me that all CLINs associated with this project were available under the existing FSS contract and provided a current FSS price list as evidence of his assertion.  Mr. Elliott further elaborated that, while there are many authorized small business distributors capable of performing this upgrade on GE's behalf, they would be doing so on an open-market basis.  Only GE Healthcare is permitted to perform the work as a FSS order.  No other responses to the RFI were received.

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
	
In completing the ComboLab upgrade, the equipment will gain the ability to interface with an additional piece of government-owned equipment: the St. Jude factional flow analyzer (RadiAnalyzer).  This interface will permit the ComboLab to organize and import additional data into the VISTA patient record.  This data was not previously maintained on a government-owned database.
