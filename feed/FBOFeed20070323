		Current health promotion efforts of Shiprock Service Unit and local tribal programs are often limited to the immediate Shiprock Area.  There are very few health promotion or wellness activities available to residents of the 24 outlying chapters within the Shiprock Service Unit.

The lack of opportunities for exercise and wellness activities is a major factor in the development of increasing rates of chronic illness among Navajo people.

Increasing rates of chronic diseases among Navajo people in Shiprock Service Unit are often related to changes in exercise and nutrition habits and patterns over the last 50 - 100 years.  The lack of availability of wellness and exercise facilities is a significant factor in the current epidemic of obesity faced by Navajo people.

	In addition, current high death rates of motor vehicle crashes and intentional injuries related to high rates of alcohol and substance abuse among local young people have been related to lack of positive available opportunities.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items the procurement of a Thermogravimetric Analyzer-Mass Spectrometer to TA Instruments, 109 Lukens Drive, Newcastle, DE 19720.  This item is sole source since TA Instruments is the only known source that has a unique design that puts together the Thermogravimetric Analyzer and Mass Spectrometer in one equipment.  This is compatible with existing in house TA software-developed-equipped computer that runs other Government owned TA Instruments.   This acquisition is unrestricted.  The NAICS code is 334516.  





The following item will be procured:  

Minimum Specification for Thermogravimetric Analyzer and Mass Spectrometer 

The instrument must have:


•	Temperature Range:  The TGA instrument shall allow for a measurable temperature range of ambient to 1200°C

•	Heating Rate Range:  As this instrument will be used for kinetics analyses, a wide range of achievable heating rates is critical.  The instrument shall be able to control to heating rates as low as 0.1°C/min with noise levels over 10°C no greater than ±0.01°C/min (unsmoothed).  The instrument must also be able to control heating rates as fast as 500°C/min.  Examples of data files illustrating this capability shall be supplied and will be used for verification.

•	Balance Sensitivity:  The TGA balance will have a sensitivity of at least 0.1 &#61549;g (microgram).  Examples of data files illustrating this capability shall be supplied and will be used for verification.

•	Baseline Performance:  The TGA baseline shall exhibit less than 10 &#61549;g (microgram) of drift over the temperature range ambient to 1000°C (uncorrected) in either air or N2 atmosphere.  The TGA isothermal baseline will drift no more than 5 &#61549;g (microgram) over 18 hours.  

•	Purge Gas Control:  The TGA shall include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gases, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment.  The flow rate must also be adjustable via software during an experiment.  The flow rates must be data logged into the resulting data file.

•	Robotic Autosampler/Pan Punching:  Because this instrument will be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it must come equipped with a robotic autosampler containing at least 20 sample positions.  The autosampler must also include a pan punching mechanism, by which samples can be kept sealed in a hermetic environment, and punched open just prior to loading.  Ideally, this pan punching will produce a large breach in the pan, rather than a pin-hole, as our materials rely on efficient sample/gas interaction.

•	Variable Rate Control:  The TGA instrument will include some form of automatic variable rate control to improve resolution.  Ideally, the heating rate will be continuously adjusted as a function of sample mass loss rate, as opposed to a “stepwise isothermal” approach.   

•	Automatic Calibration:  The TGA instrument shall allow for automatic, unattended calibration of both temperature (curie-point standards) and mass.  These calibrations wil be programmable and schedulable from within the operating software.

•	Software:  As this TGA will be used by numerous researchers, it is critical that the analysis software be installed on multiple computers.  As such, the analysis program should be un-keyed, and should include a site license such that it may be installed on an unlimited number of computers within AFRL/ PRSM.  The data file format will easily allow sharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents, which are readable by the same data analysis package.  The data analysis program shall also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.  These capabilities must be demonstrated for product acceptance.

•	The TGA must also include operating software which allows for the instrument to be fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need for operator presence.  Calibrations must include weight and temperature (curie point).  Scheduling capabilities must be present, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can be programmed to perform during normal quiescent periods, such as overnight or on weekends.  The software must also be capable of sending automatic communications as to the status of these calibration/verification experiments, either by email or instant messaging, so that the operator is fully apprised of their status.  

•	In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the scheduling component.  These tests should verify the performance of various instrument components such as autosampler motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc.  The results of these tests will be logged and the option to automatically report the result via email or instant messaging should be included.  

•	The operating software will also be capable of periodically and automatically checking for updates via an internet connection, and downloading/installing those updates if desired

•	The mass spectrometer must have a mass range 1-300 amu 
•	The instrument will have full range gauge for MS protection and diagnostics 
•	The mass spectrometer will possess ArcNet Fiber optic communications port for high speed data transmission
•	The mass spectrometer will have a bakeout jacket, heats vacuum chamber to effect contamination removal 
•	Inlet heater from the TGA to MS will be  controllable to 200C to prevent condensation in the inlet
•	The instrument will hava all metal seals in high vacuum area, reduces backgrounds
•	Quantitative analysis software must have  output in %,ppm, ppb - deconvolution of overlapping peaks.
•	There will be 1 Digital Input, for triggering MS.
•	There will be 2 Digital Outputs, relay O/P for interfacing to other instrumentation/alarms.
•	There must also be 2 Analog Inputs, -5...+5vdc for integration of external data (temp, pressure etc) and 2 analog Outputs, -5...+5vdc for transfer of signals to other instrumentation.
•	The instrument must be able to monitor up to 64 masses in MID mode.
•	The must be split flow turbo for pumping inlet gas
•	The instrument must have field axis technology for maximum transmission of ions
•	The instrument must be able to perform 8 orders of magnitude dynamic range in a single scan
•	The instrument shall be able to detect possible xenon in air
•	Data collection speed of 50 points per second must be available.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center East, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, NC has submitted a requirement to procure a Danobat Vertical Grinding Machine, Model DAN-VTG 700/700 with an option to buy a Danobat Horizontal Grinding Machine, Model DANTIP R2 700/1500 and tooling for grinding, de-burring, and measuring T58 and T64 rotors and compressor cases.  The requested grinders and tooling are required for match grinding of T58 and T64 rotors and compressors.  The equipment will enable the FRC to increase its capacity for match grinding through integration with the current grinders; and as such must be 100% compatible with the Danobat grinders that they will integrate with.  The Fleet Readiness Center East (FRC), Cherry Point, recently procured a Match Grinder Cell (consisting of integrated vertical and horizontal grinders) from Danobat Group via the Davis Taylor Forster (DTF) Company, under Contract M00146-03-M-9016 which was awarded on a competitive basis.  The clearances between compressor rotor blades, stator blades and lands are critical to engine performance and must be precision match ground with accurate data and without errors in communication between grinders. Sole source procurement of this new equipment from DTF will ensure 100% compatibility for match grinding when integrated with the existing Danobat grinders.  The DTF Company is the proprietary US supplier of these grinders and as such the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Therefore, sole source procurement of this new equipment from DTF will ensure 100% compatibility for match grinding when integrated with the existing Danobat grinders.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The solicitation will be posted electronically at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 17 April 2007 with proposals due approximately 17 May 2007.  This requirement is contingent upon receiving FY 07 funds.  The NAICS Code is 333512 with a corresponding size standard of 500 employees.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to award a contract modification on a sole source basis for an additional 453 complete systems and associated spares via modification to contract M67854-07-C-2062.  The additional 453 units are an increase to the Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) to support an Urgent Universal Need Statement (UUNS) for the Target Location, Designation and Hand-Off System (TLDHS) from Stauder Technologies, Inc., 115 Mexico Court, Suite D, St. Peters, MO. 63376.  The justification permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract modification is anticipated.  The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $15,000,000.  The Period of Performance is 13 months from issuance of modification until final delivery.  On 11 April 2006, an MROC Decision Memorandum 23-200!  6 was released approving the Excalibur Unitary GPS Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) and I MEF TACP Suites for FACS and JTACS.  The TLDHS is the USMC solution to TACP/FO Suites.  The TLDHS is the forward observer’s (FO) entry device into AFTADS for requesting Excalibur missions.  The fielding for the M-777A2 155-mm howitzer with Excalibur munitions is scheduled for 3rd quarter FY07.  Stauder Technologies has developed and implemented unique algorithms in their software package.  This development has resulted in an original system whose function cannot be duplicated by any existing package or by a modification to any existing package.  The Government does not have the source code for TLDHS and therefore cannot provide it with a solicitation.  As a result of Stauder Technologies’ extensive experience, any competition would result in unrecoverable, extensive duplication of cost.  Moreover, award of the TLDHS effort to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulf!  illing the agency’s urgent requirements and could upset the present pr ogram schedule by introducing unknown variables and schedule risk.  Based on the years taken to develop this capability to date, it is not expected that another source could step in, replicate the capability, test and field and remain on track to sustain.  Currently the Government does not have a technical data package which includes software.  No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding. However, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement. All communications shall be in writing. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.”  See numbered note 22.

The Offeror who is awarded the contract shall have access to landfills and/or transfer stations that are not legally prohibited from accepting the refuse requirements of this contract, which are gathered from the state of Illinois.  The State of Wisconsin has imposed legal restrictions on the disposal of Illinois solid waste.  Therefore, disposal sites located in Wisconsin cannot be utilized for disposal of Illinois Solid Waste during the base period and all option periods.  Although some aspects of these restrictions were invalidated by the seventh circuit court of appeals in 1995, the court suggested a means by which restrictions could be imposed so that it is not clear whether Illinois Waste can be accepted for disposal in Wisconsin.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is interested in soliciting proposals from all interested organizations to serve as the Clinical Trial Coordinating Center (CTCC) for a large, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing three possible approaches to guiding warfarin therapy initiation:  1) initiation of warfarin therapy based on an algorithm using clinical information and the individual’s genotype relative to two genes known to influence warfarin metabolism (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes); 2) initiation of warfarin therapy based on an algorithm using only clinical information; and 3) a standard, guideline-based initiation strategy.  The trial would randomize approximately 2,000 participants with any indication for chronic long term anticoagulation and no previous treatment with warfarin.  Participants will be recruited over 18 months and followed for one year. The CTCC in collaboration with the Steering Committee will identify, select, subcontract and coordinate a network of clinics that can adequately select a large number of eligible participants, randomize and follow them according to the study protocol, and obtain the genotyping data.  In addition to acquiring genotypic and clinical data, the trial will include detailed measurements of anticoagulation status, collect detailed information on factors (nutritional, pharmacologic and others) influencing the anticoagulation status, and collect quality of life and cost-effectiveness data. The trial will include a central laboratory/core facility to serve as DNA repository for quality control of the local genotypic laboratories and DNA storage for future analyses. The core facility will also collect and store blood for both immediate and future studies of biomarkers contributing to the bleeding and thromboembolic risk in trial participants.  These studies may include, but are not limited to, DNA extraction and analysis for investigation of relevant pathway genes, genome-wide association, and sequencing.   The CTCC will identify, select, subcontract with, and oversee a subcontract for the Central Laboratory. Only one contract will be awarded for this project.

The CTCC will coordinate all aspects of the research and manage and analyze the patient and research (both clinical and genotypic) data.  The CTCC will manage and coordinate the efforts of the clinical sites.  It is expected that approximately 15 sites will be required to enroll the large number of patients needed for the study. The Principal Investigators from the CTCC and clinical sites, the NHLBI Project Officer and a National Human Genome Research institute (NHGRI) representative will form a Steering Committee that serves to provide scientific direction to the program.   The CTCC will prepare confidential reports and analyses for NHLBI review committees including a Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  Personnel must be knowledgeable and experienced in the design, conduct and analysis of pharmacogenomic studies, as well as in large, complex multicenter clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases or other randomized prospective clinical trials of similar complexity.  Medical and scientific expertise in pharmacogenomics and in clinical conditions requiring oral anticoagulation, in data collection, management, monitoring, quality control, management of medication side effects and adverse reactions to drug therapy, data analysis and reporting is required. Institutional ability in dealing with regulatory issues involving genetic analyses, with quality control and analysis of genome-wide association and sequencing data is required. The CTCC will provide leadership in the statistical issues including the design of the study protocol and analysis of study data.  The CTCC will be responsible for the design, selection, and management of data collection tools and ensuring quality control, including the design and management of a study website. The CTCC will coordinate the randomization of patients into the trial and will be responsible for maintenance of data forms, computer systems for storage and retrieval, and for ensuring the timely collection, entry and editing of the data.  The CTCC should be able to provide continuous assistance to the clinical sites for issues related to study execution. The CTCC will be responsible for coordinating communications among the various components of the study, and for scheduling meetings and conference calls of the study committees as needed.  The CTCC will also organize the PRC and DSMB meetings and prepare statistical reports and the minutes of these meetings.  The CTCC in collaboration with the NHLBI will arrange and conduct site visits to the clinical sites and central laboratory.    This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of 3 1/2 years.  The contract will be a cost-reimbursement, completion-type. THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request for Proposals must be downloaded from the NIH Web Site, and will be available on or about April 8, 2007, at the following internet address at the FedBizOpps Website: http//www.fedbizopps.gov and at the NHLBI Website: http//www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding inits/index.htm.  The estimated due date for proposals is on or about June 20, 2007.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Sharron Doherty, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-3075
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR Residential Branch (ESRB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Energy Programs Consortium (EPC), in Washington, DC. The purpose of this acquisition is to develop an energy efficiency financing program targeted at low-to-moderate income homeowners. This program  will be designed to allow these homeowners to purchase or refinance a home at a lower interest rate than their current mortgage, while borrowing amounts to pay for cost-effective energy efficiency improvements based on the "whole-house" approach of the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Program.  This requirement will make energy efficiency financing more attractive and accessible to homeowners of low-to-moderate income who own above-market rate mortgages and whose homes typically are older and very energy inefficient, thus allowing these homeowners to make energy-efficient improvements.  This in turn plays a significant role in reducing the nation's greenhouse gas emissions from home energy use, which promotes CPPD's goal of reducing U.S. domestic emissions of greenhouse gases via more energy efficient buildings.   Energy Programs Consortium (EPC) is uniquely qualified to develop  an integrated energy efficiency loan program that utilizes Home Performance with ENERGY STAR for low-income homeowners. EPC has the staff, background and experience to conduct this project, and to produce results quickly. This requirement will build on efforts already made by EPC staff to develop  an energy efficiency finance program with backing by some foundations with whom they have established solid relationships. EPC is a nonprofit energy research and demonstration organization sponsored by the four main state organizations representing state officials: National Association of State  Energy Officials, National Association of State Community Services Programs, National Association of State Regulatory Utility Commissioners and National Energy Assistance Directors' Association. The buy-in and participation of these state organizations would be critical to successfully developing  and delivering an energy efficiency loan program based on the "whole-house" approach to home efficiency used by the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR program since implementation and delivery would depend on the joint cooperation of state energy offices, housing finance agencies and utility  commissions in implementing and marketing such a program to low-income homeowners. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received  within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon  the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Sharron K. Doherty via the e-mail link below.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Emory University, 1784 N. Decatur Road, Atlanta, GA 30322.  The  title of the project is CLINICAL CARE FOR WORKERS WITH POTENTIAL WORK EXPOSURE.   CDC staff, guest researchers, visiting scientists, and contractors could require urgent, immediate local hospital care under isolation conditions after exposure or suspected exposure and/or showing signs of disease due to serious communicable infectious agents (such as Biosafety level 4 agents, novel influenza strains) or agents of unknown origin.  CDC staff working in research laboratory settings with highly hazardous infectious agents and those returning from performing field epidemiology in countries where the corresponding diseases are endemic could be   exposed to or infected by unusually contagious and dangerous pathogens.  Additionally, CDC workers are engaged in other public health responses, both domestically and internationally, where exposure or illness with a high-consequence pathogen could occur.  Such exposure and infection could require that the individual be isolated as a measure to prevent secondary transmission to other individuals.   When this occurs, medical examination, laboratory procedures, treatment, and hospitalization under isolation and high-environmental containment conditions may be necessary.  

The contract covers the care of and isolation of persons exposed to all biosafety level 4 agents, novel influenza strains, and other high consequence pathogens.  It should also cover agents that may not have been fully characterized, but are nonetheless, related to occupational exposure or illness.  This contract will also include annual review and revisions to protocols, annual training, reporting, and records management responsibilities.

Responsible sources who believe they can provide the required services may submit a written capability statement, via e-mail (only), no later than 15 days from the published date of this announcement.  Telephone inquiries will be considered nonresponsive.   If no responses are received the award will be made to Emory University.

<DESC>For more than 50 years Edwards Air Force Base has been the home of more major milestones in flight than any other place on earth. Covering nearly 301,000 acres, Edwards is located in the Mojave Desert, adjacent to Rogers Dry Lakebed. Although remote, Edwards AFB is home to military and their families, as well as employer to a large number of civilian employees. 

Sports Day is a base wide event drawing 3,000 ? 4,000 participants from both military and civilian demographics. The participants attend events at a variety of locations on the base. The event hosts a wide range of sporting activities such as golf, bowling, running, softball basketball, swimming, horseshoes and even fishing. The day starts with a breakfast and ends with an awards ceremony and a Bar-B-Que.

Sponsorship is fundamental to the success and continuation of this event. Edwards AFB invites you to join in Sports Day by becoming a commercial sponsor. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. 

In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure. The level of exposure is determined by the level of sponsorship, with all sponsors prominently acknowledged throughout the event. Sponsor exposure may include name and logo recognition on all event print media, including posters, signage, and banners, brochures, pictures and media coverage. More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered. Request for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than 4 April 2007. All offers will be considered.

Unfortunately we will not be able to accept offers for sponsorship from any contractor, including their affiliates, subcontract arrangements, teaming partners, or join venture partners who are currently or intending to participate in any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) or who will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,00 or more.
If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the government.

This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non appropriated fun instrumentality of the United States Government and does not obligate appropriated funds of the Government.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>A--Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the 3rd Generation Infrared Integrated Dewar Cooler Assemblies Manufacturing Technology (MANTECH) Program
<SOLNBR>W909MY-07-R-0012
<RESPDATE>050707
<ARCHDATE>07062007
<CONTACT>tpatterson, 703-325-9088
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-07-R-0012, soliciting proposals for the 3rd Generation Infrared Integrated Dewar Cooler Assemblies Manufacturing Technology (MANTECH) Program has been posted on the Single Face to Industry website, https://abop. monmouth.army.mil.  This BAA seeks proposals of initiatives that address the high cost drivers of the VAM and 3rd Gen IR IDCA manufacturing at the component and/or assembly level.  The main objective of this effort is to reduce the cost required to manufac ture 3rd Gen Infrared Integrated Dewar and Cooler Assemblies (3rd Gen IR IDCAs.)  Offerors are directed to access the website for the complete BAA.  Following is an extraction from the BAA. BACKGROUND.  The US Army NVESD is seeking ideas on ways to improve  Manufacturing Technology (ManTech), thereby resulting in a  reduction of  the production costs of 3d Gen IR IDCAs. The 3d Gen IR IDCAs are a vital part of the common 3d Gen IR B-Kit currently being developed by NVESD.  Due to demanding military requiremen ts for system packaging and performance, the ManTech program will focus on cost reduction while maintaining component and system requirements for the 3d Gen IR B-Kit.  The  3d Gen IR IDCAs are being designed per the 3d Gen IR B-Kit Interface Control Docume nt 80063-A3315461 and Performance Requirement documents PRF-A3315460.  Third Gen IR IDCAs will be posted on the IBOP website and include innovative technology such as dual band infrared Mid Wave and Long Wave (MW/LW) focal plane arrays and Variable Apertur e Mechanism (VAM) Dewars. The VAM is a critical new component of the 3d Gen IR IDCA that provides multiple f/number operation in a compact Dewar package.  This provides optical optimization for two opposite requirements  Wide Area Search (WAS) and Long Ra nge Identification (LRID). The complexity of the VAM and the small size requirements of the 3d Gen IR IDCA require initiatives to increase producability and lower manufacturing costs.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.  The Government is seeking manufacturing cost-reduc tion initiatives at the component and/or assembly level. The ManTech program objective is to decrease unit production costs of the 3d Gen IR IDCA by 39% based on a unit quantity of 4600 over 12 years. The program is seeking proposals which include : 1. new  or improved materials, components, configurations, and designs at the component level, which can be proven in component-level technology demonstrators for the 3d Gen IR IDCA and VAM; 2. new or improved processes, process controls, tests, fixtures, tooling , and reduced cycle times at the assembly level, which can be proven in assembly-level technology demonstrators for the 3d Gen IR IDCA and VAM.  Other topic areas are encouraged if manufacturing and production cost savings can be demonstrated.   It is desi red that individual initiatives have a period of performance less than 12 months.This is a three year program.  The first two years of the program will focus on VAM component and assembly improvements.  The remainder of the program will focus on other 3d G en IR IDCA component and assembly improvements. DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS.  In addition to delivery of reports or other deliverables proposed by the offeror, technology demonstrators at the component and/or assembly level are required at the completion of each  initiative.  Integrated 3d Gen IDCA technology demonstrators that show objective cost reductions are encouraged at the completion of the ManTech initiatives as well.  Some of the technology demonstrators may be used for further testing to verify complianc e with performance, quality, reliability, and environmental requirements.  IDCA PRODUCTION BASELINE AND MODEL.  An initial analysis of a current 3d Gen IR IDCA design will be used to establish the baseline. A production model of 10 IDCAs per month for 3 ye ars starting in 2010 will be used to establish projected production costs.  Benefits such as improvements in quality and reliability and cost savings throughout  the life cycle should also be established and considered.  All awardees will be required to develop and use a cost model to track cost reductions.  The model shall predict the unit costs of the 3d Gen IR IDCAs while varying input parameters to include as a minimum: i) quantity; ii) with and without integration of manufacturing process initiatives; iii) yields; iv) labor content and v) cycle times and throughput.  TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.  Reports detailing purpose, background, developments, criterion for down selection, test methods, and conclusions are required at the completion of each initiative in order to meet technology transfer requirements. A minimum of one industry day will be held as part of the technology transfer effort. This industry day will infor m US DoD industry on program results. ELIGIBILITY.  A prospective recipient must also meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, ability to comply with the performance schedule, prior record of performance, integrity, organization, e xperience, operational controls, technical skills facilities and equipment.  Proposals will be considered from organizations interested in conducting scientific research, such as colleges and universities, commercial firms, nonprofit research institutes, s mall business and small disadvantaged business concerns, historically black colleges and universities and minority business enterprises and institutions.  Foreign contractors may also participate in this BAA.  While classified contracts are not anticipated , contingent upon the proposed technology solution, contractors may require access to classified material or information.  In such situations, only those organizations that can meet the established security requirements are eligible to participate in this BAA.  Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) are permitted to participate; however, offerors are reminded of the limitations in their use (see FAR 35.017) and must provide documentation in the proposal that work is not otherwise available  from the private sector.    For additional information and guidance concerning qualifications and standards for responsibility of perspective contractors, please refer to FAR Part 9.  BASIS FOR AWARD.  The selection of contract(s) for award will be based on a scientific and engineering peer review evaluation of proposals. The business and contractual aspects, including cost, will also be considered as a part of the evaluation.  Evaluation and selection of proposal(s) for award will be made on the basis of the potential benefits occurring to the Government when weighed against the cost of the proposal.

<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District announces its intention to award a sole source Purchase Order to Gannett Fleming, Inc. to update Plans and Specifications and for Title II services for the Renewal of the Railroad Signal System at the Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge, Cape Cod Canal, Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. The work consists of updating Plans and Specifications for the design of the renewal of the signal system, which were originally completed by Gannett Fleming, Inc.  The work also includes Title II services such as review of submittals, site visits, and eng ineering and design during construction.   Design of railroad signal systems requires an understanding of the detailed safety requirements contained within Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations and specialized design knowledge and experience, which Gannett Fleming provides.  Additionall y, Gannett Fleming orginally prepared the Plans and Specifications that require updating.  In order to maintain continuity of and responsibility for the design, it is necessary to use the original designer of record.  For the Title II services, utilizing t he designer of record again maintains the responsiblity for the design.  In addition, it also maintains continuity between design and construction, which will provide for the safe functionality of the renewed signal system. Therefore, we consider this acquisition to be available from only one source, Gannett Fleming, Inc. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a firm-fixed price Purchase Order. This notice is NOT a Request for Quotations, therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued.

DESCRIPTION
(Note:  This BAA Addendum 2 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)

The ability to safely and covertly gain access to denied or hostile areas and perform useful tasks provides critical advantages to warfighters over a broad spectrum of military operations. An effective and logistically attractive means for gaining entry to denied areas is to deploy an unmanned platform, such as a robot. However, often the only available points of entry are small openings in buildings, walls, under doors, etc. In these cases, a robot must be soft enough to squeeze or traverse through small openings, yet large enough to carry an operationally meaningful payload. Current robotic platforms are constructed primarily from hard materials and, while capable of locomotion with embedded payloads, cannot change their physical dimensions to rapidly traverse arbitrary size/shape openings whose dimensions are much smaller than the robot itself and are not known a-priori.

In response to this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals to develop Chemical Robots (ChemBots): soft, flexible, mobile objects that can identify and maneuver through openings smaller than their static structural dimensions; reconstitute size, shape, and functionality after traversal; carry meaningful payloads; and perform tasks. ChemBots represent the convergence of soft materials chemistry and robotics to create a fundamentally new class of soft meso-scale robots that can perform the following key unit operations in sequence:

1.  	Travel a distance;
2.  	Traverse an arbitrary-shaped opening much smaller than the largest characteristic dimension of the ChemBot;
3.  	Reconstitute size, shape, and functionality after traversing the opening; 
4.  	Travel a distance; and
5.  	Perform a function using the embedded payload.

The first phase of this program focuses on the development of novel materials, material systems, and/or robot architectures, that can both move and morph under the influence of an appropriate driving force (e.g., electromagnetic, acoustic, chemical, etc.), as well as demonstration of a rudimentary meso-scale ChemBot. The specific Phase I milestone is presented under Program Goals and Milestones.

BACKGROUND
To achieve the ChemBots vision, key technical breakthroughs will center on the development of materials and architectures that can both locomote and reversibly change their form factor in order to traverse small openings and reconstitute size/shape on the other side. There are two basic traversal mechanisms: squeeze through the opening, or first transform to the appropriate form factor and then traverse. Critical features that must be considered in the ultimate ChemBot devices are:

1.  	Morphability in all three dimensions;
2.  	Architectures that can sense and morph responsively to openings, e.g., using local tactile sensing;
3.  	Flexible backbone structures or architectures that themselves morph or dissolve, then reconstitute - keystone that enables system;
4.  	Payloads that remain viable after traversal. Hard payloads, including power sources, must be smaller than the largest characteristic size of the opening. Novel soft payloads that morph and reconstitute may be larger than this size;
5.  	Modest power requirements. ChemBots may be self-powered, self-consuming, or energy-scavenging;
6.  	Autonomous or user-controlled operation, depending on application. ChemBots must not be tethered to controllers or power sources;
7.  	Meso-scale in size, preferentially with size-scalable architecture; and
8.  	Robust over typical range of military operational conditions (temperature, humidity, rain, etc.).

Nature provides many examples of ChemBot functionality. Many soft creatures, including mice, octopi, and insects, readily traverse openings barely larger than their largest ?hard? component, via a variety of reversible mechanisms. These mechanisms include (1) using elastic materials to twist, crumple, and bend with many degrees of freedom, (2) utilizing the flexibility of the musculoskeletal structure to squeeze through openings, and (3) exploiting reversible changes in modulus (i.e., flexible to stiff) to achieve dimensional reductions which can exceed 10:1. Soft invertebrates typically locomote by crawling, e.g., peristalsis (earthworms, caterpillars), pedal waves (snails, slugs), cilial motions, etc., and utilize means such as gripping, hooking, and suction to ensure sufficient traction with the terrain.

Potential approaches to achieve soft meso-scale robots include, but are not limited to:

1.  	Gel-solid phase transitions;
2.  	Non-Newtonian systems (e.g., shear-thinning and -thickening fluids and gels);
3.  	Shape-memory materials;
4.  	Electro- and magneto-rheological materials;
5.  	Electrostatic, electrostrictive, electro-osmotic, electroadhesive, and dielectrophoretic phenomena;
6.  	Reversible chemical and/or particle association and dissociation;
7.  	Geometric transitions, e.g., folding phenomena;
8.  	Modulus-shifting materials; and
9.  	New classes of materials and/or system architectures.

Any innovative approach that meets the goals of this BAA will be considered.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES
The goal of this program is to develop a payload-carrying soft robotics platform that can be used in military operations to access denied territory through small openings and perform functions.

The ChemBots Program will be separated into two phases. The goal of Phase I is to develop critical material/architecture technologies and demonstrate a rudimentary meso-scale ChemBot with moving and morphing capabilities. Depending on the success of the Phase I demonstrations, the goal of Phase II will be to develop a suite of fully-functional ChemBots for specific applications.

Phase I will be a research effort of not more than 24 months; however, shorter duration efforts are strongly encouraged.

The Phase I milestone is:

1.  	Demonstrate a ChemBot, approximately the size (but not necessarily the form-factor) of a regulation softball (i.e., 30 cm circumference; 10 cm diameter; 500 cm3 volume), that can:
a)  	travel a distance of 5 meters at a speed of 0.25 meters/minute;
b) 	achieve a 10-fold reduction in its largest dimension; and
c)  	traverse through a 1 cm opening of arbitrary geometry and reconstitute its original size and shape, in 15 seconds.

Phase II is expected to be a research effort of between 18 and 24 months. The Phase II milestones will be determined by the results of the Phase I effort and the specific applications that are proposed. 

To realize the program vision and meet the Phase I milestone, each research effort requires performers with expertise in materials chemistry and physics, robotics, command and control algorithms, and systems integration.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION
We anticipate a two-stage source selection. It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED that a white paper be submitted according to the guidelines provided below.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks information as to potential qualified small businesses and other sources with specific experience and expertise to provide for the design, engineering, fielding, testing, certification/accreditation, and operational support of an enterprise-level, Protection Level 5 (PL-5) multi-level security, thin client environment, including full system and user documentation.  The system design shall allow for simultaneous access to multiple security enclaves (SBU, Secret, Top Secret and SCI) and provide the capability for sharing information across security enclaves.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

   DTRA is a combat support and defense agency, charged with the vital national security mission of reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA is the principal source for the warfighter and other organizations to understand and plan against WMD threats. The agency supports the three pillars of the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction:  nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence management. Moreover, DTRA has been recently designated to form and lead U.S. Strategic Command?s (USSTRATCOM) Center for Combating WMD in direct support of that command?s mission to integrate and synchronize DoD in combating WMD across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Leadership, Materiel, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTLMPF) spectrum.

   In order to more efficiently support the various elements of DTRA's mission and to reduce IT support costs, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) is considering implementing a multi-level security solution to integrate four primary security domains, Unclassified, Collateral Secret, Collateral Top Secret, and Top Secret/SCI.  Candidate solutions should provide for simultaneous access to multiple domains and enclaves via a single ultra-thin client workstation.  Additionally, the candidate solution must be able to support and interface additional networks and enclaves within the above classification structure, such as, but not limited to, the Non-classified Internet Protocol Routable Network (NIPRNet), the Secret Internet Protocol Routable Network (SIPRNet), the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIX), Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), Combined Federated Battle Laboratories (CFBL) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications Systems (JWICS).  

   Upon Final Operational Capability (FOC), the proposed solution shall provide the capability to transfer data (e.g. text, Microsoft office documents) across domains from low to high (i.e. from SBU to Secret, and from Secret to Top Secret/SCI) and support a releasing process to transfer information from high-to-low security domains.  Candidate solutions shall be certified to be in compliance with PL-5 architecture requirements as detailed in the Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 (DCID 6/3). 

Scope of Effort:

   The multi-level security thin client solution will be implemented at the Defense Threat Reduction Center (DTRC), located in the National Capitol Region on the Fort Belvoir Military Reservation.  An enterprise-level implementation may require up to 2000 thin client workstations.  Access to JWICS thin-client workstations shall be limited to SCIF areas.  

   Plans for this effort include implementation of a PL-5 certified pilot system with Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in late calendar year 2007.  Pending successful completion of the pilot phase, full implementation will begin to include migration across the entire enterprise and implementation of low to high information gateways.  Final Operational Capability (FOC) is anticipated to occur late calendar year 2008.

Notional tasks the source must be able to execute include:
- Site survey to include discovery;
- System design;
- Purchase of required equipment, software and associated support licenses;
- System testing;
- System implementation;
- Full certification and accreditation support to include management of Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) and Top Secret and Below Interoperability (TSABI) processes;
- User and administrator training;
- On-site engineering and technical support (contract option following FOC); and,
- Full system documentation to include configuration management, drawings, certification and accreditation documentation, and end-user and system administrator usage, configuration and configuration guides.

Mandatory Requirements:

Responsible sources should demonstrate:
- Proven experience in design and fielding of PL-4 and PL-5 certified enterprise-wide multi-level security architectures similar in scope and complexity to the proposed effort;
- IPv6 compliance status of potential solution;
- Ability to integrate Common Access Card (CAC) authentication for authentication, encryption and non-repudiation;
- Ability to provide proven security certification and accreditation support capabilities from cradle to grave (including: SABI and TSABI process management; DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP)/ DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) accreditation process support and documentation; DoD Intelligence Information System (DODIIS) accreditation process support and documentation; and Cross Domain System Management Office coordination);
- Mature project management, system engineering and design, configuration management, quality assurance and system support processes;
- Intrinsic staffing resources sufficient to field a project similar in scope and complexity to the proposed effort, including personnel with all requisite security clearances and information assurance certifications in accordance with DoD Directive 8570.1;
- Capability to provide on-site engineering support services during development and after system implementation; and,
- Ability to deliver end-user and system administration training and support.

   DTRA's intent is to award a single award cost plus fixed fee contract.  Any prospective small business awardee must perform 51% of the required effort.  The performance period is anticipated to be from May 2007 through May 2009.  On-site engineering and service support and training support may be included as contract options following FOC.  This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP); it is a market research tool being used to determine the availability, business size and existing contractual vehicles of qualified experienced sources prior to issuing an RFP.

The SMP will specify the Contractor's implementation of security for priority resources.  The SMP shall support the daily operational missions and threats of CCAFS plus the various contingencies to ensure security of priority resources.  The plan shall include the integration of security requirements for resources protection; methodology for expanding the workforce when required to support variable security needs; command, control, and communication procedures for Security Forces; and maintenance of Security Forces personnel qualifications.          

The contractor would maintain public safety and the safety of the workforce.  The contractor would maintain safe and secure operating locations and be flexible and innovative in protecting and preserving physical and environmental assets.  The contractor would professionally manage resources and the infrastructure to ensure sustainability, reliability, energy conservation and cost efficiency of the facilities, systems and equipment at CCAFS.  The contractor would provide facilities support and assure superior customer satisfaction by accomplishing the work described herein within the time limits specified, the constraints present, the schedules and budgets identified by the customer.

Secret facility and safeguarding clearances will be required in the performance of this work. Companies proposing on this acquisition must be U.S. owned and personnel supporting this contract must have a minimum of a Secret Clearance.

The Offeror who is awarded the contract shall have access to landfills and/or transfer stations that are not legally prohibited from accepting the refuse requirements of this contract, which are gathered from the state of Illinois.  The State of Wisconsin has imposed legal restrictions on the disposal of Illinois solid waste.  Therefore, disposal sites located in Wisconsin cannot be utilized for disposal of Illinois Solid Waste during the base period and all option periods.

SUBJECT: 4P ARCHITECT-ENGINEER 08 (4PAE08) SERVICES: TITLE I, TITLE II, AND OTHER ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING SERVICES TO ADMINISTER, COORDINATE AND TECHNICALLY SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING, AND FACILITY SUSTAINMENT, RESTORATION AND MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS OF INTEREST TO THE GOVERNMENT

POC:  Ms. Janie Campos, Contracting Officer, (210) 536-4411, janie.campos@brooks.af.mil; Ms. Jo Ann Hodges, Contracting Specialist, (210) 536-4481, joann.hodges@brooks.af.mil 
DESC:  NAICS 562910 (Environmental Remediation Services) applies to this acquisition, with a size standard of 500 Employees.  The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks-City Base, TX desires to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support environmental, military construction (MILCON), military family housing (MFH), and facility sustainment, restoration, and modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government worldwide.  These programs could include work in  remote, austere and/or hostile locations, but would primarily be on locations at Air Force installations in the 50 United States.  The work includes all efforts necessary to manage and execute Title I, Title II, and other A-E services primarily for environmental projects including restoration, conservation, planning, compliance, and pollution prevention.  The work also includes a growing secondary requirement for traditional A-E Services for design and construction oversight supporting, MILCON, MFH, and SRM programs.

Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services, and preparation of operating and design manuals.  These services relate to specific Environmental, MILCON, MFH, and other traditional construction projects, as well as facility SRM, and consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data, and preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.

Title II services include construction quality assurance and oversight of facility construction, SRM, and environmental projects.  These services are related to a specific or proposed construction or environmental project and consist of supervision and inspection.

Other A&E services include, but are not limited to:
  A full range of support associated with conventional design for construction, maintenance, and repair of facilities, including MFH, on military installations within the CONUS and OCONUS  as well as other locations of interest to the government.  These efforts include advanced planning, programming, studies, investigations, LEED TM analysis and documentation, interior design services, and other services not associated with a specific construction project.  
  Support necessary for the implementation of the Family Housing Master Plan Program, the Dormitory Master Plan Program, and Base Comprehensive Plans.  These efforts include the development of Housing Requirements and Market Analyses (HRMAs), Housing Community Profiles (HCPs), Family Housing Master Plans (FHMPs), General Officer Quarters Master Plans and Dormitory Master Plans (DMPs).
  A full range of environmental and traditional services to include support necessary for the implementation of restoration, quality (pollution prevention and compliance) and conservation environmental projects.  These efforts include planning and programming, program management, scoping, studies, risk assessments, operations support (including data gathering and permit preparation), investigations (including geophysical), evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.  Also included are other related services for the continuation of an existing environmental program or to establish an initial environmental program.  

These resulting contracts are the follow-on to the existing AFCEE A&E services contracts known as 4P A-E.  A-E selection procedures will be used to competitively award approximately twenty five (25) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Approximately fifteen (15) of these contracts may be awarded as full and open competition.  Approximately eight (8) of these contracts may be awarded as competitive small business set-asides.  Approximately one (1) to three (3) of these contracts may be awarded as competitive 8(a) set-asides.  Approximately one (1) of these contracts may be awarded as competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.  AFCEE reserves the right to adjust total awards based on the quality and quantity of proposals received.  Based on historical usage rates, as well as projected needs, this requirement will have an estimated program ceiling of $3B.  The total dollar value of all orders placed on all contracts awarded will not exceed the total program ceiling.  The dollar amount of orders placed on any one contract cannot be determined in advance.  There is a minimum order amount guarantee of $2,500 per contract, which will be issued at contract award.

Statement of Work (SOW) A –applicable to the full and open, 8(a), and SDVOSB set-aside awards for A-E services to support Environmental, MILCON, MFH, and SRM programs of interest to the government.

A small business, 8(a), or SDVOSB may compete under more than one category only if clearly stated in cover letter.  All prime offerors shall submit only one proposal regardless of choice of competition.  Each proposal shall be evaluated only one time.  Points earned for MFH and MILCON criteria 1 “Specialized Experience” under the full and competition level (f) and (g) shall be removed from the small business scores when competing in the small business set aside.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION : 

The US POSTAL SERVICE is currently seeking information on available technology and supply sources in the area of mail processing equipment that can provide products that function to the general specifications described in this notice.  The US POSTAL SERVICE is seeking to deploy an equipment - Postage Due Automation (PDA), that will automate the manual weighing, counting and reporting of various types of postage due mail.  Automating the manual and very labor intensive postage due mail operation shall result in work hour savings nationwide.  


The intent of this notice is to gather product information from current technology sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  Information gathered through this announcement may be used to pre-qualify suppliers for a potential competitive product evaluation at the US POSTAL SERVICE and an opportunity to submit a proposal for this solution.


The system description with performance data submission is to be provided to Mr. Tom Raspet, Contracting Officer, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7803 thomas.m.raspet@usps.gov    Requirements Specification Postage Due Automation (PDA) Program.

BACKGROUND :


Many business mailers subscribe to the Postal Service Business Reply Mail (BRM) service, wherein postage due mail in the form of BRM letters and flats are sent back by responding individuals to the BRM subscriber. Sometimes, the weight of the BRM mail piece varies, requiring distribution clerks in Post Offices nationwide to manually weigh and separate each mail piece into weight categories. Each weight category is then manually counted and recorded to determine the correct postage due for that type of mail. That postage due is charged to the business mailer account subscribing to the BRM service.  


Another scenario in processing BRM is when the mail pieces weigh the same.  In this case, the activities of the distribution clerk are limited to manually counting each mail piece and calculating the postage due on the total piece count for that mail type.
  

The Postal Service is looking for an automated process that will eliminate and/or reduce the time associated with the individual manual weighing, counting and reporting of mail pieces for postage due mail and any other type of mail that may fit similar processing requirements (e.g. address correction).
 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS : 


An acceptable PDA system shall be a simple, one operator, single-pass, and small footprint machine that performs many functions (including weighing, counting, reporting and data archiving), and is able to process mail up to 3/8 inch or better in thickness and up to 13 ounces or better in weight. The spaces available at Post Offices for the PDA system is 84 inches long, 24 inches high and 36 inches deep; the system shall be able rest and operate on top of regularly built table(s) of those dimensions.
   

The system shall be self feeding, rather than having an operator feed one piece at a time. Its in line scale shall be capable of operating in at least 3 modes: a) weigh and count all mail pieces as they move across the scale; b) weigh only the first piece and count subsequent pieces that weigh the same; and c) only count mail pieces without weighing.  The system shall be able to visually tag counted mail in order to identify non-counted mail to the operator. The system shall have a minimum throughput of 100 pieces per minute.  Jam rate should be less than 0.5%.


The system shall be configurable allowing data inputs of the following: rates for each mail type and customer account profile (up to 50 accounts).  The system shall be able to send data to a report module, processed pieces and postage due amounts, by each customer account, by mail type, by weight, and by rate category.  The system shall have data security features categorizing user access.  The system shall be able to store data for at least 90 days.  The system shall have flexible features to allow future capabilities to transmit data to other systems as well as interface with other systems.


SCHEDULE & DELIVERABLES : 


For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide PDA system descriptions with performance data for US POSTAL SERVICE review. This information shall include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor's ability to meet the technical requirements.  This written information shall be delivered to Mr. Tom Raspet (address noted above) no later than March 30, 2007.  Minor variations to the values expressed within the above technical requirements will be considered by the US POSTAL SERVICE if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications.  A question and answer (Q&A) period is designated between March 12 through March 23, 2007.  All supplier questions must be received by March 16, 2007.  The Postal Service will provide official responses by March 23, 2007.


US POSTAL SERVICE prefers to deal with companies that have existing equipment which is available for demonstration and testing purposes.


Following US POSTAL SERVICE review of the submitted PDA system descriptions with performance data, a pre-qualification determination will be made and if appropriate, competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished.  The pre-qualified suppliers will be firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards.
  

The US POSTAL SERVICE will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements.  Interested parties shall submit a total of five copies (three hard copy and two soft data copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs, technology performance specifications, and operations manuals of equipment that meet or exceed these specifications and requirements to the address provided in this announcement.  Overly elaborate responses are neither expected nor required.  The US POSTAL SERVICE by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to the acquisition of any PDA system technology.

SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENT FOR EVALUATION/SELECTION:   (1) Provide proof of the Small Business Administration?s (SBA?s) 8(a), Hub Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned  Small Business (SDVOSB) Certification; (2) Registration in the Department of Defense?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; (3) Any applicable licenses; (4) Letter from the Offeror?s surety stating Offeror?s bonding limitations and capability to perform service work under the NAICS Codes 562212 & 562111; (5) Provide up to three references of completed service projects within the last three years that reflect your firm?s performance and qualifications similar in size,  general scope and complexity to the requirements listed (Recycling Tonnage:  1300 tons of paper and cardboard per year, 180-200 tons of metal, 300 pounds of cans, 1 ton of plastic and 25-30 tons of pallets).  Submittals are due by 28 November 2006, no later than 2:00 P.M. Central Standard Time.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-West, Great Lakes, IL is seeking interest from 8a firms, Hub Zone and/or SDVOSB concerns.  The Government reserves the right to go unrestricted if unable to obtain adequate competition among these specific small business groups.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-West, is currently seeking potential sources for a combination firm fixed price (FFP) and indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a base period of twelve months and four (4) one-year option periods. No single option period will exceed 12 months or one year.  The Contracting Officer, when awarded on a best-value basis, will consider factors such as price and past performance.  The specific work includes refuse/waste collection and disposal at non-residential facilities, remove and dispose of medical waste in accordance with all Federal, State and Local regulation and provide a secure disposal site (off Government property) for the disposal of solid waste, grease waste, asbestos, white goods and a composting facility for landscape waste that was collected and hauled from NTC Great Lakes Naval Complex 3 at Great Lakes and installations in Northeastern, IL by a combination of a  Firm-Fixed Price and Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.

1.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, management, tools, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation, incidental engineering, and other items required to provide services for both refuse collection and recycling as described in thee Performance of Work Statement (PWS) at Naval Station, Great Lakes, and IL.  The services to be performed shall include, but not limited to, collection and disposal of solid waste, resulting from residential, industrial, commercial and community activities; removal, collection, processing and marketing of recyclable material, as well as report tonnage spent for recycling;  and collection and composting of landscape waste.  White Goods (such as refrigerators, freezers, ranges, washers, dryers, etc.) are included in this specification, the collection, processing and disposal will be ordered under Indefinite Quantity Spec Item 4 (EMALL).  These operations shall be performed in accordance with Section H or on a task order in accordance with the Procedures for issuing orders clause in Section G.

2.  The contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, tools, material, transportation and equipment and materials (including a ladder for access to trailers) required to perform refuse collection, disposal and recycling; to manage and dispose of Medical Waste; and to secure a site for the disposal of Landfill Waste (25 mile radius of installation) such as grease waste, asbestos waste, white goods, to include a composting facility for landscape waste collected and hauled from Naval Station Great Lakes, by Government Vehicles.  The bidder who is awarded the contract shall have access to landfills and/or transfer stations that ?ARE NOT? legally prohibited from accepting the refuse requirements of this contract, which are gathered from the state of Illinois.  The state of Wisconsin has imposed legal restrictions on the disposal of Illinois solid waste.  Therefore, disposal sites located in Wisconsin cannot be utilized for disposal of Illinois solid waste during the base period and all option periods.  Although some aspects of these restrictions were invalidated by the seventh circuit court of appeals in 1995, the court suggested a means by which restrictions could be imposed so that it is not clear whether Illinois waste can be accepted for disposal in Wisconsin.

The Small Business Size Standard is $11,500,000.00.  Best Value Source selection procedures will be utilized in conducting this competitive negotiation, which will consist of the submission of price and technical proposals once the Request for proposal is issued.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH A SOLICITATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES. 

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation (ASL) is responsible for the development and implementation of the Department of Health and Human Service’s (HHS) legislative agenda.  It provides advice on legislation and facilitates communication between HHS and Congress.  The office also informs Congress of HHS’ views, priorities, actions, grants and contracts.  ASL is the HHS liaison with members of Congress, staff, Committees, and with the Government Accountability Office (GAO).  The ASL responds to Congressional inquiries about grant awards; notifies Congressional offices of grant awards made by HHS; and facilitates technical assistance regarding grants to members of Congress and their staff. 

The ASL currently uses workflow software to notify Congressional offices when a grant has been approved but has not yet been released.  ASL is in need of workflow software that can meet its need with greater accuracy and efficiency.

The objective is a responsive and cost-effective support to deliver a robust web-based system for all grant tracking and notification activities, including identifying the congressional district of the grant award recipient, reporting and maintaining the grants database records, and tracking grants as they go through the review and clearance process up to and including easy and quick electronic notification of grant awards to Congressional offices.   

The solution needs to accommodate the following requirements and an off-the-shelf product or an off-the-shelf product with a small amount of customization is desired:

1.	More than one user at a time should be able to use the system at once.
2.	A minimum of 2 users will be utilizing the system at all times and that number could increase to 10 depending on the cost of allowing that many users.
3.	Must be able to use data in existing format from multiple operating divisions.  Currently, data is sent in notepad via email using either the IMPACT2 or GATES systems.
4.	Data shall easily be converted into a template notice that includes the HHS letterhead or logo for Congressional offices with minimum or no manual input required from the user.
5.	Grants shall automatically be matched to the correct Representatives and Senators using the address and zip code of the grantee.
6.	Congressional information should be drawn from an up-to-date database of Representatives and Senators and contact information should also include information on their staff.
7.	If any data from the operating divisions cannot be assigned to the corresponding template or to a Representative or Senator, there must be an alert message or error message for the user.
8.	If an emailed grant alert notice does not go through to the email recipient for any reason, the user should be able to print and fax the notice.
9.	The users should be able to import data in large batches and send notices in batches.  In 2005 the Congressional Liaison Office sent out almost 600,000 individual grant notices.  
10.	Each day’s worth of grant notices should be easily printable.
11.	Data should be retained for no more than 2 years and data older than 2 years should be automatically purged.
12.	All data in the current system utilized by HHS should be imported into the new system to provide continuity.
13.	The system shall be tested by the users for a period of time acceptable to the vendor and the users to troubleshoot any problems.
14.	Training for the user and technical support needs to be available for the users.

INTERESTED SOURCES POSSESSING THE REQUIRED CAPABILITIES TO MEET THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD SUBMIT A COVER LETTER ALONG WITH A CAPABILITY STATEMENT NOT TO EXCEED 15 PAGES DEMONSTRATING ABILITY TO PERFORM.  

Responses must include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business (whether large or small).  If a small business concern, whether they are a small disadvantaged, women owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned, 8(a), or an 8(a) HUBZone.  Additional documentation such as company literature and brochures may be included.  If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. A mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements must be submitted via email to clint.druk@psc.gov.  No statements delivered by mail, fax, or by hand shall be accepted under any circumstances.  Responses are due no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time, April 13, 2007.

<DESC>Mine Emergency Operations
Specifications 
Rapid Deploy Seismic Location System (RDSLS)

The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) an agency of the United States Department of Labor possesses a Seismic Location System for search and rescue of trapped miners that has been used for about 35 years.  The system is truck mounted and is stationed at MSHA’s Mine Emergency Operations (MEO) facilities located in Bruceton, Pennsylvania.  The fact that it is integrated to its truck mountings somewhat limits it rapid deployment to either the mine site or location chosen for set-up, especially if the location is not accessible by road.  While functional, the current system is based upon very dated technology and spare parts for some of the equipment have been discontinued by their manufacturers.  New signal processing electronics that now exist and the greatly increased speed of today’s computers allow MSHA to develop an updated system with vastly greater capabilities.  Further, the development of new signal processing algorithms has expanded as the technology to support them has made their application practical.  Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) capabilities would also be designed to link between the geophone subsystems and the present base station.  

MSHA Is seeking an easily transportable Rapid Deploy Seismic Location System for use in mine emergencies that can be quickly set up to provide emergency service.  This system will be used to detect and located the source of  signals transmitted by trapped miners.  At this time, MSHA is not interested in a developmental effort and is seeking information on and sources for a complete system that meets the following specifications:

The Rapid Deploy Seismic Location System (RDSLS) shall consist of the following components and features:
I. Seismic Equipment to listen for and interpret the distinct tapping sounds generated by miners tapping on the installed bolts in the roof of the mine entries. The system shall be designed to be very portable and easily and rapidly transported and deployed quickly in emergency situations. 

A.	The first hours of entrapment are very critical and having equipment on site and deployed quickly is imperative to locating miners in order to facilitate rescue methods.
B.	The RDSLS shall include an array of listening devices to cover a large distance over sometimes extensive mine works where miners may be trapped in unknown different areas of the mine. MSHA currently uses 7 subarrays, each with 7 geophones. 
C.	The RDSLS shall include an array of transmitter devices to send the collected signals by a wireless means to a small base station computer located in a mobile vehicle. The transmitter shall be designed similar to or as an improvement to the present MSHA telemetry transmitters, which use tripod mounted antennae. The RDSLS shall be designed to work and be deployed over all types of terrain and in all types of weather conditions. The system shall be capable of receiving signals from the transmitters. If signal repeaters are designed for the system the repeaters shall be proven to operate under all scenarios. 
D.	The RDSLS shall convert to digital format as early as possible in the gathering and transmission process. 
E.	The RDSLS shall include a portable central receiver to collect the signals from the array of transmitters. The signals shall be stored in a database for processing and micro seismic search. The database shall be made available to other processors or laptop computers. This information could be made available by use of a local area network. The laptops shall be equipped with analysis software that allows them to cancel certain seismic noise and vibration interference and detect the tapping of the miners. The software shall enhance the seismic signals by removing distortion and reverberation. The system shall be designed for the transmission of seismic signal data using the internet. The non-receipt of signals from some of the transmitters shall not cause a delay in the analysis of data received from the transmitters that are functioning. 
F.	A system control screen shall be a part of the RDSLS. The screen shall have displays that show full system status including array status, location information, time, storage information, electrical information and control status. 
G.	The RDSLS shall have the capability to identify, isolate and ignore or cancel random noise interference and simultaneously operate in locating miners tapping. 
H.	The manufacturer shall develop and incorporate algorithms that search in real time and determine when the miners are tapping and also search in space to determine the location of the signals. 
I.	The RDSLS shall include a locater that identifies the coordinates of the tapping sounds and is capable of interfacing with the underground mine coordinate and mapping systems and providing mine locations of the trapped miners. The system shall be capable of identifying the location to within 1-2 meters. 
J.	Current base station hardware used by MSHA shall be reviewed and any or all hardware shall be used wherever possible to define new signal processing components such as noise cancellation that the new system lacks.
K.	Listening devices or geophones, preamplifiers, and the Base station shall be designed to consume a minimum of power to reduce the size of batteries. Properly sized and designed batteries shall be provided. Backup batteries and charging racks shall also be provided. All batteries shall be case mounted. 
L.	The battery power shall be designed to operate during one search mission without battery replacement. The search mission may last a minimum of 7 days. 
M.	A properly sized generator shall be provided for situations where commercial power is not available including capability to recharge system batteries while system is in operation. 
N.	The RDSLS shall incorporate GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) receivers in the geophone subarrays for location detection to within a meter. The RDSLS shall be designed to work and be deployed over all types of terrain and in all types of weather conditions. The system shall be capable of receiving signals from the transmitters. In the event the transmitters cannot receive GPS signals, the manual survey of locations may be necessary. The RDSLS must be capable of easily incorporating manual survey data into the computer operating systems without delaying the location analysis procedures.   
O.	The signals will be relatively weak. The miners are trained to pound on the roof ten times with approximately 1 second between each strike. This process is repeated every 15 minutes. This is the sound that must be detected with the consideration and filtering of other machine, wind, equipment and other noises. 
P.	The miners may be located as far as 2000 feet below the surface. 
Q.	The system shall be fully automated i.e. all procedures for listening for the tapping signals, isolating with filtering, transmitting, receiving, analyzing and a resultant display of locations must eliminate the current system method of manual examination of waveforms for detecting signals. 
R.	The RDSLS shall utilize a Windows XP operating system. 

.

II. The RDSLS shall be designed for future component change or system upgrade without disrupting the total system integrity or operating characteristics. 
A.	The system being purchased is to replace an existing system that is dated and not easily updated. The new system shall be designed to easily accept future updates to software or improved additions to hardware without disruption or the need to replace total system hardware. 
B.  The RDSLS shall be designed with redundancy i.e. the system is used in remote areas and backup systems must be integral to the RDSLS.  Critical spare parts must be provided with the system and a list of other recommended spare parts shall be provided. 
III. The equipment shall include a mobile all wheel drive vehicle that is capable of transporting the equipment from the Mine Emergency Operations Center in a rapid deployment mode.
A.	The mobile vehicle shall be designed to transport equipment but the RDSLS equipment may be required to be transported by air to a location not quickly accessed by driving. The RDSLS shall be capable of being packed in suitcases or small shipping containers in either land or air deployment. The weights shall not exceed 30 pounds per case to allow for one person to carry each case. 
B.	The mobile equipment rear compartment shall be designed for bench seating and for lock down of the encased portable equipment for transportation. 
C.	The RDSLS equipment shall be encased in weather proof boxes to withstand all types of extreme elements. The equipment should be cushioned to support any vibration and movement experienced during rugged terrain transportation and use. 
D.	The Base Station shall be designed to work in either the mobile vehicle or in a building or tent if deployed by air.
E.	Racks shall be designed and provided for all equipment for temporary storage and transportation. 
F.	The vehicle shall be a ¾ ton chassis design, 4 wheel drive with a rear compartment that is air conditioned/heated. 
G.	The vehicle shall have an antennae attached that can be manually extended or telescoped to attain higher limits for improved reception of transmitted signals from the arrays. 
H.	The vehicle shall be low profile to allow shipping by air as per US Air Force specifications. 

IV. The RDSLS will require calibration to analyze the signals for the varying types of regional geology or strata types prior to beginning the effort to listen for miners signals. This calibration will determine the relative speed of sound through the given rock formation.  
A.   Calibration may be required using refractive or reflective geophysical methods. The RDSLS shall be designed to complete the calibration quickly utilizing the RDSLS geophone arrays and base station equipment. 
B.  The RDLS shall be designed to select specific regional geology background as an alternative to performing the calibration procedure. This alternative will allow for quicker start up in the search for miners. 

V.. Other desirable system characteristics.
A.	Interactive method to manipulate data to identify signals of interest for viewing, filtering and selecting 
B.	Automate and highly interactive processing (first arrival picking, filtering, locating) with display of location results, including uncertainty, on the mine map. 
C.	Streaming of raw data and triggered events of interest to off site expert analysis via satellite.
D.	Simultaneous display of long time continuous records (unfiltered and filtered) from all array stations. 
E.	System shall work in both a triggered (following 3 surface fired shots or upon detection of strong signals) and in a continuous mode.
F.	Signals need to have a high signal to noise ratio.
G.	System capabilities should include the coordinate systems be imputed well ahead of time before the situation is in a search mode. The system shall be capable of converting each mine’s local coordinate system to state plane and to GPS and vice versa.
H.	The arrival times at subarrays shall be ascertained and the system shall determine location by calculating signals and arrival times.
I.	The system shall be capable of filtering noise at or near a mine site that is not feasible to be shut off. Examples of this include high voltage power lines from nearby power plants, surface or buried pipelines that may be carrying water, gas products or other gasses or liquids, or nearby traffic on highly traveled public roads.

<DESC>NOTE:  The information contained in this sources sought notice is the same as the one published at FedBizOpps on 20 February 2007 (Reference # Sources-Sought-Notice-for-HH65-Auto-Pilot-System).  This sources sought notice is being republished to allow the industry more time to prepare and submit responses.  

This is not a request for proposals. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

The Coast Guard is looking for sources/vendors capable of providing a replacement for the HH-65 Auto Pilot system.  This solicitation has been issued to survey the market to identify suitable candidate systems for consideration.  The H-65 avionics system modernization plan includes the incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) now being installed in the Coast Guard H-60 aircraft. Current H-65 autopilot system specifications are attached for review.  The Coast Guard is seeking an autopilot system that meets or exceeds the current system capabilities. Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the attached documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC?s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC?s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.     After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FEDBIZOPS. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.     Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met.   Telephone responses will not be accepted.     Responses must be received no later than 27 February 2007 at 3 p.m. EST.     This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.     All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.     All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.     Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

Point of Contact

The Coast Guard is publishing this request for information and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the following address no later than 11 May 2007.  

              HH-65 Product Line Division
  Attn: Tabitha Bakely
              USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
              Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001

Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Tabitha.L.Bakely@uscg.mil  including the following in the subject line “H-65 Autopilot  Comments, Company Name”.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of the avionics modernization plan for the H-65.

Additional Project Details

1.0	Scope
The Autopilot system may be installed in all H-65 aircraft.  The requirement will include spares.  The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard inventory requirements.  Additional systems may be acquired if the H-65 fleet is expanded.  

2.0	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (97) H-65 aircraft.  The fleet is being expanded to 102 aircraft.  The Coast Guard H-60 fleet is in the process of being upgraded by incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  The Coast Guard is seeking to simplify logistics and reduce total engineering development cost by incorporating the CAAS system in the H-65.   

The current H-65 autopilot system is described in the attached documents.  This system has performed extremely well in service.  Unfortunately, the current autopilot system is no longer in production and would require costly modifications to integrate with planned avionics system improvements.  The replacement system must meet or exceed the current system capabilities.  As the respondents review the attachments, careful attention should be directed at the following sections:

	Attachment (1): Avionics System Specification USCG HH-65A Helicopter
		Section 3.1.1.1 	Normal Flight Envelope
		Section 3.3.4 		Flight Control
		Section 3.5 		Design Requirements for Equipment
		Section 3.6		Qualification Requirements
		Section 4.2 		Flight Management Subsystem
		Section 4.3 		Flight Control Subsystem

	Attachment (2):  Flight Control Subsystem Specification USCG HH-65 Helicopter
		Section 3.0 	General Requirements
		Section 4.0	Functional and Operational Requirements
		Section 4.2	Flight Director System (particularly the available modes).

Note:  the attachments, especially the flight control specification, provides a detailed description of the current system.  The modernized system must provide the same functionality, or better.  However, the system architecture may be completely different.

The HH-65 is a derivative of the Eurocopter Dauphin aircraft.  The current configuration is similar to the AS 365N3.  The aircraft was originally built to FAR part 29 standards.  Modifications to the aircraft are designed to current FAR 29 standards with exceptions approved for Coast Guard specific requirements.  

3.0	Modernization Planning

The H-65 avionics systems improvements will replace existing equipment with current available commercial and government-supplied components.  The system will include dual Honeywell HG764/GU Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation systems (EGI) and a HG7210CA01 RADAR Altimeter system (RADALT).  The flight management system will be incorporated in the Collins CDU-7000.

The system will be fully integrated with the flight management system.  The complete system will be capable of full control of all axis of flight from a stable hover to flight and back to a stable hover at a designated position.  

Autopilot mode annunciation will be incorporated into the CAAS display system.  All lighting, displays, controls and indicators will be optimized for viewing with the unaided eye and compatible with aircrew Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.  

For planning purposes, it should be assumed that the autopilot system will be certified under FAR 29.  However, the Coast Guard will work in partnership with NAVAIR for the airworthiness certification.

3.1	Support
A Support By the Hour (SBH) support strategy is desired.  The support structure will be based existing Coast Guard support contracts.  The support strategy will be included in the system procurement process.  

3.2	Open Architecture
The Autopilot will be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols.  The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems.  Data developed at government expense will be used by the government without restriction.

4.	Vendor Qualification
The supplier must be an original equipment manufacturer for autopilot systems.  The supplier must have been approved by the US Department of Defense (DOD) or GSA (or equivalent as determined by the best value source selection team) as an aircraft autopilot supplier or have been included as part of an approved supplemental type certificate for installation of autopilot systems on US commercial aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration.  

The supplier must have experience working with civil and military airworthiness authorities.  The supplier must explain in their response how they would certify the airworthiness of the installation.

The supplier must have or establish a permanent presence in the United States staffed with English speaking technical support personnel.  All system documentation must be available in readily understandable English language format.

5.	Evaluation
After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.

Selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.

The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price.  Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.

The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced.  An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.

This phase of the project will also involve prediction of the noise performance and sensitivity of the magnetic thermometers and microcalorimeters. Involve Graduate Research Assistants or Post-doctoral scholars, when appropriate. This phase of the effort should be completed in Spring of 2007. 

FABRICATION OF MMCS: Most of the fabrication of the devices will be carried out by QSP staff. The sub-contracted team will provide advice or support as necessary throughout the process, and also coordinate fabrication of the paramagnetic sensor thin-films, expected to be the final step in preparing MMC devices for testing. Our goal is to finish device fabrication by April 2007.

4 K TESTING: Initial testing of the devices for noise performance and coupling efficiency will be carried out by the subcontracted team. In order to accomplish this, a 4 K SQUID testing station will be purchased and installed by the subcontractors. The assembly of this station will begin immediately, so that 4 K testing can be complete in April or May of 2007.

LOW TEMPERATURE TESTING: When 4 K testing is complete, Magnetic Calorimeters and Thermometers will be tested at low temperatures. If facilities allow, this testing will be carried out by the subcontractors, otherwise, the QSPs ADR facilities at NIST may be used. If devices offer promise of excellent performance as x-ray detectors, ADR testing at 50 mK will be completed by early summer 2007, so that results may be presented at the 12th International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors in July 2007.  

MAGNETICALLY-DOPED FILM DEVELOPMENT: We require the sub-contracted team to develop and test methods to grow metallic and semiconducting (silicon-based) films doped with magnetic moments. This requires electronbeam evaporation, and some funds will be provided to the sub-contractors team to add this extended deposition capabilities to a film deposition system being designed and built in FY2007. These films will be designed to provide potential improvements in future magnetic thermometer devices.  

DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS: We expect that the subcontracted team will present plans and preliminary results at conferences such as the yearly meetings of the American Physical Society and the Materials Research Society. If the performance of the MMC devices or magnetic thermometers is suitable, results will be presented at LTD12 and submitted for publication in either Applied Physics Letters, Journal of Applied Physics, or Review of Scientific Instruments. If results do not warrant publication as a journal article, a final report on FY2007 activities will be prepared by the subcontracted team submitted the NIST QSP.

1)	Regional Contracts:  What would be the impact of combining multiple country requirements into a regional LGF contract?  (Example - The requirements for several European Union countries combined into one solicitation/contract.)  How would this affect competition, pricing and operations?

In addition to providing a description of the impact in general conceptual terms to a ?regional approach?, please also provide comments, concerns and suggestions regarding a solicitation/contract that specifically covered the following two hypothetical scenarios:

a) Germany (Berlin, Cologne, D?sseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, IBB Holzkrich, IBB Biblis, IBB Lamperthiem, Leipzig and Munich); Luxembourg, Luxembourg and Brussels, Belgium; and 

b) Brazil (Brasilia, Recife, Rio de Janeiro and San Paulo), Bridgetown, Barbados and Belize City, Belize.

In addition, please provide comments regarding a Request for Proposal (RFP) approach that would cover multiple locations/cities/countries and contemplate separate contract awards, for different locations. The goal of such an approach would be to enable contractors (i.e., offerors) to propose on one, some and/or all sites, so that the Government may benefit from an ?economy of scale? savings based on lower prices associated with a larger number of sites.  The Department of States favors this approach over the regional approach addressed above.  

2)	Competition:  The U.S. Department of State larger dollar value LGF contracts are listed below.  Please comment, giving pros and cons, as to your company?s ability to propose on groups of or all of the following locations:

?	Argentina (Buenos Aires)
?	Australia (Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney)
?	Austria (Vienna)
?	Bahamas (Nassau)
?	Belgium (Brussels)
?	Brazil (Brasilia,  Recife, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo)
?	Colombia (Bogot?)
?	Finland (Helsinki)
?	France (Paris,  Marseille and Strasbourg)
?	Germany (Berlin,  Cologne, D?sseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, IBB Holzkrich, IBB Biblis, IBB Lamperthiem, Leipzig and Munich)
?	Greece (Athens and   Thessalonica)
?	India (New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai)
?	Italy (Rome,  Florence and The Vatican)
?	Jamaica (Kingston)
?	Kenya (Nairobi)
?	Korea (Seoul)
?	Mexico (Mexico City,  Ciudad Juarez, Guadalajara, Hermosila, Matamoras, Mazatlan, Merida, Mexicali, Monterrey, Nogales, Nuevo Laredo, Puerto Vallarata and  Tijuana)
?	Morocco (Rabat,  Casablanca and Tangier)
?	Nigeria (Abuja and Lagos)
?	Pakistan (Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore and Karachi)
?	Peru (Lima)
?	Japan (Tokyo, Fukuoka, Nagoya, Naha, Osakra-Kobe and Sapporo)
?	Saudi Arabia (Riyadh,  Dhahran and Jeddah)
?	South Africa (Pretoria,  Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg) 
?	Spain (Madrid and  Barcelona)
?	Uganda (Kampala)
?	United Arab Emirates (Abu Dhabi and  Dubai)
?	United Kingdom (London)

3)	Selection Process:  Please articulate the pros/cons of the Government using a ?Best Value? selection  methodology on any given local guard services procurement if such  an approach was determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Currently all such contracts must be awarded on a low
price, technically acceptable basis. (Please note this is currently a legislative requirement in accordance with 22 U.S.C 4864.)  What evaluation criteria would you find as meaningful differentiators? 

4)	Contract Type:  Are there alternative contract types that would be more cost effective to perform under or administer?  

     5)  Central Contract Award/Administration:  Comment regarding a centralized contracting process where one contracting organization is responsible for soliciting, awarding and administrating all LGF contracts, worldwide, versus the current contracting process where a Contracting Officer at each post solicits, awards and administers the LFG contract.

Please provide a White Paper, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, to:

		U.S. Department of State
		Attn:  James S. (Steve) Rogers, Room 237
		1701 N. Ft. Myer Drive

DO NOT include advertisements or promotional material in support of your company.

6)  Industry Day:  Upon review of all submitted material, the Department of State is contemplating an Industry Day for all contractors within the Security field in order to distribute more information on this effort and have face-to-face discussions with the Security community.  Please indicate whether or not you would be interested in attending this event.

<SUBJECT>B -- Wheeled Mobility Study
<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the U.S. Access Board intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with The Research Foundation of the State University of New York, 35 State Street Albany, New York NY 12207-2826. 

This project will complete the work on space requirements, horizontal and vertical maneuvering parameters, reach ranges, and other key factors of occupied manual and power wheelchairs and scooters first awarded to the Research Foundation of the State University of New York in FY 2002. The addition of 200 human subject research files from other locations is required to ensure a representative sample.  Data on three hundred individuals who use wheeled mobility devices have been gathered by the Research Foundation and entered into a proprietary database developed as one deliverable of that project, which was terminated in FY 2006 for the convenience of the government when its remaining funding wasn’t sufficient to cover the needed work.
 
The Contractor will supervise data-gathering at the University of Pittsburgh (funded under a separate FY 2006 award) and at a second center, as yet unidentified (which will also be funded separately, from FY 2007 monies).  The Contractor will supervise staff training in measurement protocols, add the data gathered to its extensive database, analyze the full data record, and report findings and recommendations to the Board.  
 
No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by April 3, 2007. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>99 -- United States Mint BAU A-76 Announcement
<DESC>The primary mission of the United States Mint is to mint and issue circulating coins to meet the needs of the United States.  To meet this mission more efficiently, the United States Mint was preparing to conduct a public-private competition to determine whether procuring ready-to-coin blanks (planchets) to produce the five-cent, dime, quarter-dollar, half-dollar and one-dollar circulating coinage would be more cost-effective than procuring base metal strip for the production of planchets in house.  The Department of the Treasury, after careful consideration of all factors, has decided to cancel the public-private competition under solicitation #USM-HQ-05-066.  The rationale for this action is that business conditions have changed significantly since the initial planning for the competition.  Metal prices have increased considerably over the last three years and the production of the Presidential $1 Coin has caused substantial changes to the production environment.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the mission of the United States Mint to cancel the proposed public-private competition.

C.5  The Contractor shall institute an animal health program that will ensure delivery of healthy animals to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  This program will include, at a minimum, vaccination for Shipping Fever Pneumonia Complex no later than the beginning of the fourteen (14) day quarantine period.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a six (6) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-03-D-0027 for husbanding services with Jamaica in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional North and South American husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a seven (7) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-03-D-0034 for husbanding services with Bermuda in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional North and South American husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

<DESC>Based on received questions and answers, RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111 has been restated as follows:

SECTION B – SUPPLIES/SERVICES AND PRICES:  

Section B has been revised to indicate changes in CLINs  0008, 0009, 0012, 0013, 0016  and 0017.  Please request the revised Section B via e-mail to millerd@sec.gov.

SECTION C – DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK:  

Section C, Paragraph C.2.9 has been changed to read:  “The CDC is seeking a LEED-CI Silver Rating and the items identified in the Attachment (1) Product Data Catalog, to the extent available, have been identified as meeting LEED requirements, therefore the contractor shall ensure that the exact item (make, model, etc.) is purchased.  Any exceptions or substitutions shall be submitted per the instructions contained in paragraph C.2.3.  The criteria specified below and in Attachment (2) Section 018113 – Sustainable Design Requirements is provided for your information:”
 
SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Verbiage has been added to Section H as follows:

H.15  Wage Rates by Location

Prevailing wage rates will be incorporated by individual task order.  

SECTION I – CONTRACT CLAUSES

The following clause has been invoked by checking with an “X”:
_X_ (1) 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended (Jul 2005)(41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.).

ld not be able to accept a price for these line items after contract award.

Question 10:  We cannot identify any specifications for these items (Commission wide program Items 0006 through 0017) within the document we have received.  What is the SEC looking for in a response?  Even though “teaming” is an acceptable process with a wide variety of manufacturers, not every manufacturer is willing to participate or offer appropriate credit terms to facilitate a program.

Response:   As stated in Section C.3, requirements for the Commision wide program will be defined in individual task orders.  Each task order will define the type of furniture desired (e.g. desks, chairs, fax machines, copiers) the quantity, destination office, etc.  The task order will also provide the funding to the contractor to purchase the desired items.  The SEC anticipates that the contractor will then seek quotes from a variety of manufacturers and award a purchase order, including full funding, to the one meeting the criteria under the most favorable terms (description, price, delivery).

Question 11:  The list under CLINS 0008, 0012, 0016 for delivery and installation will vary by each location depending on the labor market.  In addition, these prices vary due to loading dock and elevator issues, permits, security, and time of day or weekend work.  To provide hourly rates in each market is possible but will take some time to get that documentation and then will have to presented market-by-market.

Response:  The SEC has revised Section B, CLINS 0008, 0009, 0012, 0013, 0016, and 0017 to request pricing per each office location and has been marked TBD (to be determined) so the contractor can obtain a realistic quote under individually issued task orders.

Question 12:  The same issue for Storage as was noted previously for Washington, DC but again, each market will be different as noted above.  How should we proceed?

Response:  See response to question 11 above.





Question 13:  Can an offer be made for one of the two programs or must a bidder respond to both parts?

Response:  The SEC issued amendment 03, posted to FEDBIZOps on March 15, 2007, which allows offerors the opportunity to quote on either one or the other program or both, if desired.

Question 14:  What is the method for award?  How will the offers be evaluated?  We note that invoicing for services on the CDC portion cannot occur to after September 10 whereas the installation is to be complete by August 17.  Why the delay?

Response:  Please see section M of the solicitation for the method of award and evaluation criteria.  The only item where invoices cannot be submitted for payment until after the entire project is completed is CLIN 0002, the administration fee.   Invoices for all other CLINS can be submitted as the project progresses. 

Question 15:   How do we provide evidence of paid invoices when many of the items listed for the CDC will be paid by credit card?  Are those receipts acceptable?  What required documentation for invoices paid by check? Copies of cancelled checks with bank processes of today can be an administrative nightmare – but a copy check that has been issued is very feasible.

Response:  Yes receipts for credit card purchases are acceptable.  Copies of cancelled checks are not required.  An invoice from the manufacturer stating that it has been paid in full is acceptable evidence.

Question 16:  We suggest that a pre-bid meeting for all bidders be held so all are working with the same criteria.

Response:  A proposal conference has been scheduled for Wednesday, March 28, 2007 at 1:00 p.m. at the SEC’s Headquarters Office (Station Place), 101 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C.  20549.  The conference will be held in room #3000, 3rd floor.  Interested bidders wishing to participate in the conference should call or e-mail the point of contact, Debbie Miller (202) 551-8254/millerd@sec.gov. 

Question 17:  We formally request a delay in the due date and that 10 working days after all amendments are issued be allowed for preparing a response.

Response:  The SEC has provided a valid, clearly written Request for Proposal for this effort.  However, we have received substantial questions that we would like to be addressed in the proposal response.  The SEC will extend the due date for this RFP to NLT 4:30 p.m. EST, Monday, April 9, 2007.

<DESC>03-23-07,  4:15 p.m.  Response to questions submitted for RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111:
Questions 18 – 25

Please note:  Questions 1 through 5 have been asked and responded to via Amendment 4 on FEDBIZOPS.   Questions 6 – 17 have been answered via Amendment 5 on FEDBIZOPS. Questions 18 – 26  will be answered via Amendment 7 on FEDBIZOPS.  These questions are numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions asked and answered for this particular RFP.


Question 18:  Item number 0005:  Are the additional fees for delay in delivery based on daily or a monthly schedules?  The format on page 2 appears to default on 30 days (i.e., additional days are billed at a minimum of 1 month) but the H.8 reference stipulates daily billing.  In either case, will the SEC clarify the billing basis for all bidders (s.f., weight, item count....).  For our purposes, the procedure for measuring storage would also need to be clarified once they define the rate basis.

Response:  The SEC requests a daily rate for this line item.  We anticipate that the storage requirement for the CDC would not exceed a total of 30 days.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A REVISED ANSWER FROM QUESTION NUMBER 9.  Further discussion allowed for a change in our thinking.  ITEM NUMBER 0005 WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DAILY RATE.

Question 19:  administration.  For the base period and option periods, you are requesting a lot price for administration.  Since the level of effort can vary significantly dependent upon the number and size of each task order, please provide the parameters that should be used in determining the lot price.

Response:  For line item 0002, administrative fee for the CDC shall be proposed as one lot and is a firm requirement.  Offerors should propose their fee for this task from contract award through final completion of all deliverables.  For the Commission wide administrative fee line items for the SEC furniture, Offerors should propose a percentage of the funding as their administrative fee

Question 20:  assembly and delivery.  For the base period and option periods, is it acceptable to submit labor categories and their respective labor rates?

Response:  The SEC will revise these items to be priced once firm requirements are known and a task order issued.

Question 21:  storage fee.   For the base period and options, is it acceptable to submit the storage fee per day per space or shipping weight of items?

Response:  The SEC will revise these items to a price per sf, to be priced once firm requirements are known and a task order issued. (See Amendment #6 in FEDBIZOPS).

Question 22:  Replacement or Upgraded Furniture.  Since there is no mention about relocating existing furniture, shall we assume that areas receiving this furniture are empty and are ready for installation?

Response:  Yes.

Question 23:   Clarify the intention of product verification into and out of the warehouse should be clarified in terms of item verification.  Typically bulk freight is received from the shipper/manufacturer, then we verify the item descriptions and quantities listed on the purchasing docs/bill of lading.  This does not usually include unwrapping the individual items unless there is clear physical damage to the outside of the packing materials/container. If there is damage, we note the damages and alert our clients immediately.  The main argument for leaving packaging intact on items (provided we're able to verify item description and quantity through the wrap) is to keep the items clean while in storage.  Additionally, leaving the packaging intact will greatly reduce handling damages during redelivery.  If we are required to completely remove packaging, we will then need to factor in additional packing costs for redelivery.

Response:  The SEC has several concerns with this proposed process: 1) if the items are stored for several months unopened and unassembled, then opened and assembled on-site and there are missing parts, wrong item shipped, item is damaged or broken, or any other issue that would then cause a last minute scramble to obtain a replacement piece.  2) the CDC will have a brand new rubber floor and we are unwilling to risk damage to this floor through furniture and equipment assembly.  3)  Items such as cribs, tricycles, baby buggies, chairs, desks, can and should be assembled off-site.  Very large or cumbersome items, such as the play loft could be assembled on-site and the SEC is willing to consider this on a case-by-case basis subject to coordination with the SEC, the construction contractor and the architect.  It is of utmost importance that the CDC be ready for operation by the appointed time.  

Question 24:  Clarify if the national deliveries be performed on weekday, weeknight, weekend, or possibly holiday schedules.

Response:  This will be specified on individual task orders and the contractor shall provide a price based on those unique requirements when the task order is issued.

Question 25:  Confirm the quantity of 0 on the 'SEC FFE Sched.xls'document, Item P20.

Response:  The quantity for this item should be 1 each.

<DESC>03-23-07,  1:40 p.m.  Response to questions submitted for RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111:
Questions 6 – 17

Please note:  Questions 1 through 5 have been asked and responded to via Amendment 4 on FEDBIZOPS.  These questions are numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions asked and answered for this particular RFP.

Question 6:  The spreadsheet developed by SKB appears twice; once as an eleven (11) page document and again as a thirteen (13) page document.  They appear to be similar, if not identical.  Please clarify.

Response:  Yes, they are identical.  The 11 page document is in PDF format.  The 13 page document is an Excel Spreadsheet.

Question 7:  The requirement for LEED CI information plus sustainability documentation is well documented.  However, since the specifications are to be held as to manufacturer and product as well as finish/fabrics, etc. how should one respond when that respective manufacturer cannot, or will not, provide any documentation?  Many of the items for the CDC, such as diaper changing pads, boombox, air purifier, etc., will probably have no information nor any need to have sustainability information.  Many of the vendors listed (Toys R Us, Staples, Best Buy) have equipped to provide this kind of documentation, even should it exist, for simple sales.  Should we only be accountable for those manufacturers who have the information and will provide it?

Response:  Paragraph C.2.9 will be changed to read:  “The CDC is seeking a LEED-CI Silver Rating and the items identified in the Attachment (1) Product Data Catalog, to the extent available, have been identified as meeting LEED requirements, therefore the contractor shall ensure that the exact item (make, model, etc.) is purchased.  Any exceptions or substitutions shall be submitted per the instructions contained in paragraph C.2.3.  The criteria specified below and in Attachment (2) Section 018113 – Sustainable Design Requirements is provided for your information:”

Question 8:  In Section C.2.5, Assembly …, the requirement is for items to be assembled in our premises (Distribution Center) and then transported to the site.  It is our experience that less damage and a more efficient installation occurs when we deliver and then un-carton, assemble, and distribute within the site.  At that point, all trash, packing material, etc. is removed and recycled if appropriate.  Will the SEC accept that process?

Response:  The SEC has several concerns with this proposed process: 1) if the items are stored for several months unopened and unassembled, then opened and assembled on-site and there are missing parts, wrong item shipped, item is damaged or broken, or any other issue that would then cause a last minute scramble to obtain a replacement piece.  2) the CDC will have a brand new rubber floor and we are unwilling to risk damage to this floor through furniture and equipment assembly.  3)  Items such as cribs, tricycles, baby buggies, chairs, desks, can and should be assembled off-site.  Very large or cumbersome items, such as the play loft could be assembled on-site and the SEC is willing to consider this on a case-by-case basis subject to coordination with the SEC, the construction contractor and the architect.  It is of utmost importance that the CDC be ready for operation by the appointed time.  

Question 9:  In Section B.1, CLIN 0005, Storage Fee.  Our CFMS contract is based on pricing storage by the square foot.  It is difficult to determine what that requirement may be for the CDC and can only be determined after receipt of the goods.  Is there a provision that can be added where we provide the square-foot cost with the amount of square feet to be determined and agreed upon?

Response:  Line Items 0005, 0009, 0013 and 0017 qty/unit will be changed to square foot rather than a daily rate.  The contractor should estimate the amount of square feet need based on the items to be purchased under the Attachment (1) Product Data Catalog.  We wou
