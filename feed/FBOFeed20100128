<DESC>The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to issue a modification to the 8-month letter contract, FA8088-10-C-0002, to acquire additional Milstar and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS III) satellite operations and logistics sustainment support. The additional 4-years and 4-months of effort will provide for continued satellite-sustaining maintenance engineering in support of satellite health and safety, and system and mission operations. This is a continuation of effort to the existing Milstar and DSCS Orbital Operations Support (OOS) and MILSATCOM Logistics Sustainment Support (MLSS) contracts currently performed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, 111 Lockheed Martin Way, Bldg 157, Sunnyvale, CA 94089.
<p>MCSW intends to award this contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2). Award to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Based on an evaluation of Statements of Capability submitted in response to the sources sought notice issued on 30 Jun 2008 for this effort, MCSW concluded that only the incumbent, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), possesses both the capability and experience necessary to effectively provide Milstar and DSCS operations and logistics sustainment support. LMSSC was the only contractor with demonstrated Milstar and DSCS III satellite and ground system logistics capability, past program experience, and knowledge to perform the required software, hardware, and system/anomaly analyses; system design, maintenance, integration and test; and individual spacecraft configurations, orbital operations and procedures.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Capabilities information may be emailed to: tracy.stroud@losangeles.af.mil. Responses from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.</p>

<DESC>The Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) intends to issue a solicitation prior to October 1, 2010 for multiple award Indefinite Delivery contracts to lease multifunction devices though out South Korea for a base year with options for three additional years.  The lease terms will be for 48-months on an option type delivery order. The pricing in effect at the time of the issuance of the delivery order will prevail for the term of the lease. All maintenance, copies, and consumable supplies with the exception of staples and paper are to be supplied as part of the lease price.  The base period minimum has not been established however historical records indicate placing approximately 270 devices within the first year throughout South Korea. 

The maximum estimate for the base and all option periods is $38 million USD. This figure is only a possibility as the U.S. Government only has to award the guaranteed minimum which has yet to be established.

Devices will be ordered by volume bands.  All devices will be network, fax, print, and scan capable.  The only deviation is for devices that will be used for classified materials. These devices will require a removable hard drive. Presently the six volume bands are:

	- VB0:  Minimum 15 copies per minute, 600 dpi or greater, with an expected monthly volume of 2,000 copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 43% of the orders.

	- VB1: Minimum 25 copies per minute, 600 dpi or greater, collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of 5,000 black and white, and 2,000 color copies.
This volume band is anticipated to account for 33% of the orders.

- VB2: Minimum 30 copies per minute, 600 dpi or greater, collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of 10,000 black and white, and 5,000 color copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 19% of the orders.

- VB3: Minimum 40 copies per minute black and white, 35 copies per minute color, 600 dpi or greater,  collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of  20,000 black and white, and 10,000 color copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 3% of the orders.

- VB4: Minimum 50 copies per minute black and white, 45 copies per minute color, 600 dpi or greater,  collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of  30,000 black and white, and 20,000 color copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 2% of the orders.

- VB 5: Black & white with a minimum of 60 copies per minute, 600 DPI or greater, collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of 80,000 copies per month for B/W.  Presently there are no known VB-5 requirements.	

- VB6: Black and white with a minimum of 70 copies per minute, 600 DPI or greater, collating and stapling capabilities with an estimated maximum of 120,000 copies per month for B/W. 	Presently there are no known VB-6 requirements.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITYIS AVAILABLE ONLY TO UNIVERSITIES SPACE RESEARCH ASSOCIATION (USRA).  This work willallow for collaborating with NASA, to create prototype hardware/software infrastructureto improve water management in the San Joaquin River watershed in California (scalable toother regions) that integrates NASA information products and models.  The outputs fromMSFC effort will be merged with the other elements of this project, occurring at NASA'sAmes Research Center (ARC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).A determination has been made by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on afull and open competition basis.  A non-competitive cooperative agreement will be awardedto USRA.  Since no cooperative agreement currently exists, the prospective cooperativeagreement constitutes research that is highly specialized, and it is likely that award toany other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government thatis not expected to be recovered through competition.  Further, project co-investigatorsat USRA are co-developers of the Simulator for Hydrology and Energy Exchange at the LandSurface (SHEELS) and have unique knowledge and experience to accomplish the softwareengineering for extension of the existing framework, as well as use of the system tosupport engineering new research and applied science applications.  The short projecttime frame and extensive list of project goals would preclude training of a newscientific and software engineering team to achieve a level of expertise in all areasnecessary to complete the proposed research.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITYIS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE (UAH). This work will allowfor collaborating with NASA, to create prototype hardware/software infrastructure toimprove water management in the San Joaquin River watershed in California (scalable toother regions) that integrates NASA information products and models. The outputs from theMSFC effort will be merged with the other elements of this project, occurring at NASA'sAmes Research Center (ARC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). A determination has been made by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on afull and open competition basis. A non-competitive cooperative agreement will be awardedto UAH. Since no cooperative agreement currently exist, the prospective cooperativeagreement constitutes research that is highly specialized and if awarded to any othersource would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is notexpected to be recovered through competition. Further, project co-investigators at UAHare co-developers of the NREPS and have unique knowledge and experience to accomplish thesoftware engineering for extension of the existing framework, as well as use of thesystem to support engineering new research and applied science applications. The shortproject time frame an extensive list of project goals would preclude training of a newscientific and software engineering team to achieve a level of expertise in all areasnecessary to complete the proposed research. Thus, a substantial duplication of cost tothe Government would result if an alternative source were to be selected for, be requiredto gain competency in, and be vested with a responsibility for deploying the proposedvirtualization technologies.

Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072-A, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB), Oncogenomics Section plans to procure as a sole source the brand name Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon, 100 Reaction Kit and SureSelect AB Adaptor Set, 50 Reaction  kit from Agilent Technologies; PO Box 4026; Englewood, CO 80155-4027.

The supplies described herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract.

The Delivery Date will be one week from date of award.

The Oncogenomics Section is attempting to perform a comprehensive analysis on pediatric normal and tumor tissues using a combination of DNA microarrays, sequencing, and proteomic technologies to identify molecular fingerprints and targets for diagnosis, prognosis and development of novel therapies which can be rapidly translated into clinic and beneficial to pediatric cancer patients. 

Genome partition is a key technology for the next-generation sequence projects which are currently underway in the Oncogenomics section. This new technology is the key to identifying the most translatable targets for novel therapies for cancer patients. It saves much time and resources compared to whole genome sequencing. Agilent is the only leading manufacture that is able to synthesize high quality oligos up to 200bp with complexity of hundreds of thousands of different capture sequences using a proprietary inkjet SurePrint technology. Due to Agilents capability to manufacture long oligos, and its unique RNA probes to pull down the exome regions, SureSelect provides greater specificity, efficacy and ease of use. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 11, 2010.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist, at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Governments intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. (BAH),  8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102 for 260,000 manhours  and associated Travel and Materials  that will provide  continued research, design, development, integration, installation, test and evaluation, fielding, analysis, maintenance, training and logistics support of Navy, Army, Air Force, Special operations Forces, Joint Services, Federal Agencies, Counterdrug and other agencies Communications-Electronics Advanced Technology (CEAT) systems. These CEAT systems include analog and digital, communication/telecommunication, voice, data, video to include Video Teleconferencing (VTC), Distance Learning, Briefing and Display Systems (BDS), imagery, information warfare, cyber warfare, virtual labs, distributed processing, neural and information network systems, subsystems and equipment.  These systems are employed on various air, shore, manpack/handheld, transportable, boat and vehicular platforms.  The technical services are currently being performed by BAH under contract N00421-09-C-0016.  This acquisition will result in the modification of existing BAH contract N00421-09-C-0016 by adding a cost plus fixed-fee level of effort Option II with a performance period of approximately one year that will run from 16 April 2010 through 15 April 2011.    This directed procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of contract ceiling by 15 April 2010, approximately six months early due to an increase in project requirements.  The proposed additional one year option is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under Contract N00421-09-C-0016 while the follow-on action is being competed.  Awarding to any contractor other than BAH would result in unacceptable delays in completing or continuing tasks, such as the program requirements for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the Marine Corps Distance Learning (MCDL), the United States Marshall's Service (USMS) and the United States Capitol Police (USCP) efforts.  These services are nonseverable as no other firm can provide the corporate capabilities, intergrated program support, technical expertise and resources needed to effectively meet the requirements of these programs.  BAH is the only source available that can meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) in the short time period (one-year) between the exhaustion of the current Option Year I under, Contract N00421-09-C-0016 which expires 16 April 2010 and the follow-on contract due to be awarded 16 April 2011.  Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-09-C-0016 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAH is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 12 February 2010, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  For information contact Theresa Newbold, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, Telephone (301) 342-9921, FAX (301) 757-2276 or via email: theresa.newbold@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, (NSWC PCD), Panama City, FL intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price contract to Intermed Video Technologies, Inc. of Newtown CT for nineteen (19) each 17 inch and thirty-eight (38) each 10.4 inch video monitors to accomplish Craft Alterations on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC). The parts being purchased are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items or slightly modified COTS items manufactured by InterMed Video Technologies of Newtown, CT.  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition and it is in the best interest of the government to acquire this item using a non-competitive purchase for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers of LCAC System Upgrade and SLEP displays and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the same units for the remaining craft.  This qualification program involved extensive testing to ensure 100 percent compatibility with the display signals of the LCAC systems. These installed displays are integrated into the display console and craft wiring, and are compatible with the Alarm Monitoring System AMS, Sperry Bridgemaster E Radar, Radar Interface Converter Unit (RICU), Navigation Processor Unit NPU, and Navigation Data Integrator NDI. Other displays would require craft rewiring, qualification and testing costs that cannot be recovered through competition. Also, the current required delivery dates could not be met based on the development effort that would be required to qualify other displays. Developing another source for these displays would be cost and schedule prohibitive; it would be very expensive as there would be significant engineering and testing costs incurred (environmental).  Delivery of the monitors will be FOB destination to the Naval Support Activity Panama City (NSA PC) Receiving Office, Building 100, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407.  NAICS Code  334119.  Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees.  FSC Code 2090.  Award will be based on a responsive proposal at a fair and reasonable price.  Anticipated award date will be on or about 14 May 2010.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a full and open competition for the project titled, Dissimilar Metal Weld Fracture.

The NRC intends to award a cost plus fixed fee type contract.  The period of performance will be two years.  

The primary objective of this contract is to receive technical assistance in obtaining experimental data on the stability characteristics of complex-shaped flaws in dissimilar metal (DM) welds.  These experimental results will be used to determine if the current NRC analysis methodologies can be used to predict the load-carrying capacity of such pipe.  NRC Standard Review Plan (SRP) 3.6.3 discusses Leak-Before-Break (LBB) assessment methodologies, describing a deterministic assessment procedure that can be used to demonstrate compliance with the 10CFR50 Appendix A, General Design Requirement (GDC) 4 requirement that the primary system pressure piping exhibit an extremely low probability of rupture (xLPR).   

The RFP will be available on or about February 17, 2010 and the closing date for proposals will be approximately 45 days from the date the full solicitation is posted.  The solicitation will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions.  Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, therefore, interested parties are requested not to send letters, e-mails or faxes requesting copies of the RFP.  Accordingly, telephoned, mailed, e-mailed or faxed requests will not be honored.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any costs associated with responding to this solicitation.  

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990  All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.  The size standard for this procurement is set forth under this NAICS code.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large business, small business, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Notice to large businesses:  The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.  Thus, all large businesses must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.  

The FedBizOpps system includes the capability to join and view a published list of vendors interested in this solicitation.  This is useful for vendors who are interested in teaming on procurement opportunities.  The Contract Specialist has enabled the, Register as Interested Vendor, feature for this solicitation.

<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The agriculture sector in Rwanda accounts for approximately 40% of GDP and 75% of employment. Rwanda's land-constrained agricultural system is dominated by inefficiency of scale; average land holding size is less than one acre. The small size of farms is attributed to a rural population density of 685 people per km2 of arable land. Loss of soil fertility from erosion, one of the highest in Africa, significantly contributes to low yields. Continuous cropping without adequate soil fertility management practices has led to severe soil nutrient mining and a steady decline in soil fertility levels. All arable land in Rwanda is under cultivation, 90% of which is on hillsides. These factors combined contribute to chronic nutrition and hunger insecurity issues. Furthermore as climatic shocks become more volatile, highly variable rainfall in Rwanda will place agriculture in a vulnerable and unpredictable position. Despite a decade of rapid economic growth poverty remains high and women have little opportunity for economic gain, particularly in rural areas. Eighty two percent of households who rely on agriculture for a majority of their income are poor. More than one third (34%) of households in Rwanda are female-headed.</p>
<p>During the April 2009 G20 Summit, President Obama called on the U.S. Congress to double financial support for agricultural development in developing countries, to more than $1 billion in 2010 as a permanent solution to food insecurity by restoring rapid and sustained economic growth that directly engages the world's poorest populations, many of whom depend on agricultural labor for their household incomes and food consumption.</p>
<p>USAID/Rwanda's Economic Growth program will incorporate and lead the U.S. Government (USG) Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative (GHFSI) in Rwanda. The program, currently under development, will contribute to higher level objectives, specifically the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to reduce hunger, poverty, and child malnutrition by half by 2015. GOR was the first country to sign a Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) Compact in 2007. The Africa-led CAADP, which is coordinated by the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), is a framework for catalyzing increased strategic public and private investments in agricultural research; policy, rural infrastructure development, and agricultural outreach, by national governments (GOR) and donors around an agreed agenda and rationally organize portfolios that will transform the sector.</p>
<p>B. BASIC FUNCTION<br />The Senior Agriculture Advisor will serve as the technical and policy advisor for USAID/Rwanda's agricultural development programs and projects within the Economic Growth (EG) program and lead implementation of the GHFSI in Rwanda. Specifically, the Advisor will provide technical leadership in planning, developing, budgeting, implementing, managing, and monitoring the USAID/Rwanda's expanding program to foster food security in Rwanda. This program is comprised of several projects that promote increased agriculture productivity, expanded markets and trade, improved economic opportunities for Rwanda's very poor, enhanced regional integration, and strengthened agricultural research. The incumbent facilitates and maintains technical discussions with the Government of Rwanda (GOR), the Rwandan private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGO), other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, multilateral donors, and implementing partners. S/he is expected to be entrepreneurial, resourceful, and innovative to identify and conceptualize promising initiatives and leverage USG, GOR, and other donor funds.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will receive no response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Technology Transition Support to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement and AFRL/SBIR Technology Transition Support Capability Package are attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the AFRL and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requirements.
The SBIR Technology Transition Support includes, but is not limited to, Customer Support, Planning and technical support to the AF SBIR Program Office to facilitate transition of SBIR products into use by AF acquisition programs. The support will require strong aerospace engineering expertise, business acumen, clarity in communicating technical information, and excellent technical writing/editing skills. The contractor will be within short commuting distance of each of the four AF Product Centers (located at Los Angeles Air Force Base (AFB), Wright-Patterson AFB, Hanscom AFB, and Eglin AFB) and include an additional transition agent to support the three Air Logistics Centers (located at Robins AFB, Tinker AFB, and Hill AFB).  The following provide additional details.  
This effort will require a current Secret Facility Clearance.
The Air Force anticipates a one year contract with four one year options.   All respondents are required to currently hold a vehicle on the General Services Administration FSS Schedule 70 SIN 132-51 Information Technology Services.
All respondents are required to certify they currently meet the small business requirements under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, $7M, as of the date of their proposal submittal.  This requirement is an anticipated set aside for those contractors that meet the small business NAICS 541611 certification requirement on the date of contract award, not when they last renewed their GSA contract.
All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package which explicitly demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  Foreign contractor participation at the prime level is not permitted.  The capabilities package requirements are to be presented in accordance with the attachments entitled "Capabilities package."  Your package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance relevant to the requirements cited above.  Your Capabilities Package should not exceed 15 pages and should include the following:  Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; Certification of small business status; GSA Schedule 70 contract number and expiration.  Please submit one (1) hardcopy of your response to ASC/PKEIS, Attn:  Travis McCullough, 2275 D. St, Bldg. 16, Rm. 128, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (937) 656-7475, and one (1) PDF formatted copy via email to Travis.McCullough@wpafb.af.mil.  Packages s! hould be submitted no later than 2:00pm, EST, Feburary 28, 2010.  No facsimile responses will be accepted.
The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the PIXS website.
If you have any questions, you may contact Travis McCullough at Travis.McCullough@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is hereby conducting market research to determine the availability and capability of potential sources (both large and small) including small disadvantaged businesses ( i.e., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide services in support of Medicaid and CHIP Payment Error Rate Measurement program (PERM). The information/Capability Statements obtained from this market research will be considered in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISTION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ATTACHED DRAFT SOW. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT; ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.<br /><br /><strong>Background:<br /></strong>CMS is currently administering a payment error rate measurement program in the Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs. CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and CHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300). The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress. The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.<br /><br />CMS implemented the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) methodology to produce FY 2006 through FY 2010 State error rates for fee-for-service claims, managed care capitation payments, and eligibility determinations. This is the methodology that CMS intends to continue to use into the foreseeable future to produce national error rates that comply with the requirements of IPIA.<br /><br />CMS hired a contractor to serve as the project's technical and statistical consultant. This contractor, known as the PERM statistical contractor, assisted CMS in developing and refining the overall methodology to estimate payment rate errors. They also assisted CMS in providing technical assistance to States in understanding and implementing the PERM project; identified sample sizes needed to determine error rates; and calculated error rates. It has also been their responsibility to review, validate, and approve the eligibility sampling plans of the participating States, even though the States are reviewing their own eligibility determinations under PERM.<br /><br />The current PERM methodology currently engages two Federal contractors as follows:<br /><br />(1) a statistical contractor (SC); and<br />(2) a review contractor (RC). <br /><br />This contracting strategy has been designed to allow concentration of assignments, fluidity between tasks, and timely completion of projects; and as such, it is imperative that all PERM contractors maintain open communication with CMS and amongst one another. The standard operating procedure for the contractors administering the PERM program is as follows: <br /><br />1) SC initiates the tasks for PERM by contacting the selected States, obtaining the necessary claims information, and pulling the statistical samples; and, if necessary, the SC requests and receives full claims detail from the States;<br />2) RC requests State medical policies and requests medical records from Medicaid/CHIP providers; <br />3) RC uses the policies and medical records to perform the medical reviews and also visits State offices to perform data processing reviews; <br />4) RC provides its findings to the SC who calculates State and national error rates based on the information received from the RC; and <br />5) RC and the SC jointly write the Medicaid and CHIP final reports that are submitted to CMS. <br /><br />The SC must work effectively and efficiently with CMS and the RC, as well as Medicaid/CHIP State representatives.<br />During the spring of 2009, in order to improve the PERM process and introduce efficiencies to reduce State burden, CMS tested the concept of a minimum dataset to fulfill the PERM data submission requirements. The goal of the minimum dataset initiative was to reduce the burden placed upon states by the PERM program by shifting the majority of the universe programming tasks from the states to the SC and by requiring only a single data submission per quarter. During the minimum dataset pilot, states submitted claims, recipient, and provider files from which a CMS contractor was able to successfully identify PERM sampling units and create PERM Fee-for-Service and Managed Care universes that contained all data necessary for the rest of the PERM process. Due to the positive outcome of the Minimum Dataset Proof of Concept Special Study, CMS will allow selected states to utilize the minimum dataset data submission method in the FY 2011 PERM cycle and beyond.<br /><br />Response Information: <br /><br />In order to respond to this notice, contractors must be able to indicate experience and/or the ability to provide all of the numbered points below. Give enough detail so your response clearly indicates that you can provide the following: <br />&bull; Creation of accurate and complete Medicaid and CHIP universes from submitted state provider, claim, and recipient files using your familiarity and understanding of the PERM requirements and methodology;<br />&bull; Ability to perform statistical functions and provide statistical guidance in accordance with agency standards;<br />&bull; Knowledge of state-specific Medicaid and CHIP programs, state-specific Medicaid and CHIP data characteristics, and unique state nuances in Medicaid and CHIP programs and data;<br />&bull; Strong working knowledge of Medicaid/CHIP policy, claims processes, payment systems, Medicaid/CHIP-specific claiming situations, and managed care programs.<br /><br />Please include the following in your response: <br /><br />Business Information --<br />a.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This is a Sources Sought notice; this is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This procurement will be firm-fixed price and is funded in whole by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act [ARRA] of 2009 and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541940 and the small business size is $7.0M. SCHEDULE: The National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) intends to award a follow-on contract to Sound Technologies, Inc. of Carlsbad, CA for a TruDR NX Acapella Mobile Digital Radiography system for use on a variety of small animal species in multiple locations throughout the campus. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories has been tasked with conducting research on the Novel influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin. The laboratory currently has several Acapella mobile digital x-ray systems on site which were procured from Sound Technologies in Carlsbad, CA. This additional piece of x-ray equipment is necessary to meet the increased workload of this new research project. Therefore, this system must be fully compatible with the existing systems so data can be shared and reviewed on any one of the units. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is FAR 6.302-1(ii), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services that will satisfy agency requirements. Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for . . . highly specialized equipment when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This equipment is designed as an integrated x-ray generator/capture station/review station in a mobile configuration. Since this piece of equipment must communicate with the current radiographic equipment, each unit must have the capabilities to take and compare images at the same location independent of which unit or location that the images were captured. <br />The equipment must be mobile with an adjustable height for both the x-ray detector and generator. This unit will be used for a variety of veterinary species in multiple locations so fixed height systems would severely limit the flexibility of the equipment. The equipment utilizes integrated image capture and fully featured review with exam compare functionality. This allows for the ability to review previous x-ray studies and simultaneously display previous images for side by side comparison at the location of image capture.<br />The equipment utilizes a DICOM Conformance for Storage; DICOM Send, Query and Retrieve; and Modality Work list. This system uses image review software that must communicate with the current image storage workstations at RML. The equipment is equipped with Veterinary DICOM private tags supported on proprietary capture and review software. This allows for appropriate labeling and documentation for a variety of animal species and breeds. This function is currently utilized on all of the radiographic equipment currently used at RML.<br />Interested firms that believe they have the capabilities necessary to accomplish this project shall provide the following information: Company Name, DUNS Number, Address, Point of Contact, e-mail address, and business size.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source requirement to the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, California for conference space, audio/visual requirements and catering services for a conference of approx. 1200 attendees.  The 1200 conference attendees are also booked to lodge at the Anaheim Marriott Hotel.  The conference will take place from March 14, 2010 to March 20, 2010.  For logistical reasons, the conference must take place at the same location where the attendees are being lodged.  The conference is required to take place in Anaheim or the surrounding area.  The Anaheim Marriot Hotel will not allow any other company to come in to provide catering or audio/visual services which therefore, makes this requirement a sole source.  This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to be used for consideration of future requirements.

<DESC>The Veterans Intergrated Service Network (VISN 11) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) with UpToDate, Inc 95 Sawyer Road, Waltham, MA 02453.  The agency need is for an online clinical reference website.  The government has determined that UpToDate Inc. is the only responsible source able to provide these services because UpToDate is a unique clinical reference that gives current answers to patient care, diagnosis and treatment questions in seconds at the point-of-care.  A well-known faculty of over 3,000 authors writes the original text.  Inclusion of specific recommendation for diagnosis and treatment make UpToDate unique among clinical information databases.  UpToDates unique features and benefits include in-house physician review for over 300 medical journals and incorporate significant clinical findings daily.  The benefit of UpToDate is that it improves organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of care by helping physicians stay current on studies, trials and medical information, and clinical management.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and the Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>January 14, 2010JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 13.106(b)(1) and 6.302-2(b)(1)1. 	The South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie L. Murphy Division, intends to negotiate with GE Medical System Information Technologies Inc., 8200 W Tower Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53223-3219 for a firm fixed price Service Agreement IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation competition 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(3) and FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).2. 	The requirement is for services to replace a defective digital detector on the GE Medical  System Model:Definium AMX700 Serial#1011458WK5 EE# 82434 LOCATION:  H113-AMH-SA.3. 	The Radiological Unit has a Bona Fide need to procure repair services for the the GE AMX700.  The estimated cost for the repair service is $109,000.00.  4. 	In accordance with 10. U.SC. 2304(c)(3), 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and 6.302-2(b).5. 	This service is required to continue the use of obtaining images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of radiography.   The system has been used on multiple VA patients based on physicians' orders due to certain types of ailments.  This X-Ray model is transportable and is carried to the patient's bedside to have an X-Ray of that particular area. This is a critical requirement as this item is used on the different floors and more importantly in the triage area.  This item is used daily and   to expedite the continued use would keep the hospital patient system flow running at its normal frequency.  The vendor can provide the parts and service in a timely manner.  Software and passwords used to install the necessary part is proprietary to GE Medical and can't be used or duplicated by other vendors.6. 	A Combined Synopsis and Solicitation will not be posted in the Federal Business Opportunity System, under FAR authority 6.302-2, due to the bone fide need to the care of VA patients.        7. 	It is anticipated that the negotiated cost to the Government for this procurement will be fair and reasonable based on GE providing the same service in the commercial market.8. 	Market research:  there are no known contracts with the government, and the service required is specific to the manufacturer of the item as they are familiar to the model itself.  Based on my market research for companies to repair GE Models AMX700, there was no one who was listed in GSA or on the internet who had the capability to repair this type of equipment.  As a result of the market research it was determined that only one company could provide the required items, so in accordance with FAR Part 13.106(b) (1) procurement action was initiated.  9. 	Another vendor or repair service provider who may not work on this type model is not justifiable.  It would be technically incapable to have an unknown vendor or service supplier source to work on this mode.  It is justifiable to have the manufacture or supplier whom the item was purchased to repair the model.  This would save the time for the continued use or the product and money based on the need of the required repairable service due to the serviced patients.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

The approach includes strengths which significantly outweigh the weaknesses.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is at least moderate, as the proposal solutions are feasible and practical.  These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. <BR><BR>Unacceptable- The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  This approach has numerous weaknesses which outweigh the strengths.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical.  The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirement.<BR><BR>Factor 2 Past Performance- The offeror will submit past performance of 3 current or previous contracts for relevancy (within the last 3 years) based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollars value, scope and complexity.

References information should include the name, address, fax number and telephone number of the Contracting Officer or contract administrator. Phone interviews with the references submitted for the past contract efforts on similar work will be used to confirm those efforts and determine whether they met or exceeded contractual requirements.  Reference should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractors to be used.  The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. <BR><BR>Factor 2, Past Performance, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale <BR><BR>ADJECTIVAL	DESCRIPTION<BR> Low Risk-  Little doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR><BR>Moderate Risk-	Some doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR> <BR>High Risk-	Significant doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR><BR>Unknown Risk-	Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.<BR><BR><BR>Factor 3  Price- Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness and to determine the best overall value to the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620 ,  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and is designated as full and open competition.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development,(ORD) National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) Air Pollution Prevention & Control Division (APPCD) in RTP, NC, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, on a firm-fixed price basis, intends to procure Movement of Air Monitoring Shelters services:  
Four air monitoring stations (8? x 20?) are located at the following addresses in Las Vegas: 1) Site 1 -- 2964 Post Road; 2) Site 2 -- 2874 Post Road; 3) Site 3 -- 2734 Post Road; 4) Site 4 -- 6193 Dean Martin Drive.  These 4 air monitoring stations are required to be moved from these Las Vegas locations to the following locations in Detroit, Michigan:
Site ID	Site Description	Latitude	LongitudeSite 1	10 Meter Roadside	42.386000?	-83.266404?Site 2	100 Meter Downwind	42.386809?	-83.270644?Site 3	300 Meter Downwind	42.388269?	-83.271439?Site 4	Upwind	                  42.384762?	-83.265786?
The air monitoring shelters and instrumentation shall be disassembled, packed, loaded onto flatbed truck(s), transported to Detroit; unloaded; shelters leveled; unpacked; reassembled and set-up, turned on and calibrated.  A picture of a typical Las Vegas Ambient Air Monitoring Shelter is shown at the end of this SOW.  This equipment list may be found in Attachment A.
The contractor shall in all respects be responsible for the shelters and equipment for the duration of this activity until successful completion of the verification step.  The contractor shall be responsible for replacing or repairing at the discretion of EPA any equipment damaged or lost during this activity.  This includes equipment damaged or lost during disassembly, packing, loading onto flatbed truck(s), transportation to Detroit; unloading; shelters leveling operation; unpacking; reassembly and set-up, turn on and calibration.  
This is to be a turn-key operation ? the transport and set-up of the air monitoring shelters shall be performed in a manner such that when EPA staff arrives at the Detroit site, the air monitoring shelters shall be in all respects ready to operate and begin taking ambient air quality measurements.  The final step will be verification -- EPA staff shall verify instruments are operating properly prior to accepting successful completion of this effort.
It is anticipated that any computers and equipment that were originally installed and set-up by EPA personnel will be the responsibility of EPA to disassemble and ship to Detroit.  This equipment list is shown in Attachment B.
The EPA reserves the right to incorporate the vendor?s proposal into the SOW if there are elements of the proposal that are beneficial to the EPA?s ability to implement this activity.
Timing of Move ? It is estimated that these air quality monitoring shelters will be required to be in place and operating (taking ambient air quality measurements) by April 15, 2010.  This schedule may be impacted by a number of factors: 1) right-of-entry permits onto job sites; 2) utility connections; 3) other permits/inspections; 4) weather conditions in either Las Vegas, Nevada or more importantly by weather conditions in Detroit, MI.

<DESC><p>Namibia is one of the PEPFAR countries of emphasis, with a fiscal year 2009 budget of $102 million. In Namibia, the PEPFAR program is implemented by the following U.S. government agencies: the Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (DOD), Peace Corps and the U.S. Department of State (DOS). Achieving the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) targets for Namibia requires strong collaborative leadership skills and dynamic coordination. The incumbent is designated by the Chief of Mission (Ambassador) to serve as principal point of contact and coordinator of PEPFAR activities in Namibia. Working under the direction of the Chief of Mission (COM), the Coordinator plays a critical role in facilitating effective planning, implementation, and reporting of performance of inter-agency programs. The Coordinator is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a problem-solving negotiator. S/he works closely with all USG agencies involved in HIV/AIDS programming in Namibia, focusing as an honest broker to ensure a coordinated USG HIV/AIDS response in collaboration with the Government of Namibia, as well as other donor groups and implementing partners in country. The Coordinator chairs the interagency PEPFAR Management Team (PMT) which is comprised of senior representatives from each of the five USG agencies involved in PEPFAR/Namibia. The Coordinator may represent the PEPFAR program at official meetings. When the Coordinator meets with counterparts from the Government of Namibia, s/he should include USG agency leads or, if not possible, consult in advance with agency leads. The Coordinator leads the development, preparation, and submission of the Partnership Framework, the country operational plan (COP), semi-annual performance review (SAPR), and annual performance review (APR). The Coordinator is responsible for coordinating responses to regular and ad hoc requests from the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) for ensuring that reports are submitted to OGAC on time for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-agency work; and for keeping agencies on task for inter-agency efforts.</p>

<CONTACT>Paige L. Shin, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022055858, Fax 2027084964, Email paige.shin@gsa.gov
<DESC>The GSA, National Capital Region, Washington, DC, is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services for the Design of an Annex to the existing Southern Maryland Courthouse in Greenbelt, MD. The estimated project construction cost range is $80 million to $90 million. This construction cost range excludes the cost of the design effort in the proposed design contract. GSA anticipates using the traditional Design-Bid-Build method of project delivery. The effort will commence with concept development and continue through to 100% construction documents and post-construction services. The completed construction documents will be included in a separate construction contract solicitation.
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption. In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements, including the P100 [Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service]. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, including standards mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).</p>
<p>The Southern Maryland Courthouse Annex project will increase the size of the Southern Maryland U. S. Courthouse (SoMD CT) in Greenbelt, Maryland from 424,816 gsf to 687,395 gsf. The incremental 262,579 gsf courthouse Annex will be accomplished by adding:<br />1) a new stack of jury deliberation rooms in support of existing courtrooms and newly renovated courtrooms;<br />2) expansion of the existing building to add U.S. District Court (USDC) chambers and U.S. Marshal Service (USMS) support spaces; <br />3) the addition of other court functions such as U.S. Bankruptcy (USBC) courtroom and chambers, U.S. Attorney's offices, and Pretrial and Probation, and U.S. Trustee's, and 11 inside parking spaces; and<br />4) the addition of outside parking spaces in a parking garage expansion.</p>
<p>Renovation of the existing offices will provide more efficient usage of the existing facility. These additions to the SoMD CT will meet the Judiciary's 10-year need corresponding with the year 2020, and the 30-year need. The Judiciary's Five-Year Plan, which reflects construction priorities approved by the Judicial Conference, includes an expansion of the existing SoMD CT in Greenbelt, MD for site and design funding.</p>
<p>The Southern Maryland Courthouse is situated on a 9.3 acre parcel at 6500 Cherrywood Lane in Greenbelt, Maryland in Election District 21. The site is bounded on the east and north by open space owned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, on the west by open space owned by a private developer and to the south, across Cherrywood Lane, by a private developer. Access to the site is from a single controlled entrance off of Cherrywood Lane.</p>
<p>The project will incorporate cost-effective and innovative strategies including the utilization of photo-voltaic systems to meet the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and goals to reduce energy consumption per Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005. This project shall include a comprehensive application of design principles that will result in a high performance green building capable of achieving at least Silver certification by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) using the latest version of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Efforts are to be made, if feasible, to achieve a higher level of certification.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The proposed A/E Design Contract (Base Contract) will require, but is not limited to, preparation of design documentation and related services as follows: drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, renderings, mock-ups, computer graphics, color/material selections and presentations, system design and calculations, life cycle costing, value engineering, programming, space planning, and other similar services as determined to be required. In addition, the A/E Design Contract will require the A/E Design Firm to provide computer aided design (CAD) documentation, including building information modeling (BIM), a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews, and concept approval submission(s) and presentation(s) to the PBS Commissioner. The GSA will require the A/E Design Firm to make such presentations to other public authorities and commissions for project approvals as required.</p>
<p>SELECTION PROCESS: <br />This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of Lead Designers and their A/E Design Firms. The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:<br />STAGE I: <br />The first stage will establish the experience and capabilities of the Lead Designer and A/E Design Firm.

(a)	Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: 

(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." 

*The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard C2CEN, 4000 CG Blvd, Portsmouth, VA 23703, hereby presents this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

(2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 

*Warranty renewals for UPS systems installed at USCG D11 and D5 Command Centers.   Note:  Currently, both UPS systems are covered under existing Emerson / Liebert warranty contracts (3 year contracts) set to expire for the D5 UPS on 10 APRIL 2010, the D11UPS on 10 JUNE 2010.

(3)	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). 

A Service Maintenance Agreement (SMA) for the UPS Units that will provide 3 year extensions to the current warranty service provided for both D11 and D5 Command Center UPS systems. 

  Note:  Currently, preventative maintenance visits/checkups are performed for both systems during normal business hours Monday-Friday every 6 months by Emerson / Liebert factory trained technicians.  Post-maintenance reports are forwarded by the technician to C2CEN via OSCS Steven Corry.

	-

(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 

*6.302-1 (2) (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

*Liebert Services Customer Engineers are factory trained specifically for components and parts associated with both UPS systems at D5 and D11.  Both UPS systems were originally purchased by C2CEN from Emerson / Liebert and are currently maintained and serviced under an existing contract(s) purchased in 2007 that will soon expire.  With the extension of warranty contracts for both D5 and D11s UPS systems, a seamless extension of current warranty services will occur.  

Emerson Network Powers Sole Source Service Provider document (included in this purchase request by OSCS Steven Corry) states on page 2 that if a contract is held with a third party vice with them going forward and a critical situation arises where Liebert Services is called to the site(s), the work performed will be billed back to the end user and not the third party.  Because Liebert Corporation is a sole-source manufacturer/service provider, they do not support third party organizations with technical back-up or guarantee parts availability.

(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 

*Requirement shall be posted on Fed Biz Ops as a Sole Source Acq that only the OEM can provide this SMA, with a Statement that any Offerors that propose within 5 days of Posting will be considered by the Gov.

(7)	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

*Prices offered will be compared to previous acquisitions. 

(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 

*Two companies, GTSI and APC, were contacted by OSCS Steven Corry and both reported that they are unable to provide the warranty services on the UPS systems as described by Emerson / Liebert.

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. 
(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. 

* Emerson / Liebert Company will not guarantee the reliability of third party parts and/or equipment substituted in lieu of Emerson / Liebert recommended parts should they be installed for any reason. 

For these reasons and others previously detailed, it is strongly recommended that C2CEN continue its current warranty contract relationship(s) for the D5 and D11 UPS systems with Emerson / Liebert to ensure the future reliability of both systems as per original factory specifications.

(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 

*None at this time.

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 

*None at this time.

(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 
(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45N98 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI/Haiti program will further the high priority U.S. policy objective of helping restore stability in Haiti after almost complete destruction of the capitol and severe impairment of the Government's ability to communicate effectively - both inter-governmentally and with the Haitian people. USAID/OTI's goal for its engagement in Haiti is supporting the Government of Haiti in the aftermath of unprecedented destruction to the country after the January 12, 2010 earthquake.</p>
<p>The initial objectives for the OTI/Haiti program will be: (1) support the Government of Haiti (GOH) by promoting stability and decreasing the chances of unrest; and (2) facilitate GOH efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>Illustrative activities may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Communications: OTI could provide support to Government of Haiti (GOH) ministries in coordination with the U.S. Embassy to assist in the restoration of communications capacities, both external and intra-governmental. OTI could provide assistance on generating and disseminating updated information on the recovery efforts and humanitarian assistance. This is critical for stemming unrest and promoting governing stability.</p>
<p>Government Rehabilitation: OTI could work with GOH and the U.S. Mission to provide basic infrastructure and supplies that facilitate efforts of the GOH to restore core government functions. Assistance may include "Ministries-in-a-Box" packages that contain desks, chairs, computers, and communications equipment, as needed.</p>
<p>Jobs: OTI could establish a short-term jobs program that will hire local Haitians to remove rubble, repair roads, and rehabilitate key infrastructure.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a OTI Deputy Country Representative - Haiti</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Port au Prince, Haiti. While the post is currently still a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents, depending on the security situation, this could change quickly to a non-accompanied post that would not allow minor or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to respond to disasters around the world on behalf of the U.S. Government (USG), DCHA/OFDA projects itself overseas in a variety of ways. First, DCHA/OFDA maintains six permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office in the following locations: San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Budapest, Hungary. Second, in countries where DCHA/OFDA has a large humanitarian response portfolio, it establishes a Program Office (currently eight) within the USAID Mission or U.S. Embassy. Third, in the event of major disasters, DCHA/OFDA may deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the affected country.</p>
<p>The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of the Operations Division. It was created to meet the need for administrative support and intervention as OFDA's presence in the field grew following the opening of these regional and program offices. As more staff were permanently deployed to support emergency programs in Africa and Asia, OAT's role in administrative intervention prior to and following deployment of staff has become more significant. OFDA now has 16 locations in the field that are directly supported by OAT. The team consists of four members: the Administrative Officer for Field Operations (as the Team Leader), two Administrative Support Coordinators, and an Administrative Support Assistant.</p>
<p>In 1999, OFDA instituted a program of contracted personal services contractors (PSCs) who could provide short term, on-call assistance to the office as the need arose. This program, called the Support Relief Group (SRG), has grown from an initial group of 12 to a potential pool of up to 75 contractors. The management of this program is part of the OAT portfolio.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of an Administrative Support Coordinator (ASC) who will provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide. The ASC will also support the surge capacity program (SRG). The incumbent will report to the Administrative Officer for Field Operations and backstop the other Administrative Support Coordinator.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The ASC will:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations.

<p>&bull; Perform frequent site visits to ensure that OFDA resources are being properly utilized, to assess local administrative support needs, and to provide training to field administrative personnel;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide specific support for SRG PSCs and field PSCs.

<p>&bull; Review budgets and recommend funding levels of the supported overseas offices and of overseas personal services contracts. Send fund cite cables as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the establishment/disestablishment of any overseas activity that may include deployment as an Administrative Officer; assess local administrative support capabilities; assist with local procurement, and establish procedures whereby the OFDA staff interact seamlessly with USAID/Embassy personnel support for the establishment of any overseas activity;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee the daily operation and maintenance of the Support Relief Group (SRG) program. Maintain databases. Support the activation of SRG, assist with the development of their statements of work, facilitate their orientation to the administrative, financial, technical operations and training requirements of OFDA, and monitor the evaluation process of their performance after each activation;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform miscellaneous administrative tasks such as working with Agency's financial and acquisition and assistance systems and with OFDA's financial planning system, as well as the updating of data in the SRG database as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Work closely with the contracting staff and the USAID Office of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure sufficient funding is available for contract renewal;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with the training staff to define training requirements and assist in the preparation of training materials of SRG and OFDA field staff. Facilitate OFDA organizational meetings overseas;</p>
<p>&bull; Attend security management workshops and perform periodic reviews on all overseas locations for operational effectiveness;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate on Resource Management Teams (RMT) and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART) as needed;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Haiti</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>The OTI/Haiti program will further the high priority U.S. policy objective of helping restore stability in Haiti after almost complete destruction of the capitol and severe impairment of the Government's ability to communicate effectively - both inter-governmentally and with the Haitian people. USAID/OTI's goal for its engagement in Haiti is supporting the Government of Haiti in the aftermath of unprecedented destruction to the country after the January 12, 2010 earthquake.</p>
<p>The initial objectives for the OTI/Haiti program will be: (1) support the Government of Haiti (GOH) by promoting stability and decreasing the chances of unrest; and (2) facilitate GOH efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>Illustrative activities may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Communications: OTI could provide support to Government of Haiti (GOH) ministries in coordination with the U.S. Embassy to assist in the restoration of communications capacities, both external and intra-governmental. OTI could provide assistance on generating and disseminating updated information on the recovery efforts and humanitarian assistance. This is critical for stemming unrest and promoting governing stability.</p>
<p>Government Rehabilitation: OTI could work with GOH and the U.S. Mission to provide basic infrastructure and supplies that facilitate efforts of the GOH to restore core government functions. Assistance may include "Ministries-in-a-Box" packages that contain desks, chairs, computers, and communications equipment, as needed.</p>
<p>Jobs: OTI could establish a short-term jobs program that will hire local Haitians to remove rubble, repair roads, and rehabilitate key infrastructure.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a OTI Country Representative - Haiti.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Latin American/Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Port au Prince, Haiti as the senior OTI representative in the country. While the post is currently still a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents, depending on the security situation, this could change quickly to a non-accompanied post that would not allow minor or adult dependents. <br /><br />The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Haiti country program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.

<p>&bull; Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff;</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAID's Automated Directives System);</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate.</p>
<p>Supervisory Relationships</p>
<p>The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), or his/her designee, as well as to the Haiti Mission Director.</p>
<p>Supervisory Controls:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>Physical Demands:</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>Work Environment</p>
<p>While in post of assignment], the work is generally performed in an office environment.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

ATF needs one user account for at least five (5) staff members to use (under 1 Account/License) to send news releases to the vendors for distribution to newsrooms and wire services and to retrieve clippings (not concurrently).  
Regarding the lines for News Clipping Service, ATF needs the Seller to capture written news stories that mention the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) (and other key words) in newspapers, TV news programs and online news sources.  ATF will supply a list of key words that should be searched daily upon award.   Many TV news stations and networks publish their broadcast stories in text form on their company websites.

Delivery a couple of days to a couple of weeks after the fact is NOT an acceptable delivery turnaround time from date of publication.
ATF is not requesting archival services.
ATF will only have privity of contract w/the Awardee regardless of any teaming arrangements made by the Seller.
Regarding payment, the first year of the contract will be paid in full upon award of the Purchase Order.  Determinations regarding full or monthly payments of the option years will be made pending review of the prior year's service.<BR><BR>The time to submit Questions has passed - All Questions were to be submitted no later than 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Thursday, 1/28/10.<BR><BR>Q1:  RE: "Newswire Distribution" - does the ATF require transmission of news releases via a secure wire service network (AP or similar), or is email/Web distribution sufficient? And does this Newswire feed need to reach print, broadcast and online media outlets simultaneously, or just print? 
A1:  ATF does not require a secure wire service network to transmit news releases. Whatever transmission mechanism that is utilized should be able to reach print, broadcast and online media simultaneously.
Q2:  RE: Monthly numerical/statistical analytic reports of placements of news releases and/or mentions of ATF - Does the ATF require these reports to include tonality of coverage (positive/negative) and breakout by media type, subject/topic and provide comparative metrics vs. similar organizations who receive news coverage on similar issues?
A2:  ATF requests monthly numerical reports of placements of ATF news releases,  broken down by state.
Q3: Is the client asking the provider to create, edit, and deliver a daily report by 6 AM EST in addition to the monthly report?
A3:  ATF only requires daily clipping service.  It requires a monthly statistical report regarding placement of ATF releases.<BR><BR>

During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs), entry requirements to the installation may change with little to no notice. During FPCON Charlie, contractors without a "C" on their CAB may be denied access. Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorismmeasure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy.

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

Questions & Answers 1/28/2010
QUESTION:

Can you confirm that the government has and can make available a copy of the original programming code for each room or will the contractor be required to develop new code?

ANSWER:

We do not have the code for the three rooms. When I spoke with the vendor who
previously installed the rooms, he stated that the code within the AMX
control system is not encoded and can be extracted. Also they do not have a
copy of the code.  If the contractor cannot extract the code they will
indeed need to reprogram.

QUESTION:

Does each room have the exact same make and model equipment or is
there variation of the equipment make and model, room to room?

ANSWER:

Each room has dissimilar equipment since they were assembled at different
time frames.

Questions & Answers

Q1- Our engineer informs us that in his opinion the truss depth sizes are limiting and will not allow for the desired wind loading. Regarding building # 2,3 and 4.  Please allow for a truss depth of 30".  We find that the limiting truss depth of 18" results in an inefficient design, one that will not adequately meet the wind load specs of 110 MPH. The exterior dimension will be two feet wider at 50' wide but will still yield the required 45' interior clearance.  And the overall height will be 1 foot higher at the center. This modification will allow Shelter Structures to bid you and engineered structure with efficient truss spacing.  Utilizing stronger and heavier trusses on wider spacing  yielding more interior space. 

A1- The width of buildings 2, 3 and 4 can only be 48' wide because of the width of the concrete slab that the structures are going to be installed on. 50' wide is not going to work.

Q2- In regard to Tent 1, What is the net interior width and the net center height of this Tent? Ground Snow Load 20 Lbs? Is the 12 ft sidewall the inside sidewall  clearance?
Is the Lighting protection system UL rated or not?  Would we be dealing with Prevailing wages on this site?

A2- Net interior width is 133 and the net center height is 38.  Ground Snow load of 20LBS sounds correct.  The Lightning protection system is UL rated and yes you will be dealing with Prevailing Wages.

Q3- Does the tent need to be 133 wide and 70 length or can it be 70 wide x 133 length? 

A3-It has to be 133' wide.  We are using it to house two aircraft that are 45' from wingtip to wingtip.  And due to flight line limitations the structure needs to be 133 wide by 70 length.

Q4- All tent structures have a width larger than the length is this correct?

A4-Yes the measurements that are listed in the Spec sheet is what is needed to meet our needs and the locations for the tents to be constructed.

Q5- Do you need to have a MD contractors license in order to bid this project?

A5-  I do not think so.  This is on A Federal Government Institution.

<DESC>Q6-  Will you consider an alternate fabric to the 28oz PVC assuming all the other components of our spec meet what is listed in your specification?

A6-  As we have been instructed by upper management no deviations from the specs are allowed. So over-All Buildings Systems will have to quote to the 28 oz. PVC.

<DESC>Q7.  Question 1 mentions the 48' existing slab for which we can adjust our structure to fit, my question is at what clearance height above the slab does there need to be 45' clear for the wing tips? We have 2 options, a straight column or a tapered truss to work with and want to match the best option for your needs.

A7.  I think a tapered truss would probably work best.  As long as we have clearance for two aircraft at 45 ft. wide for each aircraft on the 133' x 70' structure. The tent height has to be 45' high from the slab for the jet exhaust plume.  This was the minimum height requirement for heat reason concerning our CV variant.  


NO MORE QUESTIONS ALLOWED DUE TO THE URGENCY OF THIS REQUIREMENT.

<p>A. Place of Delivery</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Office of Health Affairs<br />National Biosurveillance Integration Center <br />245 Murray Lane<br />Washington, DC 20528</p>
<p>B. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) principal authority for all medical and public health matters. Within OHA the National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center's (NBIC) duty is to aggregate and integrate information from food, agricultural, public health, environmental monitoring, and the intelligence community within federal and state agencies and private sources to provide an early warning system for an outbreak or possible bioterrorism attack. <br /><br />The Government's objective is to receive content aggregator service that provides a collated RSS (Really Simple Syndication aka Rich Site Summary) data feed of health incident report information garnered from public sources reconciled to Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs requirements in order to test and evaluate the suitability and applicability of a content aggregator's compatibility with the NBIC.</p>
<p>(Background)<br />HSPD-9 dated 30 January 2004 and HSPD-10 dated 21 April 2004 directs DHS to establish a National Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS) to provide early detection and situational awareness of biological events of potential national consequence by acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and disseminating existing human, animal, plant, and environmental biosurveillance system data into a common operating picture (COP) that represents a comprehensive depiction of the global biosurveillance security environment (GBSE). The NBIS, comprising of representatives from all member agencies, will integrate and analyze all-agency/source biosurveillance information to recognize unusual biological events and provide situational awareness to the NBIS community and decision-makers through the development of a biological COP (BCOP) and targeting reporting. The BCOP will augment the DHS National Operation Center's COP, which provides a consistent, integrated picture of biosurveillance situational awareness throughout the country. The NBIS will facilitate collaborative interagency analysis to ensure fully-integrated biosurveillance situational awareness and provide near-real time awareness to the Incident Management Group (IMG) and the DHS National Operations Center (NOC). Public Law 110-53 directs DHS to establish the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) to facilitate improved information sharing and enhanced situational awareness to facilitate national decision-making to enable timely response.</p>
<p>C. Requirements</p>
<p>1. In the midst of the 2009-H1N1 pandemic and in preparation for other biosurveillance events of potential national significance, DHS' Office of Health Affairs' Weapons of Mass Destruction and BioDefense Division, National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) has an urgent need to obtain verified biosurveillance data.

<p>4. 3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict of Interest. (JUN 2006)<br />(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting [Data used from this product/service may result in the future development of OHA NBIC requirements, as such the awardee would be excluded from competing for those requirements] .<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation.

<p><br />VI. Evaluation</p>
<p>A. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition as described below:</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in order of importance:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability <br />(ii) Past performance<br />(iii) Small Business (SB) participation <br />(ii) Price</p>
<p>The technical evaluation factors: The evaluation criteria are stated in descending order of relative importance. When combined, technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than Price, which is non-rated. As the overall rating of technical criteria among quotations tends toward equality, price becomes more important in making the award determination. Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quotation if the Government determines that paying a price premium is warranted due to the evaluation of technical criteria. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that paying a price premium is not warranted. While price is not a rated criterion, it is significant.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>B. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>C. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>
<p>VII. List of attachments<br />A. Attachment one: FAR 52.212-3 incorporated in full text. <br />B. Attachment two: Past Performance survey. <br />C. Attachment three: Small business participation</p>

A001: Questions and Answers:

1.	To clarify Section 1.5 states the contractor shall submit all deliverables on or about April 15 2010  I believe this date is meant to be April 15 2011, am I correct?

Answer:
1.  No, The deliverable date is correct April 15, 2010 this date is set for the delivery & performance requirements; as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the scope of work (SOW).  The period of performance of this contract shall be one year from the date of the contracting officers signature on the contract (see combined synopsis/solicitation).

2.	Can you please give me a clear definition of the Project Sponsor? (Particularly as it relates to section 3.3 of the proposal- are the project sponsors pre-determined by the RFQ- i.e. SMAA SOCAR or are they determined by the contractor, or a combination there of?

Answer
2.	The second question relates to the project sponsors (grantees)  in this case, it is a combination. Each project that they evaluate will have a project sponsor  this RFQ lays out several possible projects, and the project sponsors could be those entities that are listed in Section 1 (SMAA, SOCAR), but could be other appropriate private or public entities, on the listed projects, or any other projects that the DM contractor discovers during their trip (such as port security projects, which are not described in detail).

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI/Haiti program will further the high priority U.S. policy objective of helping restore stability in Haiti after almost complete destruction of the capitol and severe impairment of the Government's ability to communicate effectively - both inter-governmentally and with the Haitian people. USAID/OTI's goal for its engagement in Haiti is supporting the Government of Haiti in the aftermath of unprecedented destruction to the country after the January 12, 2010 earthquake.</p>
<p>The initial objectives for the OTI/Haiti program will be: (1) support the Government of Haiti (GOH) by promoting stability and decreasing the chances of unrest; and (2) facilitate GOH efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>Illustrative activities may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Communications: OTI could provide support to Government of Haiti (GOH) ministries in coordination with the U.S. Embassy to assist in the restoration of communications capacities, both external and intra-governmental. OTI could provide assistance on generating and disseminating updated information on the recovery efforts and humanitarian assistance. This is critical for stemming unrest and promoting governing stability.</p>
<p>Government Rehabilitation: OTI could work with GOH and the U.S. Mission to provide basic infrastructure and supplies that facilitate efforts of the GOH to restore core government functions. Assistance may include "Ministries-in-a-Box" packages that contain desks, chairs, computers, and communications equipment, as needed.</p>
<p>Jobs: OTI could establish a short-term jobs program that will hire local Haitians to remove rubble, repair roads, and rehabilitate key infrastructure.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a OTI Deputy Country Representative - Haiti</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Port au Prince, Haiti. While the post is currently still a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents, depending on the security situation, this could change quickly to a non-accompanied post that would not allow minor or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>Supervisory Relationships</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>Supervisory Controls:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>Physical Demands:</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>Work Environment</p>
<p>While in the country of assignment, the work is generally performed in an office environment. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Haiti</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI/Haiti program will further the high priority U.S. policy objective of helping restore stability in Haiti after almost complete destruction of the capitol and severe impairment of the Government's ability to communicate effectively - both inter-governmentally and with the Haitian people. USAID/OTI's goal for its engagement in Haiti is supporting the Government of Haiti in the aftermath of unprecedented destruction to the country after the January 12, 2010 earthquake.</p>
<p>The initial objectives for the OTI/Haiti program will be: (1) support the Government of Haiti (GOH) by promoting stability and decreasing the chances of unrest; and (2) facilitate GOH efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>Illustrative activities may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Communications: OTI could provide support to Government of Haiti (GOH) ministries in coordination with the U.S. Embassy to assist in the restoration of communications capacities, both external and intra-governmental. OTI could provide assistance on generating and disseminating updated information on the recovery efforts and humanitarian assistance. This is critical for stemming unrest and promoting governing stability.</p>
<p>Government Rehabilitation: OTI could work with GOH and the U.S. Mission to provide basic infrastructure and supplies that facilitate efforts of the GOH to restore core government functions. Assistance may include "Ministries-in-a-Box" packages that contain desks, chairs, computers, and communications equipment, as needed.</p>
<p>Jobs: OTI could establish a short-term jobs program that will hire local Haitians to remove rubble, repair roads, and rehabilitate key infrastructure.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a OTI Deputy Country Representative - Haiti</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Port au Prince, Haiti. While the post is currently still a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents, depending on the security situation, this could change quickly to a non-accompanied post that would not allow minor or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull; Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>Supervisory Relationships</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>Supervisory Controls:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>Physical Demands:</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>Work Environment</p>
<p>While in the country of assignment, the work is generally performed in an office environment. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><strong>c. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Type of Contract</span> </strong><em>[Revised]</em></p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of up to four (4) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to the <em>most highly qualified firms</em>to perform required services. Prime contracts will contain Firm-Fixed-Price, Time-and-Material, Labor-Hour, and Cost-Reimbursable Contract Line Items (CLINs). TO contract type is negotiable; however, it is anticipated most Task Orders (TOs) will have firm-fixed-priced labor with cost-reimbursable line items, as required.</p>
<p><strong>d. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Range, Limitations, and General Information</span></strong> <em>[Revised]</em></p>
<p>(1) Guaranteed <em>minimum</em> under each IDIQ&nbsp;contract is $50K.</p>
<p>(2) Cumulative ceiling price for all IDIQ contracts <em>shall not exceed</em>$30M. Ceiling price includes all TOs awarded against all IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>(3) Anticipated <em>minimum</em> TO award is $25K.</p>
<p>(4) Anticipated <em>maximum</em> TO awards are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Environmental Planning - $1.5M</p>
<p>(b) Programming - $1.5M</p>
<p>(c) A-E Services - $1M</p>
<p>(5) Fully Burdened Labor Rates (FBLRs) - Maximum FBLR for each labor category shall be negotiated and fixed for the 5-year contract period.</p>
<p>(a) Firms receiving a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be required to complete a cost proposal workbook prepared by the Government in Microsoft EXCEL. The cost workbook identifies required labor categories and requires input of "base rates" for each labor category and "indirect rates" used to calculate "maximum" FBLRs.</p>
<p>(b) The Government will evaluate each maximum "base rate" and "indirect rates" applied to the "base rates" to calculate the "maximum" FBLR for each labor category for years 1 thru 5. "Base rates" and "indirect rates" will be determined fair and reasonable, or negotiated to a fair and reasonable price, prior to contract award.</p>
<p>(c) Requirement for payment of "maximum" FBLRs - The Government will pay "maximum" FBLRs only when contractor employees are paid the "maximum" base rate used to calculate the "maximum" FBLR. Reduced base rates paid to employees mandate reduced FBLRs proposed/billed to the Government. This requirement is mandated because "base rates" vary among employees performing the same services; therefore, FBLRs will vary commensurate with "base rates" paid to employees. Maximum FBLRs protect the contractor, and reduced FBLRs when applicable protect the Government from overpayment of profit. Example of FBLR maximum &amp; reduced calculations:<br /><br />"Maximum" FBLR = $40.73 per hr <br /><br />Max Base Rate Awarded:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $25.00 <br />Fringe (20%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.00<br />OH (25%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 6.25<br /></span>Subtotal #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $36.25<br />G&amp;A (7%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.54<br /></span>Subtotal #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $38.79<br />C.O.M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />Profit/Fee (5%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.94 <br /></span>Max FBLR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$40.73* [Based on <em>maximum</em> base rate paid employee.]<br /><br /><br />Reduced FBLR = $35.03 per hr</p>

<p><em>*Indirect rates remain constant</em></p>
<p>(d) A nominal annual escalation rate may be applied and negotiated prior to award. The nominal escalation rate shall be based on historical averages.</p>
<p>(e) Firms proposing/billing escalated FBLR each year shall pay employees the "escalated base rate" for the Government to pay the escalated rate.</p>
<p>(f) Labor "vacancy credit" requirement - Labor "vacancy credits" shall be provided to the Government when a Firm-Fixed-Priced "full-time" contractor employee position is required and the position becomes vacant during the performance period. The vacancy credit begins the first workday the position is vacant and ends when the position is filled with an equally or higher qualified employee. All personnel replacements shall be pre-approved by the Government to ensure their qualification and experience are equal to or higher than the individual they are replacing.</p>
<p>(g) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indirect Rat</span></strong>es - This agency is seeking firms with affordable rates. High indirect rates may be viewed as inefficient cost control within the firm and considered unrealistic/unreasonable. Therefore, a close review of your firm's indirect rates now is recommended. This will afford you ample time to determine the "best rates" your firm can provide if selected as one of the most highly qualified.</p>
<p>(h) <strong>Profit </strong>- Profit is negotiable; however, profit proposed in excess of 5% is considered reasonable for "high risk" requirements, and services required for this acquisition are not considered "high risk."</p>
<p>(6) Travel Expense - Travel shall be pre-approved by the Government and a cost-reimbursable expense. An additional G&amp;A fee may not be applied to travel expenses on this acquisition as G&amp;A fees are paid in the FBLR calculation.</p>
<p><strong>e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance</span></strong></p>
<p>(1) Prime Contract - Period of performance is 5-years from date of award. No options shall be included.</p>
<p>(2) TOs - Period of performance shall vary depending on the project. TOs requiring more than 12-months to complete will include options.</p>
<p><strong>f. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Factors</span></strong> <em>[Revised]</em></p>

<p>(2) Firms shall be evaluated in terms of -<br /><strong><br />(a) Professional Qualifications</strong>- Primary technical services shall be performed by the Prime Contractor's "in-house" personnel who are credentialed members of architectural, science and engineering professions. The Prime Contractor may subcontract portions of the requirement to a credentialed professional (licensed to practice within the State where the task is to be performed) provided the Prime Contractor's Project Manager (PM) is a credentialed professional with the necessary expertise, in terms of knowledge and experience, to undertake the specified task (but is not licensed to practice within the State where the task is to be performed). Therefore, qualified firms shall employ professionally qualified, experienced employees with a work history within the primary task areas who are professionally credentialed architects and/or engineers, certified planners (American Institute of Certified Planners), and Registered Environmental Managers (REM). "In-house," subcontracted, or consultant personnel identified as credentialed professionals in response to this SS/RFI will be identified as "Key Personnel" in subsequent contract awards to the most highly qualified firms; therefore, ensure personnel identified in the SS/RFI response will be assigned to EP2AE projects. Substitutions of Key Personnel after award must be with personnel having equal or higher qualifications and approved by the CO prior to filling the position. Qualified firms shall possess professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services in all primary task areas:</p>
<p>(1) Environmental Planning - <br /><br />(a) Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as defined 32 CFR, Part 989 and;</p>
<p>(b) Base Comprehensive Planning, as defined in AFI 32-7062</p>
<p>(2) Programming, as defined in AFI 32-1021, AFI 32-1022, AFI 32-1032, and AFI 32-6002</p>
<p>(3) Architect-Engineer (Title I) Services.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence</strong> - Prime contractor and/or subcontractors / team members should demonstrate successful specialized experience and technical competence working in the primary task areas for the Air Force. To be considered specialized experience, a firm must have completed the work under the company name provided as the prime or subcontractor performing at least 50% of the requirement. The Prime Contractor must demonstrate a history of partnering, or teaming, with the subcontractors proposed (if any). Individual team members must also demonstrate a history of partnering, or teaming, with other members of the proposed team;</p>
<p><strong>(c) Past Performance</strong>- Prime contractor and/or subcontractor(s)/team members must demonstrate successful recent and relevant performance on similar projects in all primary task areas performed for the Air Force (desirable), other Government agencies, and/or private industry within the last 3-years. The Prime Contractor and subcontractor(s) (listed on SF 330 - Part I, Section C, Block 9), evaluation ratings in the following categories shall be reviewed: Quality of Product/Service; Schedules; Cost Control; Business Relations; and Management of Key Personnel. "Marginal," "Poor," or "Unsatisfactory" ratings in any of the performance areas is not desirable. The Prime Contractor and subcontractor(s) past performance information will be retrieved from PPIRS utilizing NAICS 541310 and the DUNS number provided after the firm's name in Part I of the SF 330. For specific instructions on completing Part I of the SF 330, reference the attachment titled "TABLE 1 - SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS," file name "EP2AE - Submission Requirements;"</p>
<p><strong>(d) Capacity</strong> - Qualified firms must have the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. The Prime Contractor and any proposed subcontractors must demonstrate a history of the ability to complete multiple Task Orders simultaneously within the contracted performance periods using in-house resources. Use of SB subcontractor(s) is encouraged, but not required;</p>
<p><strong>(e) Location</strong>- A firm's location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project is a plus; provided application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project. Geographic location of the Prime Contractors, or subcontractors, office responsible for providing services identified in the primary task areas, near Cannon AFB, NM; and/or Hurlburt Field, FL is highly desirable to reduce TO on-site response times, and to encourage the use of local SB firms.</p>
<p><strong>(f) Cost/Price</strong>- Under the Qualification Based Selection (QBS) procurement process procedures, price quotations are not a consideration in the selection process for the most highly qualified firms. Cost/price of base rates and indirect rates for required labor categories will be evaluated/negotiated in conjunction with response to the RFP issued to up to four of the most highly qualified firms.</p>
<p><strong>***IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong>: Responses provided on the Market Research Questionnaire (MRQ) will be "cross-referenced" with proposal submitted by the firms selected to receive an RFP; therefore, ensure your responses on the MRQ are accurate and will match your proposal if solicited. MRQ responses that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not</span>match subsequent proposal submitted in response to the RFP will "DISQUALIFY" your firm from possible contract award as MRQ responses are "part" of the evaluation criteria used to select the most highly qualified firms. <strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>g. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection Procedures</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) Prime Contracts</strong> - This agency anticipates holding discussions with <em>up to</em> six (6) of the <em>most highly qualified firms</em>. After discussions are complete, the firms will be ranked in order of precedence. <em>Up to</em> four (4) of the <em>most highly qualified firms</em> will receive a <em>"draft"</em>RFP for question and response, followed by issuance of the "final" RFP. Selected firms will have <em>30 calendar days</em>to respond to the final RFP. Once proposals are received negotiations of the "maximum" FBLRs for identified labor categories for the 5-year period will begin. If <em>reasonable maximum FBLRs</em> cannot be negotiated with one or more of the most highly rated firms, negotiations with the firm(s) will terminate and the firm(s) will be requested to submit a final proposal revision. If the final proposal revision pricing is determined <em>unreasonable</em>, the next firm(s) in order of precedence "may" receive an RFP to facilitate award of <em>up to</em>four (4) IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Task Orders</strong>- Qualifications and past performance of all IDIQ contract awardees will be evaluated against each TO requirement and the firms will be ranked in order of precedence. The firm determined <em>most highly qualified</em>to perform the task will receive a TO RFP. The firm will have "up to" 30 calendar days to submit a proposal (technical and cost). The suspense for proposal submissions will be based on the complexity and value of the task. Tasks estimated at $100K or more will have a 30 calendar day suspense. If the technical proposal is determined inadequate and/or if a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated with the selected firm, discussions will terminate and the firm will be requested to submit a final proposal revision. If the final proposal revision technical and/or cost/price proposals are determined inadequate/unreasonable, respectively, the next most highly qualified firm for the task will receive the TO RFP. The same process initiated with the "first" selected firm will be followed with the next selected firm (and the next, if necessary) until TO award is made as "all" firms selected to receive an IDIQ contract award will be qualified to perform all task requirements.</p>
<p>(a) In selecting the <em>most highly qualified firm</em>to receive a TO RFP, a greater significance will not be attributed to "secondary factors," such as geographic proximity or equitable distribution of work, than to qualifications and past performance. Evaluation criteria will be project specific and cost/price will always be evaluated and determined fair and reasonable; or negotiated to a fair and reasonable cost/price prior to TO award.</p>
<p>(b) Since <em>all</em> IDIQ&nbsp;contract awardees are qualified to perform <em>all</em> task requirements, the possibility exists that two or more firms may be equally technically qualified to perform the requirement. In such cases, consideration will be given in three additional areas:</p>
<p>(i) Volume of work awarded during the previous 12-months.</p>
<p>(ii) Superior performance, as appropriate, on recently completed requirements.</p>
<p>(iii) The extent to which a firm commits to SB, and to small disadvantaged business, historically black colleges and universities, or minority institution performance on the task, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Competition in Contracting Act</strong> - Architect-Engineer contract award. Using the procedures contained in FAR Part 36.6 is considered a competitive procurement under the Competition in Contracting Act. Competition is not on price, but solely on technical qualifications.</p>
<p><br /><strong>III. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</strong> <em>[Revised]</em></p>
<p><strong>a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Copies</span></strong> - Submit original, five (5) copies, and a Compact Disk (CD) (containing the entire package) of the following documents:</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:  1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php. 2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<SUBJECT>Y--RENOVATION OF 17 OPERATAING ROOMS AT NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MARYLAND.
<SOLNBR>N4008010R4405
<CONTACT>Bianca Ferguson 301-295-2931
<DESC>This proposed contract action based on other than full and open competition will be a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Clark/ Balfour Beatty (CBB) joint venture for a Design Build contract to renovate 17 Operating Rooms at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. It was requested that other than full and open competition be permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (2) as implemented by the FAR 6.302-1 - only one responsible source.
The work will include the repairs, upgrades and reconfigurations of 17 existing Operating Rooms (OR) as well as the reconfiguration and renovation of adjacent supporting spaces and systems including mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure to create ORs that fully comply with DOD unified facilities criteria.
A separate project, BRAC Design/Build contract was awarded to CBB, which requires the addition of three (3) state-of-the-art ORs to the existing NNMC OR suite.  These three new ORs will enable the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) to perform specialized surgery now performed at the current Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).  These three new ORs under the BRAC program are required in order to facilitate the closing of WRAMC. 
This special project of "Renovation of 17 Operating Rooms at National Naval Medical Center" was not included in the BRAC renovation scope of work because it's not a requirement for the realignment. This special project will be a facility sustainment/ modernization project which will be funded separately from the BRAC appropriation. However, the commonalities and adjacent locations of these projects strongly support the execution by one contractor. 
The estimated release of the J&A is the 4th of February 2010.  The time frame for receipt of proposals will be provided in the solicitation notice.

<p>JSSC streamlined the processes involved in soliciting, evaluating, awarding and administering contracts for Information Technology (IT) Services. The process maintains a competitive environment while considering the recurring needs of both customers and suppliers, and focuses on reducing costs and implementing performance-based contracts.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Joint Staff Support Center at two different locations, the Pentagon and an Alternate Site, is a field command and a vital component of DISA. Since its establishment in 1963, JSSC has played a vital role in our nation's defense by providing support to every war, major contingency, training exercise and humanitarian relief operation where our military forces have been deployed. JSSC's mission is to provide global command and control automated data processing, audio-visual support capabilities and contract oversight for the Department of Defense to meet national security objectives in peace and war. JSSC accomplishes its mission with the assistance of our industry partners. JSSC executes its C2 local and global mission through four core processes. They are: IT Service delivery, IT Service Support, Information and Communication (ICT) Infrastructure Support and Information Assurance. Global Mission Support is defined as any and all support associated with the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES), Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS), Global Common Operational Picture (COP) and Global Command and Control System (GCCS-T) Strategic Support Enclaves and all actions associated with support of the Global Tier II Service Desk. Local Mission Support is defined as any and all actions that support the customer base in the Pentagon, National Capital Region and at the Alternate Site.<br />.<br />3.0 Capability Requirements</p>
<p>The Mission of the JSSC is to provide quality products and services to our customers for Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems, Information Assurance, multimedia and visual information, Continuity of Operations and technical oversight support to the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Joint Staff and their partners. The functional areas are: Program Management, Service Desk Support, Systems Operations, Administration and Maintenance, Database Administration, Data Management, Network Operations Support, Customer Training Support, Enterprise Management, Continuity of Operations, Multimedia Support, Joint Web Risk Assessment Cell (JWRAC) Support, Information Systems Security, Performance Monitoring and Lifecycle Support. The organizational requirements are recurring, one-time and small/large complex initiatives that may require knowledge of DoD C2 business processes for Combatant Commanders worldwide.</p>
<p>4.0 Contract Security Clearance Requirements</p>
<p>Access to classified information, up to and including TOP SECRET for Sensitive Compartment Information (TS/SCI), is required in performance of this project. As such, the contractor will supply personnel with TOP SECRET or TS/SCI security clearances as required. The ADP Position Sensitivity Designation is ADP-II, Non-critical Sensitive because information on the operational status of GCCS will be accessible by the contractor. Contractor personnel shall comply with security requirements outlined in DCID 6/4 DoD 5105.21-M-1, DoD 5200.2. Verification of compliance must meet one of two criteria: (1) Up-to-date SSBI or SBPR with favorable adjudication and appropriate clearance for the position, verified by the JSSC Personnel Security Office (PSO). (2) Favorable adjudication of Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or Single Scope Background Investigation Periodic Reinvestigation (SBPR) completed by the appropriate adjudication facility. Contractor access to JSSC facilities must be approved and granted by the JSSC Personnel Security Clearance Office (PSCO). <br /><br />5.0 Acceptable Contract Performance Levels</p>
<p>The Performance-based contract will require the contractor to meet a multitude of Performance Standards unique to JSSC's requirements and capabilities. A Performance Standard, critical to the success of JSSC's mission, addresses the contract full-time equivalent (FTE) vacancy rate. The contractor solution must not exceed a vacancy rate of 5%, on any given month, and must provide personnel who are fully qualified and skilled to perform JSSC's requirements. All personnel shall be technically qualified, have in-depth experience levels and possess comprehensive managerial or technical backgrounds in the required disciplines. In addition, emergency "on-call" support may be required, in selected disciplines, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to address critical mission needs.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228.  The modification includes work for Wind Energy Technology Reseach and Development (R&D) and Testing in three areas:

  Sandia Corporation (Sandia) will provide documentation on the generic wind turbine models that were developed as a collaborative effort by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) Wind Generation Modeling Group.  
  Sandia will collaborate with the University of Massachusetts Lowell in assessing the impact of wind turbine blade defects, and developing quality assurance and diagnostic tools in manufacturing and testing of wind turbine blades.  
  Sandia will work with Alpha STAR Corporation to analyze failure mechanisms in a composite wind turbine blade and develop a redesigned blade optimized for failure resistance and low weight.  Specifically, Sandia will develop and deliver finite element blade models, and data from material, ultimate load, fatigue, and field tests.  

The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to the Sandia Corporation through the issuance of a work authorization (WA) pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract, which was awarded as a cost reimbursement type contract due to the uncertainties in contract performance.  Cost cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain.  The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract.  Sandia was selected by the Department of Energy to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter.  The funds will ensure the best selection of grantees proposing the best approach in support of new, expanded or re-equipped domestic manufacturing facilities with a goal of growing the domestic manufacturing industrial base with clean energy, sustainable economic growth, job creation, and reduced generation of greenhouse emissions.  The work falls within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy which is covered by the prime contract Statement of Work, paragraph 3.3, entitled Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy that states: The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation.  

NOTE:  This action is awarded under prime contract Modification no. A369 that recognizes Work Authorization no. 100254-20758-10 issued under M&O Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.
