<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies 88,360 rentable square feet of space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 83,337 BOMA usable square feet available for use by the Government for personnel, furnishing and equipment, including 124 parking spaces.  The lease term requirement is for 5 years with one 5 year renewal option.  The space must be available for occupancy by January 31, 2006.  The delineated area is in the National Capital Region.  The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease or relocate to an alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, amongst other things, the availability of alternate space that can potentially satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.  Expressions of interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00PM on September 30, 2005, and must include the following information: Building name and address; Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced; ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced; Date of space availability; Method of rentable space measurement; Building ownership information; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost - include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any); List of building services provided. The Government's decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

It serves as the nation's premier research hospital for    conducting clinical research to improve the health of mankin   d.  It also serves as a national resource for clinical resea   rch by developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions,    enhancing systems to ensure the safe, efficient, and ethical    conduct of clinical research, training clinical researchers   , and leading the response to the nation's public health nee   ds.  The CC admits patients from around the country and the    world who participate in experimental treatments and studies   .   In 2005, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC)    was opened.  The state of the art facility is home to the n   ew inpatient units, day hospitals and research labs and conn   ects to the existing Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center,    which opened its doors to patients in 1953.  Together, the M   agnuson and Hatfield centers form the NIH Clinical Center, t   he world's largest clinical research complex, serving a dual    role: providing humane and healing patient care, and an env   ironment for clinical researchers to advance clinical scienc   e.   The Housekeeping and Fabric Care Department (HFCD) of the CC    is responsible for maintaining the hospital facility at the    highest level of cleanliness.  This includes the patient ar   eas, laboratories, offices, public areas, exhibits and other    surroundings, support and common areas.  To assist in accom   plishing these tasks, the HFCD has employed the use of many    specialized vendors.  This announcement is another request f   or specialized assistance.   A company is needed to provide specialized floor care which    is to include the labor, materials and equipment to clean th   e grout, sanitize, apply anti mold agent, and seal the floor   s in 358 bathrooms in the CC complex.  There are 240 patient    bathrooms, within patient rooms, at an average size of 52 s   quare feet, and 118 public bathrooms which average 225 squar   e feet each.   To be considered, a company must have had experience in prov   iding these types of services in other facilities that can b   e verified through references, and present a plan to accompl   ish the effort with a timeline to complete the work in each    of the two different bathroom types.     Specifically the following must be provided to be considered   :   (1)   Fixed pricing for cleaning each type of bathroom in th   e following format:   Cost for each patient bathroom = $          x 240 bathrooms    =  $                             Cost for each public bathroom  = $             x 118 bathrooms =  $   (2)   The estimated time to accomplish the complete process    in each bathroom type.   (3)   References with names, titles and phone numbers.   (4)   A list of all specific products and equipment to be us   ed.  As this is a medical facility, some types of products m   ay be deemed unacceptable for use.   It should be noted that upon completion of each bathroom, an    inspection will be conducted by an HFCD representative to i   nsure acceptability.  All unacceptable bathrooms are expecte   d to be redone at the vendors expense.

<DESC>1.  The 37th Contracting Squadron, Lackland AFB TX, has a requirement to provide chapel music services in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number FA3047-06-TC050.  The performance period is 01 October 2005 through 30 September 2006, with 4 one-year option periods.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.  Award is contingent upon availability of funds.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05 and DFARS Change Notice 20050901.  The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 711130; size standard $6,000,000.00.

2.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.  Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.  Oral quotes will not be accepted.  Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.  To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.  To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.  Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.   

3.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Addendum:  Basis for Award:  This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.  For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.  Offers shall propose on all items.  Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.  An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.  Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.  The evaluation process will proceed as follows:  (a) Technical Acceptance:  By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, and requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.  Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:  Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price, including option prices.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism subject to the processes described in paragraph 8.  Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.  Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished; (c) Past Performance:  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:  To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.  Relevancy:  Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.  Magnitude consists of the contractor's ability to provide a variety of music for multi-faith groups.  The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves providing/managing musical support services to military chapel program of the same or similar size, complexity, magnitude, and diversity of faiths as that outlined in the solicitation.  Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves providing/managing musical support services to smaller  military chapel program or a large non-military religious congregation with average attendance of 500 or more persons per week for all services combined.  Somewhat Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves involves providing/managing musical support services to a smaller religious non-military congregation with average attendance of less than 500 persons per week for all services combined.  Not Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involves providing/managing musical performances of a secular or non-religious nature.  More relevant past/present performance will receive greater weight than less relevant performance in assigning an overall confidence rating.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.  The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.  Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.  The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.

5.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.  The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.  The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  A trade-off process is then conducted.  The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.  A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.  In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.  

6.  Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.  Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.  When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.  The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.  The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.  An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.  If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.  The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:  The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:  (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: See Note 22.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order under GSA schedule with Technology Service Corporation (TSC) located at 1900 S. Sepulveda Blvd, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90025-5659, as a follow on effort for testing and installation at JFK airport of TSC’s newly developed Airport Security Display Processor (ASDP); a stand-alone signal processor and display system which provides perimeter intrusion detection. The proposed period of performance is four (4) months from date of contract award. The ASDP signal processor, designed and developed by TSC, is an independent, parallel processor designed specifically for security applications. The ASDP system burn-in testing and optimization testing & evaluation (OT&E) can be performed by TSC only due to the fact that TSC is the original ASDP system developer. No other organization is permitted to modify the system. The TSA knows of no other vendor with the unique set of skills and system knowledge possessed by TSC. The cost and time that would be required for another company to acquire the skills needed to perform the proposed work is prohibitive.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Enteprise Support Office, DES-ACC, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the Pennsylvania State University. This procurement will be a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Pennsylvania State University, under the authority of (FAR) Part 6.302-1, for a three-day “Logistics Transformation and Change Management” training program which includes faculty staffing and instruction, program instructional materials, plus faculty travel.  The classroom facility and on-site administative support will be provided by DLA.  The place of performance will be determined by DLA and will be within the military district of Washington, DC. The training will support the DLA Customer Support Office (CSO) Marine Corps Team (CSO-M) to obtain a certificate in Supply Chain Management through the Penn State University who has partnered with the United States Marine Corps to establish the Marine Corps Logistics Education Program (MCLEP).  Although MCLEP is not a prerequisite to attending the Logistics Transformation and Change Management course, both courses are required to obtain a certificate in Supply Chain Management.  The training offered by Penn State University Executive Programs has direct application to DLA’s Business Systems Modernization (BSM) efforts.   Therefore, it has been determined that Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, is the only viable source to meet the Government’s requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) WILL BE AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement as stated herein may submit a response. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice, only responses in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Subject:	Amendment 1 to the Radiation Belt Storm Probes AO On or about September 10, 2005, Amendment No. 1 to NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) entitled “Radiation Belt Storm Probes Investigations and Geospace-Related Missions of Opportunity" (NNH05ZDA003O) will be posted on NASA’s research opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select “Solicitations” then “Open Solicitations” then “NNH05ZDA003O”).   The Radiation Belt Storm Probes AO is amended so that a Low Cost Access to Space (LCAS) platform (including sounding rockets and standard and long duration balloons) may be proposed as the launch vehicle for a Mission of Opportunity investigation if the investigation can significantly augment the Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission objectives. The Radiation Belt Storm Probes AO is also amended to identify the Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate as the Selection Official. Proposers are advised to read the entire text of the amendment, which is posted on NASA’s research opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/. Direct questions specifically regarding this solicitation to: Dr. Barbara L. Giles; LWS Geospace Program Scientist; Earth-Sun System Division; Mail Suite 3Q39; Science Mission Directorate; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Washington, DC 20546-0001; TEL: (202) 358-1762; E-mail: Barbara.Giles@nasa.gov (subject line to read "LWS RBSP AO"). AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE NASA ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY (AO) ENTITLED "RADIATION BELT STORM PROBES INVESTIGATIONS AND GEOSPACE-RELATED MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY," NNH05ZDA003O, RELEASED AUGUST 23, 2005 The following changes are made to: • Section 5:10: Geospace-Related Missions of Opportunity  • Section 7.1: Evaluation, Selection, and Debriefing Processes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 5:10, Geospace-Related Missions of Opportunity is amended by adding a section, 5.10.4, Low Cost Access to Space Missions as Missions of Opportunity 5.10.4	Low Cost Access to Space Missions as Missions of Opportunity Under this AO, a Low Cost Access to Space (LCAS) platform may be proposed as the launch vehicle for a Mission of Opportunity (MO) investigation if it is demonstrated, as judged by peer review and the NASA LWS program staff, that the investigation can significantly augment the LWS RBSP mission objectives and that its support by NASA would be advantageous to the LWS Program.  In this case, the Mission of Opportunity sponsoring organization is SMD and no other sponsoring organization is required. The LCAS program offers a variety of methods for providing low cost access to space, including sounding rockets and standard and long duration balloons.  These missions are Missions of Opportunity in the sense that (i) NASA may or may not select one or more LCAS missions, and (ii) the cost cap for LCAS missions is the same as the Mission of Opportunity cost cap.  In all other regards, the proposal requirements for a LCAS mission proposal are the same as for all Mission of Opportunity proposals to this AO.  LCAS MO proposals under this AO are required to describe a complete suborbital investigation, including payload construction, launch phase, data analysis, and publication of scientific results.  Proposals should be for whatever time period is required in order to complete the investigation.  Proposers must take into consideration the fact that the total expense associated with a suborbital investigation includes costs for operational support as well as payload development.  The full cost of operational and launch support expenses must be included in proposals to this AO. All those who intend to propose a suborbital LCAS MO are required to discuss prospective investigations with operations personnel at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility to ensure that probable operational and launch support costs are properly represented within proposals.  Questions concerning sounding rockets may be addressed to:	Mr. Philip Eberspeaker, Sounding Rocket Program Office, Telephone: (757) 824-2202, E mail: Philip.J.Eberspeaker@nasa.gov.	Questions concerning balloon experiments may be addressed to:  Mr. David Pierce, Balloon Office, Telephone: 301-286-8437, E mail:David.L.Pierce@nasa.gov. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 7.1, Evaluation, Selection, and Debriefing Processes, Paragraph 14, is amended Section 7.1, Evaluation, Selection, and Debriefing Processes, Paragraph 14, is amended to state that the Selection Official for the AO is the Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate.  Paragraph 14 is further amended to state that the AO Steering Committee is appointed by the Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) intends to award a sole source contract to Clear Channel Satellite Services of Centennial, CO for Nomadic System Management, Support, and Services.  The period of performance for this contract will be October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006 with two option years.  NRCS intends to award a contract by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A)(B).  A determination was made not to compete this proposal because this will be a follow-on contract to a previous pilot contract for the acquisition of nomadic units, which is a self contained system that provides wireless two-way, high speed network connectivity to the USDA backbone network via VSAT (satellite) and Digital TV (DTV).

Also, since this equipment is already installed, awarding this contract to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would incur unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  The contract will also provide project management and operation, network service, maintenance and support services, bandwidth service, use of vendor’s network, network management, Internet Protocol connectivity services, interconnect facility, project/ implementation management, installation of equipment and software, training, ongoing support, and on-site maintenance.

The Technical Assistance will address the urgent need in Haiti for reliable power and expanded access to energy.  Currently, only 11 percent of Haiti’s population is connected to electric lines and less than one-third of Haiti’s installed generation capacity reaches end users.  To address these issues, the Technical Assistance will assess the current state of Haiti’s electricity sector; recommend priority electricity generation, transmission, and distribution projects for action; and assist EDH in developing a strategy for financing technically and economically viable projects.

The key objectives of the Technical Assistance are: 1) to review and assess the current state of the electricity sector; 2) to develop priority reconstruction projects for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; 3) to develop new investment projects for generation, transmission, and distribution; and, 4) to assist EDH in developing a strategy for financing the technically and financially viable projects.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following tasks:
1) Review and assess electricity sector issues and the existing system; 2) Identify specific technical system requirements; 3) Develop generation, transmission, and distribution projects; 4) Develop capital and operations and maintenance cost estimates; 5) Conduct economic and financial analyses; 6) Conduct development impact assessments; 7) Conduct environmental assessments; 8) Develop financing plans; and 9) Prepare and submit final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFP's received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct concept exploration research and development in support of the Department of Defense's Rotary Wi ng Vehicle (RWV) Technology Development Approach (TDA).  See http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/TDA_TEOs.ppt for additional information.  The long-range objective of AATD's Platform Technology programs is to support rotary wing aviation's fielded fle et and developmental & future systems by developing, demonstrating, and applying technology solutions in the areas of airframes, rotors, flight controls, and subsystems to advance capability while reducing life cycle costs.  This long-range objective is su pported by the TDA 4.0 and ASSP Technology Effort Objectives (TEO), which include: improved aircraft maintenance through the use of sensors for structural inspection and health monitoring; reduced aircraft parasitic weight through the use of multifunctiona l structures; increased aircraft threat survivability; and reduced structures development and manufacturing time and cost through innovative processes and virtual prototyping. Interested offerors shall submit proposals, which include program concepts, ideas and methodologies based on maturing technologies, a description of relevant past experience and capabilities, and a cost estimate in accordance with the following instruction s:   SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There are three topics under this announcement with the following areas of interest:   TOPIC 01-2006:  Structural Integrity Monitoring System  With greater performance requirements placed on Army rotorcraft to be lighter, faster and stronger, airframe structures are being pushed to their limits.  In order to ensure aircraft reliability and mission success, the structural integrity of critical com ponents will require monitoring.  Having a clear understanding of an aircraft's structural integrity will enable the pilot to safely fly within the aircraft's limits as well as notify the crew when maintenance actions are required.  This will ultimately im prove safety, performance, reliability, readiness, and reduce maintenance time and cost. As an effort to better monitor rotorcraft's structural integrity, AATD is interested in developing and applying a Structural Integrity Monitoring System (SIMS) for the health monitoring of metallic and composite structural components.  SIMS should enable r eal-time, autonomous monitoring of large, complex, integrated and/or inaccessible structures without jeopardizing the strength or performance of the structure.  The system is intended to enhance the Army's Rotorcraft Structural Integrity Program (RSIP) (se e http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/RSIP.ppt for additional information) as well as complement the Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) initiative (see http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/CBMplus.ppt or http://akss.dau.mil/dag/Guidebook/IG_c 5.2.1.2.asp for additional information) by allowing for maintenance actions based on real-time or near real-time assessment of equipment status.  SIMS should also assist the pilot, by providing an in-flight assessment of the aircraft's structural integrity , whether manned or unmanned aircraft. The objectives of this topic are: (1) Develop a methodology to gather the required information needed to assess the structural integrity of the monitored component(s) through sensors or sensor networks.  This objective includes developing an effective mech anism to embed or fasten the sensor(s) to the structure without weakening or interfering with the structure.  (2) Develop the required algorithms to translate the transmitted sensor data and determine the structural integrity of the component and aircraft.   (3) Develop an integrated system that provides real-time structural integrity status to the aircrew and maintainer. AATD seeks proposals to develop and apply SIMS technologies  to legacy and future rotorcraft generic structure.  The proposed SIMS should provide accurate, real-time assessment of the component's and aircraft's structural integrity by detecting the location and severity of damage.  The intent of this topic is to de velop a SIMS, therefore offerors should consider state-of-the-art COTS sensor solutions before developing new sensors.  Sensor packages should have a life of at least that of the structure they are monitoring.   Wireless, self-powered sensor systems are de sired, but not required.  Offerors should also keep in mind that small, lightweight solutions are crucial in rotorcraft applications; therefore size and weight impact will be considered in evaluating the proposed concepts. TOPIC 02-2006:  Multifunctional Structures for Ballistic Protection  The U.S. Army has an ongoing interest in developing aircraft structures that protect the crew and critical systems from small arms fire while remaining weight-efficient and affordable.  Current parasitic armor has a significant weight penalty that limits r ange and payload of the aircraft.  This weight penalty arises from the use of separate components for the functions of carrying loads (structure) and providing ballistic protection (armor).  Armor systems currently in use are primarily made of steel, capab le of defeating 7.62 mm ball, and typically placed on top of an existing floor.  An integrally-armored floor could concurrently serve the functions of carrying loads and providing ballistic protection, saving weight in two ways.  First, lighter weight mate rials (ceramic, intermetallic materials, etc.) offer weight savings as compared to traditional armor materials such as steel.  Second, the combination of two separate components into one leads to further weight savings.  With a multifunctional integrally-a rmored floor yielding significant weight reduction (one-third or more) as compared to typical parasitic approaches, helicopters will be able to complete their planned missions with greater payload and/or range while maintaining or improving the level of ba llistic protection (e.g. Armor Piercing versus ball).  In addition, by using existing material systems and low-cost fabrication processes, such a solution can remain affordable as compared to current parasitic approaches.  AATD seeks proposals to develop and demonstrate an affordable multifunctional integral armor solution for a utility or cargo helicopter floor that provides improved ballistic protection and significant weight reduction, as compared to current parasitic app roaches.  The design intent is to replace the current floor and add-on armor layer with one component - a floor with integral ballistic protection.  This floor should defeat 7.62 mm AP (at muzzle velocity) at a weight of at least 33% better than current st ate-of-the-art, steel-based systems, while being affordable as compared to these current systems.  The floor must also meet existing requirements for load capacity, durability, damage tolerance, tie-downs, etc.  Offerors should consider the performance of any proposed solution following a ballistic event in such areas as residual load-carrying capability, reparability, and multiple hit performance (to include the effects of the proximity of multiple hits to each other).  In addition, offerors should conside r the scalability of any proposed solution, as well as its potential to be retrofitted to a variety of (rotary-wing and fixed-wing) platforms.   The Government anticipates developmental and validation testing to support the multifunctional structures armor concepts.  If Government test facilities are proposed for use in this effort, the scope and type of testing proposed should be clearly identifie d to support the cost reasonableness determination of the overall proposal.   TOPIC 03-2006: Spaced-Armor Protection System (SPS)    Steel appliqué armor is heavy and parasitic (not integrated into the aircraft system).  Better solutions to provide grea ter ballistic protection at a lower weight are desirable.  It has been historically shown that a 'spaced-armor' design has a beneficial effect on ballistic protection.  A spaced armor system consists of:  (1) a striker plate used to break apart and/or impa rt a rotational momentum to the projectile, (2) a gap or space to allow the projectile to rotate or tumble and (3) a 'catcher' component used to defeat and capture the broken and turned projectile pieces.  Because of previous material limitations, the spac ed-armor concept has not been implemented on a rotorcraft.  Models to optimize spaced armor performance do not exist in a useful form.  Much work has been done to describe the tumbling of a projectile, but most work is for after the projectile has gone thr ough armor.  The spaced-armor concept has been demonstrated in tests done at AATD and elsewhere, and has been implemented on M113 Personnel carriers as a means at stopping larger caliber projectiles.  Use of new, lightweight ballistic materials may make th e spaced armor design a feasible solution against small-caliber threats for rotorcraft applications. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate through modeling and test that a spaced-armor system for rotorcraft is effective (level of protection) and efficient (low weight).  At a minimum, the entire system should provide protection from small caliber threats (7.62mm Ball, 7.62mmAP, 12.7mmAP, 14.5mmAP) at a 30% reduced weight compared to current state-of-the-art steel-based systems.  New materials technologies will most likely afford the greatest weight savings for the striker plate and the catcher plat e but the overall design of the spaced-armor approach will determine its maximum effectiveness. It is also desirable that modeling and analysis tools are developed that can be used for design and optimization.  AATD seeks proposals to develop SPS technologies that can be applied to legacy and future rotorcraft.  As an effort to improve rotorcraft ballistic protection, AATD is interested in developing, modeling, and demonstrating a SPS.  Design of the system shoul d take into account typical aircraft structure such as skins, bulkheads, ribs and frames.  Offerors should consider state-of-the-art materials, while paying attention to cost of fabrication.  The Government anticipates developmental and validation testing to support the spaced armor concepts.  If Government test facilities are proposed for use in this effort, the scope and type of testing proposed should be clearly identified to support the cost reasonableness determination of the overall proposal.  The pro posed SPS should clearly show the level of protection afforded and a projected weight.   ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated funding for all awards by each topic is as follows.   TOPIC 01-2006:  Structural Integrity Monitoring System - Approximately $900k.   TOPIC 02-2006:  Multifunctional Structures for Ballistic Protection - Approximately $375k.   TOPIC 03-2006: Spaced Armor Protection System - Approximately $300k. Period of Performance for each award resulting from this announcement is desired to be 18 to 27 months starting in government FY06 and ending in government FY08.  Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule.  Topic 01-2006 has the potential for multiple awards, which may address only part of the topic's objectives.  Any government FY06 award is subject to the availability of funds.   TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must sa tisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C.  2371),  which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  Under TIA's or OT(s) it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in th e project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the  DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/32106r_ 041398/part34.pdf.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal. DATA ITEMS / DELIVERABLES:  All awards under this announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.  All awards under this Announcement will require delivery of the following data items:  (1) Program Management Plan, (2) Test Plan (if applicable ), (3) Bi-Monthly Performance and Cost Reports (4) Final Report, and (5) Executable software (if applicable).  All awards will include a requirement to present the results of the work in a final briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all techn ical effort. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this sect ion.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in adjectival ratings supported by narrative.  The adjectival ratings and narrative support will be con sidered along with other factors including the extent of restrictions placed technical data deliverables that limit the Government's ability to further exploit the results of the research and cost to the Government. The Government will develop an order of merit listing for proposals submitted under each topic.  Proposed cost will be evaluated, as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and  furthering the state-of-the-art.  Proposed cost to the Government is a review criterion.  The amount of cost sharing percentage could result in greater evaluation credit. The evaluation criteria are:  (1) the extent to which the proposed work satisfies the DOD research need by use of innovative, efficient, affordable, and suitable approaches to the stated technical problem; (2) the merit of the offeror's proposed approach t o accomplish the scientific and technical objectives; (3) the experience and qualifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and other proposed personnel; and (4) the suitability and availability of proposed facilities. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award, the successful  offeror(s) will be required to (if applicable) provide an 'Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement' certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: D LSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.

Task orders will be issued as the need arises dur ing the contract period.  It is anticipated that the first contract will be awarded not earlier than November 2005.  One or more months may elapse between subsequent contract awards.  The method used to allocate Task Orders among the Contracts will include  consideration of experience within the defined geographical boundaries of the EPA Region II and the Northwestern Division, user needs, capacity to accomplish the Task Order in the required time frame, and past performance.  This announcement is open to al l businesses, regardless of size.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,000,000 in average annual receipts.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 5 2.219-9, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for the work to be subcontracted.  The subcontracting goals for the Kansas City District are as follows:  a minimum of 50.9% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount placed with Small Busi nesses (SB), which includes 8.8% placed with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), 7.2% placed with Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), 2.9% placed with Hub Zone Small Businesses, and 0.5% placed with Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) .  The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract A ct of 1965, and will be determined per task order basis and dependant upon the requested services and location.  (2) PROJECT INFORMATION: The type of work to be accomplished could include HTRW site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling,  testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater modeling, fate and transport analysis, HTRW designs including wastewater treatment plant facilities  and landfills, surface and groundwater remediation, potable water-planning, design and operation/maintenance, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, surveying and mapping, communit y relations, and HTRW Construction Phase Services that include, but are not limited to, engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings and reviewing value engineering proposals, including radiological and mixed wastes.  Ancillary services f or architecture, landscaping, historical preservation and archaeological investigations may also be needed as a subset to HTRW mitigation.  (3) SELECTION CRITER IA:  (A) Primary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Specialized experience and technical competence: [FAR 36.602-1(a)(2)].  Responding firms should demonstrate experience during the past five (5) years.  The board will ev aluate the specialized experience on projects and the technical capabilities of the prime firm and any subcontractors.  The effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontracto rs; and prior working relationships) will also be examined.  State whether the experience is that of the prime (or joint venture), consultant or an individual.  Work cited that is experience of prime (or joint venture) from an office other than that identi fied shall be so labeled.  Specialized experience to be evaluated for this project is as follows (all specialized experience factors are listed in descending order of importance):  (a) investigation, planning, design, and construction phase services for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste cleanup projects.  Experience must demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities for diverse projects with differing contaminants in various media.  EPA Region II Superfund projects will have the greatest weight; (b) adherence to regulations and practices pertaining to hazardous waste sampling, handling, transportation and disposal.  Knowledge of local and state environmental regulations and experience dealing with local and State regulatory entities within the EPA  Region II geographical jurisdiction have the greatest weight; (c) oversight of RI, FS, RD, RA, and LTRA performed by other parties, in conformance to their respective consent decrees or administrative orders negotiated with EPA; (d) demonstrated quality m anagement procedures.  Include a proposed organizational chart and a narrative description of how the quality management procedures will function to include internal quality control and who is responsible.  (2) Professional Qualifications [FAR 36.602-1(a)( 1)].  The board will evaluate, as appropriate, the education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience working together of key management and technical personnel.  This criterion is primarily concerne d with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion.  Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications in these primary disciplines, which are listed in descendi ng order of importance.  List professional registrations for the disciplines: (a) Environmental engineering; (b) Chemical process engineering; (c) Chemistry; (d) Risk Assessment; (e) Hydrogeology; (f) Civil Engineering; (g) Geotechnical engineering; (h) In dustrial hygiene; (i) Health physics; (j) Cost engineering; (k) Geology; (l) Archaeology; (m) Mechanical engineering; (n) Electrical engineering; (o) Architecture/Landscape Planning.  (3) Past Performance [FAR 36.602-1(a)(4)].  ACASS is the primary source of information on past performance.  ACASS will be queried for all firms submitting a proposal.  When deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered.  The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from ACASS.  The board will consider the relevancy of each perf ormance evaluation to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance.  A firm that has earned excellent evaluations on recent DoD A-E  contracts for similar projects will be ranked relatively high on past performance.  (4) Capacity [FAR 36.602-1(a)(3)].  The board will consider a firm's availa ble capacity of key disciplines to perform work in the required time.  The board will also consider the prime firm and its consultants in the offices proposed to perform the work in relationship to the firms' current workloads.  Greatest weight is on proje ct resources located in or near EPA Region II.  (5) Knowledge Of The Locality [FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)].  The board will evaluate a firm's familiarity with local conditions.  Examples include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the state and local regula tory agencies, geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.  Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their c apabilities to serve projects located in both EPA Region II and the USACE Northwestern Division.  Greatest weight is on ability to serve projects located in EPA Region II.  (B) Secondary Selection Criteria.  The following secondary criteria will not be app lied by a pre-selection board, if one is needed, and will only be used by a selection board as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms.  The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in any type of scoring or evaluation system.  The secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance: (1) SB and SDB Participation [DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(C)].  The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HB CU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the great the participation, the g reater the consideration.  Large businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  For informational purposes, the small business size is define d by the limits of NAICS Code 541330. (2) Volume of DoD Contract Awards [DFARS 236.602-1(a)(6)(A)].  The overall most highly qualified firms will not be rejected solely in the interest of equitable distribution of contracts.  Responding firms should cite a ll contract numbers, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months.  Please indicate all Task Orders and Modifications awarded your firm by DoD agencies within the last twelve (12) months under an ind efinite delivery type contract.  Indicate date of Task Orders and fee for each.  (4).  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit five (5) copies of their SF330 to the address listed no later than clo se of business [4:00 P.M. (CST)] on 12 October 2005.  Copies of the SF 330, Part II, for the prime firm and all consultants shall be included in the SF330.  Include the firm's ACASS number in SF330, Section H, and describe the firm's overall Quality Manage ment Plan.  Section H is limited to twenty (20) pages with double-sided sheets counting as two pages.  For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. Font.

<DESC>NOTE:  Potential changes to the PROS III Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8630-04-R-5063 The USG is considering amending the PROS III RFP to limit the contractor’s  financial liability for latent defect Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) to 10  years (3 year basic period of performance and 2 year option period with a 5  year administrative closeout period.  The USG is attempting to provide the  contractor financial relief by placing a limit on latent defect liability. The  contractor will remain financially liable for the resolution and/or closure of  all other valid SDRs as discussed below.   Currently, the PROS III RFP requires the contractor to be financially liable  for all valid SDRs, including latent defects, from cradle to grave, which  means until the SDRs are resolved or closed.  The contractor must conduct a  thorough and detailed investigation of the SDRs within the USG timelines to  determine the precise cause of the discrepancy and submit the investigation  results along with supporting documentation and a recommendation of validity  to the USG in order for the USG to make the final determination of SDR  validity.  The contractor shall repair, replace or provide credit for all  valid SDRs as a means of resolution or closure.   The USG is requesting a response from ALL interested and capable PROS III  offerors.

We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

<DESC>NOTE:  Potential changes to the PROS III Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8630-04-R-5063 The USG is considering amending the PROS III RFP to limit the contractor’s  financial liability for latent defect Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) to 10  years (3 year basic period of performance and 2 year option period with a 5  year administrative closeout period).  The USG is attempting to provide the  contractor financial relief by placing a limit on latent defect liability. The  contractor will remain financially liable for the resolution and/or closure of  all other valid SDRs as discussed below.   Currently, the PROS III RFP requires the contractor to be financially liable  for all valid SDRs, including latent defects, from cradle to grave, which  means until the SDRs are resolved or closed.  The contractor must conduct a  thorough and detailed investigation of the SDRs within the USG timelines to  determine the precise cause of the discrepancy and submit the investigation  results along with supporting documentation and a recommendation of validity  to the USG in order for the USG to make the final determination of SDR  validity.  The contractor shall repair, replace or provide credit for all  valid SDRs as a means of resolution or closure.   The USG is requesting a response from ALL interested and capable PROS III  offerors.  If the above changes were made to the subject RFP, would your  company submit a proposal in response to the PROS III RFP?

Correspondence may be sent by post to Mr. Dinwoody at the following address: James Dinwoody AFSAC/PKP 1822 Van Patton Dr. Bldg. 210 Front Wright Patterson, OH  45433-5337 NOTE: Our customers are concerned with maintaining visibility and accuracy of  shipped assets.   We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

Subject:  Draft RFP HM1576-05-R-0003 (Human Development Technology and Services (HDT&S)
 
Dear Potential Offerors
 
The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Human Development (HD) Directorate mission is to attract, develop and retain a world-class Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) workforce.  NGA’s strategy is to align and integrate the various HD services to successfully accomplish the mission.  Currently, HD service functions are provided through several individual contract support vehicles which provide a full range of human development support.  

The HD strategy outlined in the draft RFP will unify these efforts in a new HD Support Program along functional lines. At this time, the planned functional elements will include: Human Capital Management (HMC); Learning Management Services (LMS); Program Management; Corporate Health and Wellness; Drug Testing Services; and Organizational Development.  NGA’s strategy is to procure these efforts through full and open competition for HCM and LMS, and through small business set-aside competition for Program Management, Corporate Health and Wellness, Drug Testing Services, and Organizational Development.

This letter offers potential offerors the opportunity to provide written comments on the early draft RFP documents in support of the full and open competition for HCM and LMS.  Draft documents for the small business set-aside functional areas will be released at a later date and will provide an opportunity for comments as well.  The early draft documents include the draft Performance Work Statement, dated 6 September 2005, entitled “National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Human Development Technology and Services (HDT&S)”, and Draft RFP Sections B, C, L, and M. These documents are available for your review/comment at https://www.fedteds.gov.  We want to stress the fact that NGA is looking for feedback to improve the final RFP.  Your comments to NGA as the result of this early draft are requested and will be greatly appreciated.

Both HCM and LMS will be competed under a single solicitation document. Offeror’s are encouraged to propose on one or both efforts.  Section L requires separate proposals for each functional area. The Government reserves the right to award a separate contract for each functional area.  The Government contemplates awarding hybrid-type contracts to include Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Award Fee and Cost Reimbursable type contract provisions.  The estimated performance period is from date of award (anticipated at 29 March 2006) for twelve months, with four (4) option years (5 years total).   

Potential offerors should submit written questions to HDT&S@nga.mil by 09 September 2005.   To the maximum extent practicable, we expect to have answers at the pre-solicitation conference for those questions submitted by 09 September 2005.  A pre-solicitation conference will be conducted on 13 September 2005 from 8:00 a.m. until 15:00 p.m. at the Mission Partner Facility (MPF), 14520 Avion Parkway, Suite 120, Chantilly, VA  20151.  Further instructions regarding the pre-solicitation conference are posted at https://www.fedteds.gov/.  We encourage participants to submit written questions as they are generated.  Potential offerors will be provided an opportunity to submit written questions at the conference and after the conference.    NGA will accept written comments through 19 September 2005.  To facilitate all potential offerors, all briefings presented during pre-solicitation conference and all questions and answers will be posted to the website https://www.fedteds.gov/ on or about 21 September 2005.  Offerors are reminded that the FedTeDS website will be the primary tool to communicate with industry.  NGA will post a notice of release of the final RFP through www.fedbizopps.gov, however, changes or additions to documents will be posted directly to FedTeDS may not be announced through the www.fedbizopps.gov.  Please be advised that it is the sole responsibility of prospective offerors to check the FedTeDS site regularly in order to remain current with posted information.

The following tentative milestone schedule is being provided to facilitate planning.  Changes to the schedule may occur as needed. Updated schedule information will be posted on www.fedteds.gov/.

RFP Release   		24 October   2005
Proposals Due       	23 November 2005

All written questions concerning this solicitation shall be submitted in writing via the email address HDT&S@nga.mil.  To ensure that all offerors have access to the same information, the Government will only entertain written questions.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334510 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The VRE Reconstruction Engine will be used with existing 3T human MRI system.  It is essential to maintain the 3T MRI system at the leading-edge of technology with timely upgrades and enhancements to critical components.  Acquisition of the proposed item will allow ultra high-resolution, anatomical and high duty-cycle, functional MRI data to be acquired and reconstructed in real-time.  Receiver subsystem of the 3T scanner was upgraded to a 16 channel system.  As a result, the scanner can now generate image data at a very high rate.  The VRE reconstruction engine upgrade will allow realtime processing of large amounts of data making very high-resolution anatomical and functional MRI studies routine.  Upgrades must be capable of meeting the following specifications:  1) based on four (4) dual 2.2Ghz AMD Opteron 248 chipsets, 2)be able to process 8-channel, ASSET(X2) EPI fMRI 128X128 matrix image data acquired at 14 frames per second for 5 minutes without any delay at the end acquisition and, 3) reconstruction engine should be capable of interfacing with the existing 3T MRI system.  GE Healthcare is the only known manufacturer to the NINDS researcher that can meet required upgrades for existing system.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS to determine if the party can provide the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m., EDT, September 19, 2005.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Renita Smith, Contract Specialist, at smithren@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number RFQ-NCI-50185-NA must be stated on all correspondence.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Preclinical Development Facility for Medical Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NS-05-012
<RESPDATE>091905
<ARCHDATE>10042005
<CONTACT>Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email braunh@ninds.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is exploring the market interest and capabilities relating to preclinical studies of new or improved pharmaceutical preparations to be used as medical countermeasures against chemical agents that could be used in a terrorist attack.  As a first step, the Institute is attempting to identify expert sources to conduct safety, pharmacokinetic/biodistribution, and developmental chemistry studies with candidate drugs.   

Background 
The increased risk of a terrorist attack in the U.S. involving chemical agents has created new challenges for many departments and agencies across the federal government. Within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the NIH is leading the development of new and improved therapeutics designed to treat the conditions caused by potential chemical agents of terrorism. The NIH Chemical Threats program is part of the larger biodefense program coordinated by the NIAID that includes Biological and Radiation/Nuclear threats. 

Our intent is to fund a preclinical testing facility that will conduct safety, pharmacokinetic/biodistribution, and developmental chemistry studies with candidate drugs. The preclinical testing facility will not conduct any efficacy studies with drugs, or any studies with the chemical agents themselves. Candidate drugs that will be tested in this facility will have been previously shown to be efficacious by studies conducted within other NINDS programs that utilize models for, or actual, chemical agents.    Candidate drugs will be supplied to the contractor by the NINDS.   

Requirements
This facility would provide several functions:  

1.	conduct cGLP absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, including PK/PD studies, in a range of animal species for candidate drugs; 
2.	conduct cGLP toxicology safety studies for candidate drugs;
3.	conduct cGMP optimization and control studies including synthesis, composition, formulation and packaging, and stability;
4.	prepare study reports and recommendations for countermeasure modification if necessary. 

Types of potential facilities

A)	ADME Tox (numbers 1 and 2 above)
B)	Developmental Chemistry (number 3 only)
C)	Facility capable of both A) and B)

Information Requested
Information in the following areas will aid in the design of solicitations for a preclinical test facility. The information supplied in any response to this request should address, but not be limited to, the following (Three Page Limit): 

1.	One paragraph introductory description of general background and research interest related to this program. 
2.	Summary of capabilities and resources related to items 1-5 listed above.  
3.	Quality of the scientific and infrastructure capabilities in support of this program, including GLP and cGMP. 
4.	Whether you are a Type A, B, or C facility as described above.
5.	Other comments and suggestion on the general program outline given above.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government’s use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government’s evaluation of the information received. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any proprietary information should be so marked. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business or organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other non-profit organization.

Responses should be identified with RFI No. NS-05-012, and are due by September 19, 2005. Please submit three (3) copies of your response, to Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, Contracts Management Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Room 3287, Bethesda, MD 20892-9531 (For Fedex or courier, use: Rockville, MD 20852).

<DESC>***Responses due 4:00 pm EST September 12, 2005.  No further information about this potential requirement will be made available in this RFI.  Per the RFI, “THE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 3 PAGES”.***   

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (SOURCES SOUGHT) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. THE RFI IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM 8(a) VENDORS OUTLINING HOW THEY CAN SATISFY THE GOVERNMENTS NEEDS FOR AN 8(a) COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION.  THE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 3 PAGES AND PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE VENDOR'S ORGANIZATION (BIO); TEAMING AGREEMENTS; RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND RISK; AND SUGGESTIONS.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM POTENTIAL 8(a) MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ JOINT VENTURES AND TEAMING PARTNERSHIPS ARE ENCOURAGED.  The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the Department of State seeks to issue an 8(a) competitive procurement on behalf of the Bureau of Resource Management, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services (RM/GFS) to assist the Department in its effort to provide financial services in support of overseas and domestic operations at the Global Financial Services (GFS) in Charleston, SC.  These services include Disbursing, Accounting, Payroll, Payments, and operations in support of these activities, including services related to the operation and maintenance of local area networks, maintenance of installed systems supporting automated financial systems and systems analysis, user support and training related to installed automated financial systems, and other related services.  These activities currently employ approximately 300 full time personnel.  Labor categories will include program management, financial, information technology, and administrative services.  The Department desires to award a single contract for this support to GFS Charleston.  The contract will primarily focus on the GFS Charleston, but support services will be needed by other RM Bureau organizations.  Therefore, the Washington DC metropolitan area will be a secondary place of performance, with a projected 5% of the total contract requirement designated for Washington area RM Bureau usage.  Therefore the vendor must have or establish a facility in the Charleston Metro area.  There will be a need for contractor personnel to travel between Charleston, SC and the Washington DC metro area (DC, MD, VA), as well as some overseas travel.  The Department seeks from 8(a) vendors capability statements outlining how they are able to meet the Department's need for this support services requirement.   This Request for Information (Sources Sought) offers the opportunity for 8(a) vendors to present a capability statement and teaming agreement to shows their qualification on meeting RM's needs for support services.  Currently the Department intends to offer this opportunity to all 8(a) vendors capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.  Vendors should indicate their General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract number, if applicable. Indicate size (e.g. number of client sites, related contract(s) or project(s), dollar value of each contract or project, scope), and teaming agreements. (3 pages) Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé joint ventures and teaming partnerships are encouraged.  Review of vendor responses and information exchange meeting(s): The Government will review submissions to ascertain the relevance to the RM environment and goals.  Subsequent to review of vendor responses to the RFI, the Department may at its discretion hold technical information exchange meeting(s) with respondents. The meeting(s) will focus on industry experiences related to development, technical solutions, best practices and lessons learned, risks and programmatic benefits.  Also, potential bidders may be asked to travel to Charleston for a capability briefing.  Disclaimer: This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and can not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Department makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing and publishing this market survey. Vendor submission of responses and contact information: Electronic responses to this Request for Information are required. Please submit responses via email in Microsoft Word or Adobe pdf format no later than 4:00 pm EST on Monday, September 12, 2005, to: BaraneEJ@state.gov. Please contact Edward Baran via email with questions related to this RFI. No telephone calls please.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "Teaming Opportunities for the Earth Systems Science Pathfinder Program" (ESSP)" #SS-NNL05ESSP which was posted on August 24, 2005. You are notified that the following changes are made:  The page limit for responses to this partnering synopsis is revised as follows: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages for each mission element identified as 2 through 7 (Mission Management, Spacecraft and Launch Options, Mission Operations, Payload Operations, Science data Processing, and Education and Public Outreach).  Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages for each proposed instrument under the element identified as 1 (Science Instrumentation).  Responses shall address each of the aforementioned evlaution criteria.	Resumes of key personnel and a cover page that clearly identifies the mission element or Science Instrument addressed by the response do not count against the total allocated page count. The following questions were received and answers are provided to further clarify the synopsis as follows:   Q1. The relevant experience evaluation criterion requests resumes of key personnel. Our company staff is large and we have many experienced staff members capable of leading and performing the tasks for which we have chosen to offer responses. Since the ESSP AO release date has a very large uncertainty and is well over a year away, it is impossible for us (and likely any company) to indicate in advance which personnel will be available. We assume that resumes illustrating the applicable skills of potential personnel are acceptable. A1. The preparation for an ESSP proposal begins substantially before the issuance of a solicitation.   Partner selection will be made by LaRC based on the criteria stated in the synopsis which includes availability of key personnel.  The synopsis describes the roles of partners selected under this Teaming Opportunity: “selected teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal development process”.	The naming of key personnel who would be committed in the proposal development process and thereafter (if a contract is awarded for selected partner effort) is part of the evaluation criteria.      Q2. The Mission Management task element implies that the personnel providing such services are located on site with the PI at LaRC. Is this the intent or can mission management support be provided off-site with regular visits to the PI, supplemented with frequent telecons, videocons, and electronic document and mail exchanges between visits? A2. The mission management function is highly integrated with the science leadership of NASA missions.	Recent past performance in effectively managing (geographically) distributed teams is an indication that this task element can be performed from a location other than LaRC.   Q3. Does participation in the Mission Management task element preclude participation in other task elements? For example, would the management partner be prohibited from supplying instrument support or the spacecraft bus because of conflict with performance review responsibilities under the Management element? A3. The mission management function does not preclude participation in any other of the six mission elements listed in the synopsis.   Q4. The solicitation describes six instrument types, each of which could be an ESSP mission candidate. Information on the instrument packages (size, mass, power, etc.) is not provided. The Spacecraft and Launch Options element requests information on co-manifest launch options and secondary payload opportunities. The former requires data on the package parameters (if only enveloping values), while the latter is dependent on the launch date (i.e., AO release and instrument development schedule), and both depend on the launch vehicle type and primary payload orbit. Please clarify your expected response. Are independent launch scenarios (i.e., observatory on its own dedicated vehicle) not under consideration? A4. Independent launch scenarios may be an acceptable option for ESSP missions.  Final requirements are yet to be finalized.  The synopsis does not request a specific concept for co-manifest or secondary payload accommodation for ESSP-4.	Rather, the synopsis requests recent relevant performance in identifying and/or implementing such opportunities for other missions as evidence of the capability to provide such services for ESSP-4 missions.  We would expect responses to describe relevant recent technical and cost performance in terms of mission specifics: mission name; power, mass, volume, and data rate envelopes; spacecraft characteristics; launch vehicle used: special engineering, analysis, or mission design services or facilities provided: and other characteristics as appropriate to demonstrate capability to develop concepts, conduct tradeoffs, estimate time and delivery, and other functions that are the responsibility of the spacecraft and/or launch element mission partners. Q5. We expect that LaRC will receive many responses to each element. The solicitation does not describe how acceptable responses are paired with the proposed ESSP missions. For example, several contractors could provide spacecraft services. The solicitation does not provide sufficient data for conceptual spacecraft designs to be proposed at this time, so LaRC cannot evaluate how effectively the contractors would be able to accommodate the final instrument configurations. Will there be another round of responses requested from acceptable vendors to make the final team selections? Is the present solicitation just to identify a list of acceptable sources who would then be solicited to submit RFIs or proposals to the LaRC mission team(s) going forward with ESSP proposals? A5. We do not anticipate issuing another teaming opportunity synopsis to seek prospective partners.   NASA LaRC is looking for the “best” partners to team with in developing our proposal(s) and refining our requirements.  If the LaRC and partner proposal(s) are selected under the Headquarters AO process, the partner would perform the proposed effort as further defined in a resultant contract.  It is anticipated that the AO will be open to other Government Agencies, industry, academia and FFRDCs.  You will also be free to propose directly to the AO.   Q6. Do you require the 1.57um laser system to be used for spectroscopic measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide?   A6.Yes.  The lidar is intended to measure atmospheric CO2.   The due date for responses is not extended. All other information remains unchanged.

<SOLNBR>09-30-2005-HBL
<RESPDATE>093005

<CONTACT>Dr. Marc S. Allen, Director of Advanced Programs, Phone (202) 358-0733, Fax (202) 358-4118, Email marc.allen@nasa.gov
<DESC>Statement of Purpose The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks a no-exchange-of-funds collaboration with an organization that produces, markets, and/or distributes aerospace technical or scientific information for the purpose of disseminating results of recent advanced concept studies on possible future NASA space science missions. NASA is interested in reviewing proposals from organizations that are familiar with NASA's mission, values, and goals, and that could enhance the Agency's ability to disseminate information on these studies to the professional space science and space systems engineering communities.  The one-year studies whose results NASA is interested in disseminating were initiated in mid-2004, and focus on science missions (“Vision Missions”) that could be candidates for implementation by NASA for flight in the post-2013 timeframe.  There are 15 mission studies in all, spanning the full range of space science areas: space astronomy, solar system exploration, and solar and heliospheric science.  Abstracts of the advanced studies in question are provided in:	        http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/NRA-03-OSS-01-VM/winners.html	 Additional information about the scope of the studies is available in the original competitive solicitation for the studies:   http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/nra-03-oss-01/appendA4_2.html	 The document to be disseminated will include results summaries of some or all of the 15 studies conducted.  In addition to electronic distribution, NASA is seeking dissemination in the form of bound books, preferably both to an established circulation and through active marketing.  NASA is contemplating entering into a collaboration with a single partner via a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization.  The collaboration will be structured on a no-exchange-of-funds basis; NASA will receive paper copies of the volume (number to be established in the partnership agreement) at no cost, and the partner will be permitted to market additional copies through its customary channels and practices.  NASA will retain a Government purpose license in the delivered manuscript and in any published version of the manuscript (electronic or hardcopy). Benefits to Collaborating Partner NASA will deliver a technically edited manuscript, projected at 400-600 pages including illustrations, to the selected partner.  In exchange for the partner’s investment to electronically distribute and print the volume and actively market it, the partner will retain the proceeds of this distribution.  Evaluation Criteria Proposals must demonstrate the following to be considered: •	Submitting organization must be a recognized source of high quality information products within the professional aerospace or space science communities •	Submitting organization must have established processes for electronic and hardcopy distribution of scientific and technical information to the broad community of users of this kind of information If these threshold requirements are met, NASA may enter into an agreement with the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the government based on these three factors: 1.	Approach to electronic distribution of the provided document, and corresponding extent of its expected electronic distribution based on established processes or past experience with similar products 2.	Anticipated distribution of hardcopy volumes via preestablished subscriptions or other existing mechanism(s) 3.	Anticipated additional distribution of hardcopy units through active marketing, including an explanation of the basis for projections based on past experience with similar items The proposal and the proposed method of dissemination must be consistent with applicable NASA statutes, policy, and regulations.  Proposal Requirements This request will be open for 21 calendar days following the date of release of this announcement. Response to this Request for Information is strictly voluntary. This Request is not to be construed as a commitment by NASA, nor will NASA pay for the information submitted. Any questions regarding this request should be directed to the point of contact identified below.  Submittals should be limited to a cover letter and no more than four (4) pages double-spaced, with 1" margins using Times New Roman 12-point type. Submission via hardcopy or fax must be received at the address indicated below by 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on September 30, 2005, to be considered. Proposals hand-carried or delivered by commercial courier must arrive at NASA Headquarters at the address below. Notification of faxed responses should be provided to the Point of Contact below via telephone or email at the telephone number or email address provided below.  Respondents will be sent an acknowledgement of the receipt of their materials by email if an email address for this purpose is provided by the responder.

In accordance with Part 19, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns in a small business class and the award will be made at fair market prices for a set-aside to be appropriate.  In this particular case the government is trying to ascertain if there are four responsible concerns classified as 8(a) s, or HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned small business and small business.  In order for this determination to be made, we require additional information to improve our understanding of interested small business concerns' capabilities.

Please give a brief response to the questions below, and limit your response to 7 pages.  We are not requesting technical/management proposals.  Your response will be used solely as part of our market research efforts.

	a.  Do you intend to bid as a prime contractor on this effort, and can your company perform the majority of the effort?

Requested information should be key and specific to the procurement but also prudent and reasonable in terms of necessary data and time required to respond.

3.  This information will be used only for market research purposes and will not be used as a part of proposal evaluation later.

Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

Only SGI possesses the knowledge of the WRF to provide the necessary tools in the time frame required.  This comes from their expertise in benchmarking for the potential host platforms by their current participation in WRF development.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

SCOPE OF WORK

TITLE:  Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for Underway and Moored Current Profiling in Shallow Water

Background

The United Stated Environmental Protection Agency’s National Health and Environmental Effect Research Laboratory – Gulf Ecology Division is engaged research projects in Gulf of Mexico estuaries and on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico which require measurements of current velocity profiles using an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP).
EPA recognizes that due to the nature of underwater acoustics and available ADCP technology, the optimal ADCP instrument depends critically on the intended application, especially water depth, desired resolution, and mode of deployment that will be used.  EPA seeks an instrument to profile currents in inshore waters from 2 to 15 m depth.  Our expectations reflect our knowledge that range, vertical bin size, temporal resolution, and velocity resolution depend in part on operational parameters and that optimizing for one of these parameters will have an effect on values of the other parameters.

Specifications

The vendor shall provide equipment including all associated software, cables, and other equipment needed to meet the specifications described below.

The ADCP shall:
•	operate at 1200 kHz or similar frequency able to meet the other specifications.
•	have the capability to profile currents in water depths up to 15 m.
•	have the capability of resolving currents in shallow waters (<15 m) at a bin size of 0.25 m or less.
•	resolve currents in 3-dimensions
•	provide error velocity measurements to facilitate QA/QC
•	have bottom tracking capability for use on an underway research vessel
•	have a battery pack capable of running the ADCP as a self-powered instrument
•	be equipped with at least 64 MB of internal memory 
•	be equipped with a pressure sensor
•	be able to employ high rate pinging to improve current velocity resolution in shallow waters
•	be capable of resolving currents with a single-ping standard deviation of less than 8.7 cm/s at a vertical resolution of 0.5 m over a water depth of 15 m. 
•	be capable of resolving currents using high rate pinging at a temporal resolution of 10 seconds or less with standard deviation of less than 1.5 cm/s at a 0.25 m interval in a water depth of 15 m.

The post-processing / real-time processing software shall:

•	employ a graphical user interface to communicate with and/or operate the ADCP 
•	operate on a Windows 2000 or XP platform
•	provide real-time current velocity data, including along-transect profiles of current velocity during underway sampling.

The vendor shall supply software to assist planning ADCP deployments so that operational parameters can be easily set to achieve deployment objectives.

The vendor shall supply a 25 m data cable to connect the ADCP to a computer platform.

The following provisions apply:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request For Quote (RFQ) Number is NAMA-05-Q-0031. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03 effective April 11, 2005. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions for this procurement.

1.0	Background

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  Within NARA the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) works toward the goal of improving the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of NARA operations.  To that end and pursuant to the IG Act of 1978, as amended, (5 U.S.C. App. 3), the OIG conducts audits and investigations, both criminal and investigative, relating to all aspects of NARA operations to promote efficiency and prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.

Currently the Office of Investigations within NARA’s OIG is utilizing several systems for tracking the various aspects of investigations.  These systems are not integrated, requiring multiple manual entries of redundant data, as well as manual compilation/calculation of data for management reporting.  Initially all complaints are entered into one system where they are evaluated to determine if there is a need for further investigation.  If further investigation is required the information is manually re-entered into another system for conducting the investigation.  Additional supporting information such as letters, emails, and other electronic or paper documents are stored separately in electronic archive folders or paper files.  These systems include commercial and custom desktop database applications, word-processing document archives, document logs, and paper based logs.

2.0	Objective and Tasks

The systems currently in use by the Office of Investigations are not effective or efficient.  They require many manual steps especially in the preparation of the Semi Annual reports to Congress, Quarterly reports to the Archivist, as well as numerous monthly management reporting and oversight activities.  Case data is not easily accessible from a single location, and accuracy can be compromised due to redundant data entry and multiple storage locations.  The OIG is anticipating that the number of cases will increase significantly over the next 1 to 2 years due to an increase in pro-active investigations.   In light of these anticipated increases and in an effort to increase efficiency and accuracy the OIG would like replace the current systems with a single investigative case management system to process, track and report on all complaints and cases.    To that end, NARA requires contract services to configure and implement a commercially established Case Management System (CMS) to meet the information technology (IT) needs of NARA’s Office of Investigations for up to seven users.

Statement of Objectives:

Provide remote backup of FedSource/U.S. Treasury (see fedsource.gov website) servers and continuity of operations due to emergency, disaster, or contingency events.

FedSource Baltimore requires that their business and customer support initiatives continue, non-stop, even in the event of a catastrophic event that would shut down, inactivate, or destroy existing office space located in the city of Baltimore, Maryland.   FedSource Baltimore requires a contingent disaster recovery capability, with its associated disaster recovery services, to maintain its current business operations.  The contingency program must consist of access to an office facility during a disaster, with on line, database, and communications in place, associated disaster notification services, and routine site tests.   Contractor should also be able to provide disaster recovery services and business continuity consulting to assist FedSource in understanding and providing for their recovery needs. The pre-positioning of supplies at the contingency location is required.


Disaster Contingency Capability:

Access to a contingency disaster recovery capability is required immediately after a contingent disaster event (max. delay is two hours after FedSource contacts contractor declaring a disaster and the need for the capability).  For the purposes for of this requirement, a contingency or disaster is defined to be an event over which FedSource has no control that causes FedSource to lose access to its facility located at 31 Hopkins Plaza, Suite1600, Baltimore, MD, 21201-2806, such as, for example and without limitation, fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, act of terror, act of war, etc. 


Instantaneous access to the contingency capability during a disaster or emergency with some capability to expand operations to include establishing more permanent space should FedSource suffer a complete loss of their current office space. 

Twenty-four hour access to a 20 seat Contingency Capability during a declared disaster as defined herein, and to provide for remote backup of four (4) FedSource servers.   Contingency capability should include the following abilities:

·	To backup, store, and retrieve all application transactions and database files offsite from the FedSource Baltimore environment on a daily basis.
·	To have an off-site server infrastructure that FedSource can access if the servers at the FedSource Baltimore location fail to work.
·	To have office space, server/desktop infrastructure that can support up to 20 FedSource staff for up to 6 months in the event that the Baltimore FedSource office becomes non-accessible.
·	The location/capability must be within a 15 mile radius of Baltimore City and must be within close proximity to public transportation.

In addition to providing FedSource-Baltimore access to the Contingency Capability within the specified time, Contractor agrees to provide FedSource-Baltimore access to and use of on-line computer workstations at the Contingency Capability equipped with:
a.	Computer 
b.	Internet access
c.	Telephones
d.	Fax service, copiers, and printers

Both contractor and FedSource will work together with due diligence to integrate software and date backup/restore requirements with the Contingency Capability site. Contractor will act with promptness and diligence to provide FedSource-Baltimore access to FedSource-Baltimore’s software and data as soon as reasonably practicable given the circumstances.

<DESC>The Northern Right Whale is among the most endangered large whales in the world with a population size of approximately 340 animals. Human activities including commercial fishing and shipping are a major threat to the survival of this species. There have been several right whale mortalities due to collisions with large vessels during the last three years. In 2004 alone there were three mortalities of pregnant female right whales that were likely associated with vessel strikes. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is currently developing a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of fatal collisions between right whales and vessel traffic along the U.S. Atlantic coast. 
While there have been several ship strike mortalities in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region between Georgia and New Jersey, there is relatively little information on the seasonal spatial distribution and abundance of right whales in this area. This critical gap in knowledge reduces NMFS’ ability to develop strategies to mitigate vessel collisions. During FY2004 and FY2005, NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) conducted preliminary research to deploy passive acoustic monitoring buoys along the U.S. mid-Atlantic to document the seasonal presence of right whales in this area. Results from these studies indicated the presence of right whales in this area during the late winter and early spring and demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool for monitoring right whale habitat use. 
During the fall and winter of 2005-2006 NMFS/SEFSC is continuing this research project to use passive hydroacoustic buoys to monitor for the presence of the North Atlantic Right Whale in shallow continental shelf waters of the mid-Atlantic Bight. This contract will provide vessel support for the deployment and recovery of monitoring buoys. 
Description of Work 
This contract is for vessel services during the recovery and redeployment of 18 passive hydroacoustic buoys in the mid-Atlantic between Cape Fear, North Carolina and Savannah, GA. This mission will employ an oceanographic research vessel at least 65 feet in length. The contractor will provide vessel and operational support for the deployment and recovery of passive hydroacoustic buoys and associated mooring materials. The contractor will supply raw materials and construction of 18 mooring anchors and associated hardware. These anchors consist of scrap metal, chain, and various fasteners used to attach the buoy to the sea floor and prevent equipment loss due to wind and wave action. NMFS will provide acoustic monitoring buoys and technical support aboard the charter vessel to attach the buoys to the moorings, verify their performance, and assist in recovery and deployment.  Due to shallow water, strong currents, and expected high wave action during the deployment of these buoys, it is necessary to deploy them with a significant (>300 lbs.) amount of anchoring material. Diver support is necessary to recover the buoys by manually releasing them from their moorings. 
The buoys will be deployed at locations designated by NMFS. We anticipate deploying three sets of three buoys each along an offshore-onshore transect crossing the bathymetry near Cape Fear, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. The first deployment will be of nine buoys during the later half of November, 2005. These buoys will be recovered during late-February, 2006 and another nine buoys will be deployed at the same locations. The final recovery operation of these buoys will occur during late April, 2006. 
Contract Deliverables 
The contractor will provide mooring materials and will assist in deployment and recovery of two sets of 9 passive acoustic monitoring buoys. Precise locations of the buoys at each deployment will be recorded so as to ensure recovery after a 3 month deployment period. The contractor will provide all vessel and logistic support required to achieve successful deployment and recovery of these buoys. 
Conditions of Purchase Order 
The contractor will be paid by invoice following the completion of each deployment/recovery mission period. The purchase order will pay for vessel time and operational expenses, staff expenses, expendable materials, and equipment costs. 
Assumption of Risk and Additional Costs 
The contractor will assume liability for additional unplanned operational costs incurred due to mechanical failures or weather conditions. The recovery and deployment operations should be planned during periods where there is a high expectation of weather conditions that will allow the successful recovery and/or deployment of the buoys. 
Evaluation of Potential Sources 
Potential sources for this contract will be evaluated on the following criteria: 
I. Operational capability and experience 
1) Vessel capability: The vessel must be stationed in the U.S. Atlantic to minimize transit times between the home port and deployment locations. The vessel must be capable of multi-day offshore operations with a minimum operational range of 500 miles. Vessel size must be at least 65 feet in length and rated for offshore work in inclement weather and berthing space for at least 2 scientists beyond the crew and divers. The vessel must have GPS positioning equipment that will allow precise tracking of deployment locations to insure recovery of the buoys. Finally, the vessel must have winches allowing the deployment of anchoring material and buoys exceeding 400 pounds in weight. 
2) Dive Recovery Operation Support: The contractor must be able to provide experienced divers that have the capability to dive in turbid waters at night to recover the buoys that are attached to the sea floor. The vessel must have experience and capability to safely support these dive operations. 
3) Moorings: The contractor must be able to provide scrap metal, chain, and other required materials and construct appropriate moorings that will reduce the probability of losing moored buoys due to wave action. 
4) Availability: The timing of deployment and recovery missions is critical to match both the timing of the right whale migration and the operational lifetime of the moored buoys. The vessel must be available for missions during mid- to late November 2005, mid-February 2006, and mid- to late April 2006. The vessel schedule should be flexible enough to allow alternative dates (within the same general time frame) to account for variable weather conditions. 
5) Experience Deploying and Recovering Moored Equipment: The contractor must demonstrate a history of successful operations to deploy anchored oceanographic equipment and successfully recovering that equipment after long deployments (> 60 days) in the shallow continental shelf waters of the U.S. Atlantic.

(b) Options. Option prices will be included for evaluation purposes only and will not obligate the Government to exercise the options.

http://www.usaid.gov/in/working_with_us/grant_opportunity.htm

THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF QUOTES/OFFERS IS NOT EXTENDED.
       
RFQ 386-05-023 Amendment # 2 

 
Q.1)  What is the size(s) of the grant(s) we would be auditing
      India - annual size of grants up for review
      Sri Lanka - annual size of grants up for review.
 
RESPONSE: Any Value is possible. 
 
2)    How many grants are involved?
      Are they all funded by USAID?
      Are there any other agencies involved?
 
RESPONSE: This Solicitation may result in more than one BPA, e.g. multiple firms hired to conduct financial review. During the course of a year USAID expects to require approximately 4 to 6 financial reviews. However the true number of contracts or grants for review will vary. 
 
Secondly, yes they are all funded by USAID organization and firms.
 
Thirdly, no other US or non-US Agencies are involved. 
  
3)    As far as reviewing the system for internal controls are we 
considering OMB Circular A-123
 
RESPONSE: Yes, the assessment will cover USAID/India’s system for internal 
control as per OMB Circular-123.  
 
4)    Are we to use U.S. based accounting principals or International 
based accounting principals?
 
RESPONSE:  Both.
 
5)    What is the period of time under review? Current or previous 
Fiscal year
 
RESPONSE: Period under review will generally be the most recent fiscal or prior year of the contractor (firm) or recipient (NGO). In some instances, for the purposes of limited financial reviews the current fiscal year may be evaluated.
 
6)    How many finance/recipients in India / Sri Lanka are there and 
are each to be reviewed separately?
 
RESPONSE:  USAID maintains a total portfolio currently valued at more than US$200 million. Most of that is subject to US-based auditing. However a minority portion is with non-US firms and NGOs. Those organizations are the primary, though not exclusive focus of this Solicitation. As stated in response the question number two USAID has a limited (specific) view of the expected scale of the workload. 
 
7)    How many locations of USAID in India are to be reviewed?
 
RESPONSE:  Generally in New Delhi and possibily scattered all over India and Sri Lanka will need to be visited for a financial review.  
 


RFQ 386-05-023 Amendment # 2 


8)    Would there be any consideration of going [U.S.-based] 8a on this RFP?
 
RESPONSE:  No special consideration will be given. Given the unique specifics of this requirement non-US firms are eligible to propose.
 
9)    Has this work been done before and is there an actual report 
available for review?
 
RESPONSE: Yes see link http://wwww.usaid.gov/in/working_withus/grant_opportunity.htm
      Annexure 4 “reference sample document” of past report.
 
10)   Do travel expenses need to be estimated in the proposal.
 
RESPONSE: Please Refer to A.6 TRAVEL on page 10 of the BPA RFQ. Government will reimburse Travel expenses at actuals subject to maximum USAID Per Diem rate as applicabe for travel in foreign areas[ refer US Department of State link http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/prdm/] All other direct costs and indirect cost rates stand separately.
      
11)   Place of performance - Is it going to be in India and or 
Sri Lanka.
 
RESPONSE: Generally speaking mostly in India, some in Sri Lanka and on very rare occasions in the Maldives or other South Asia locations. 
 
12)   The grant amount to be audited and the audit/grant period.
 
RESPONSE: This is not for Audit (as per A-133). This is primarily for limited
financial reviews of grants amounting to $300,000 or below in a fiscal year.    
 
13)   Have there being any pre-award audits or interim audits done
 
RESPONSE:  No, this is not an applicable question per se in the view of USAID.

<SUBJECT>66--Carbon Fiber Beam and Support Structure
<SOLNBR>SB1341-05-Q-1043
<RESPDATE>091205
<ARCHDATE>09272005
<CONTACT>Carol  Wood, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-8884, Email carol.wood@nist.gov
<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted with respect to the Carbon Fiber Beam.  The Carbon Fiber Beam is a beam made of carbon fiber that has the dimensions described in the body of the solicitation.

The due date for quotations remains unchanged.


QUESTION 1:  Line Item 0001 - Carbon Fiber Beam 
Paragraph 1(d) - Mounting holes along neutral axis and positioned at airy points. - Please define what is meant by airy points.

RESPONSE:  The Airy points are points that you support a gage block or other length artifact when you are measuring them.  These points are unique in that a beam supported at these points will have minimum elongation in the measurement direction.  This is a standard metrology term.  The specific points are determined by the loading and the length of the beam.  The vendor should look up the term and calculate the appropriate position of the support points given the length of their proposed beam.


QUESTION:  Paragraph 1(e) - Sealed ends - Please define what is meant by "sealed"?

RESPONSE:  Carbon fiber has very poor hygroscopic properties.  That is when the relative humidity in the surrounding environment changes the length, shape and size of objects made from this material changes as well.  Metrology system manufacturers who make artifacts and machine components from these materials have developed a process referred to as "sealing" which eliminates the ability of the material to absorb water at the ends of the fibers.  That is to say, they coat the end of the fiber so that they cannot absorb water and do not distort as a function of the change in relative humidity. 


QUESTION:  Paragraph 2 - What discreet inclinations are preferred?

RESPONSE:  Discreet means that they may have a push pin or other mechanical locking mechanism which will allow the bar to be inclined at certain positions, say for instance 0, 22.5, 45, 67.5 and 90 degrees (angle the long axis of the beam makes with the ground). Other systems may simply clamp the beam along its side so that the beam can be positioned in any arbitrary incline angle.  Both options are acceptable as long as the beam can be supported at 0, 45 and 90 degrees.


QUESTION:  What is the intended operating environment for the beam?
	
RESPONSE:  20-90 percent relative humidity
           740-780 mmHG
           15-25 degrees Celsius


QUESTION:  Would the government ever desire to transport beam to other locations? 

RESPONSE:  Yes


QUESTION:  What would be the method of transport? 

RESPONSE:  Ship in transport case.


QUESTION:  Does the government require reusable shipping containers for the Carbon Fiber beam and support tripods? 

RESPONSE:  No
