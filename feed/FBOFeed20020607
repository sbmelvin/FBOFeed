<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. This announcement revises the previous announcement posted November 14, 2001. The following document describes the Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the Modernization of the Richard B. Russell Federal Building and Courthouse located in Atlanta, Georgia. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. A Fixed-Price Incentive (Successive Targets) contract under FAR 16.403-2 is contemplated. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade-offs).  Project Summary. The proposed modernization will be performed at the existing Federal building, which is a 24 floor, steel frame structure with approximately 1,281,446 gross square feet.   The project includes, but is not limited to, the complete removal of asbestos containing pipe insulation and floor tiles; HVAC system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; interior remodeling to include new partitions, carpeting, floor tiles, lay in-ceilings, waterproofing, doors and hardware.  Estimated combined (pre-construction and optional construction phase) project cost range is $25,000,000 to $30,000,000. Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. A Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants. Services to be Provided. The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel as needed to perform all required services including, but not limited to, those described in this pre-solicitation notice.  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, cost estimates, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest. Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental services. The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility. Proposal Submission Requirements.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to deNovis, Inc. of Lexington, Massachusetts.  deNovis will furnish technology in support of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Technology Platform (ATP) pilot project.  A Sources Sought Notice was published on the FedBizOps website on April 5, 2002. CMS received forty-one responses to the Sources Sought Notice.  deNovis, Inc. will provide an off-the-shelf solution containing the degree of completeness, availability and generic usability that is required to support the ATP pilot as specified in the synopsis portion of the Sources Sought Notice.  
 
The ATP pilot will use an off-the-shelf product that contains an all-inclusive, all-encompassing industry specific object model for the modern U.S. healthcare industry.  The off-the-shelf product will also contain an English-like high-level language suitable for use by Medicare program policy and business analysts.  The English-like language will map 1-to-1 to the object model and can be used to instantiate specific components of the object model.  An interpretive engine will translate the objects and language into directly executable logic maps.  The object model defines all the potential semantics (nouns and verbs) to enable an activity while the language defines a specific instance of an activity. 

The major objective of the ATP pilot is to radically change the Systems Development Methodology (SDM) for the creation of CMS health care administrative systems in general and CMS claims processing systems specifically.  CMS will build the ATP pilot to replicate the functionality of the Municipal Health Services Program demonstration system, using a set of tools that will allow the creation of claims processing systems through the use of breakthrough technology.  This technology will be sufficiently advanced to allow for the direct participation of Medicare program policy and business analysts, with no IT related training other than the ability to write English in a structured format, in the unambiguous creation of executable logic maps. The object model will provide traditional systems analysis and design functionality.  Generation of code will be done directly from policy and operational statements as they are restructured into the English-like language.  The anticipated advantage to CMS is the automation of resource intensive portions of the SDM, the rapid deployment of time sensitive changes, and the unambiguous mapping of policy and operational statements to executable logic maps.

This contract will be awarded for a period of performance of eight (8) months from date of contract award for the ATP pilot.

<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Education and Training Command, anticipates the release  of the Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas on or about 26 June 2002.

Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process, with an optional 3rd step.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Little Rock AFB project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Little Rock project.  In the second (optional) step of the RFP process, Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, may invite the pre-qualified offerors to participate in a one-day interview and concept refinement presentation.  In the 3rd step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.

The Little Rock Project involves the complete renovation of 1,201 units and upgrade of 334 previously renovated units.  The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,535 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Successful Offeror shall also assume the existing financial obligation of the Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs).  The Air Force expects to contribute leased real property and improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Little Rock family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<DESC>The United States Customs Service (USCS) may employ more than 300 fixed wing (F/W) and rotor-wing (R/W) pilots.   These pilots are Federally Warranted Law Enforcement Officers.  Since the events of September 11, 2001, the USCS has been tasked with additional organizational missions outside of its traditional Law Enforcement and Drug Interdiction mission. They are also being tasked with missions from the Office of Homeland Security.   USCS pilots may operate up to two of the following F/W aircraft: Cessna Citation II (C-550); Piper Cheyenne II (PA-42); the military C-12C; Beechcraft Kingair (BE-20); and the Cessna Centurion (C-210).  

The US Customs C-550 and PA-42 aircraft were specifically modified to accommodate the installation of military forward looking infrared optics and modified air-to-air fire control radar.  Some of the C-12C aircraft have also been modified with infrared optics and marine surface search radar.   Consequently, the C-550, PA-42, and some of the C-12C systems and performance characteristics are different than their civilian or military equivalents. It is not the purpose of this contract to teach the use or operation of the sensors - only the aircraft systems and other considerations that need to be conveyed to the cockpit crew in their operation of the aircraft and aircraft systems that have been modified to accept and operate these sensor systems.  Such as electrical power, center of gravity, air conditioning, etc..   

The potential contract will be a Performance Based contract with a Statement Of Objectives (SOO).  The purpose of this statement of objectives is to obtain a single business/contractor partner to support the US Customs Service Initial (first time) and Recurrent (annual) F/W pilot training needs.  Under this effort, the contractor shall be responsible for: 

1. Scheduling and conducting pilot training in accordance with the appropriate Federal Aviation Regulations (e.g. FAR Parts 61.55, 61.56, 61.57(c) and (d), 61.58, 142.);
2. Developing all course materials including those for the unique systems in C-550, PA-42, and C-12C (marine search) aircraft; the differences are briefly outlined in Appendix 1.
3. Becoming highly informed if not experts on the unique C-550, PA-42 and C-12C (marine search) systems and performance parameters;
4. Providing training/refresher material in other areas not normally associated with Part 61 or 142 requirements;
5. Producing and delivering program reports, accounting reports, and training certificates;
6. Maintaining all required FAA certificates needed to conduct the training and awarding of those training certificates;
7. Meeting USCS training timeline requirements;
8. Meeting the challenge of the frequently changing USCS training schedules and requirements;
9. Providing a reasonable level of security and sensitivity to USCS information and data such as pilot schedules, records, aircraft characteristics and capabilities.

The anticipated contract type will be a Time & Materials contract.   Interested firms are encouraged to respond via email  to the Contracting Officer, William M. Stevens, at william.m.stevens@customs.treas.gov or via phone at (202) 927-5703.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for administrative support services in support of the Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments (AGATE) Alliance Closeout.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the  administrative support services from Strategic Alliance Resources Network (STARNet), who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. STARNet has developed an unparalleled knowledge base of the AGATE Alliance and possess unique qualification that include: sole advisors of the AGATE Alliance to NASA and private sector members on the design of the AGATE Alliance and membership issues; designer and implementor of the AGATE audit policy and methods; and gathered, summarized, and reported AGATE commercialization results.  Such qualifications  would take substantial time and money for another company to duplicate and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  Among the primary services STARNET will provide include: gather, organize and prepare information and reports to document Alliance's contract performance; research, develop and recommend resolution of membership status and disputes, issue report documenting recommended membership dispute closeout, update the AGATE commercialization impact report, determine whether quantitative methods can be used as the basis on which verification of in-kind matching can be verified.  STARNET will use its unique capabilities and qualifications to accomplish these services. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 14, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following describes the proposed Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Contract for the renovation of the Richard B. Russell Federal Building & Courthouse located in Atlanta GA. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services.  A Fixed-Price Incentive (Successive Targets) contract under FAR 16.403-2 is contemplated.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. (FAR 15.101-1 trade-offs).  Project Summary.  The proposed modernization will be performed at the existing Federal Building, which is a 24 floor, steel frame structure with approximately 1,281,446 gross square feet. The project includes, but is not limited to, the complete removal of asbestos containing pipe insulation and floor tiles; HVAC system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; interior remodeling to include new partitions, carpeting, floor tiles, lay in-ceilings, waterproofing, doors and hardware. Estimated combined (pre-construction and optional construction phase) project cost range is $25,000,000 to $30,000,000. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis and is opened to participation by both large and small business concerns. The applicable Standard Industrialized Classification Code for this procurement is 1542 with a size standard of $17 million.  Funds are not currently available for this project.  The government anticipates that funding will be made available for the Pre-Construction Services around March 2002, and for Construction Services in fiscal year 2003.  Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. The Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer, GSA?s selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.  Proposal Submission Requirements. Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202).  Under Stage I, offers must submit information regarding the firm?s qualifications including past performance, past experience, resources, and key personnel experience.  Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government will evaluate Stage I submissions to identify and advise the offers about their potential to be viable competitors. The Government shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the Stage I RFP; advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.

Under Stage II, offers must submit additional information identified in the Stage II RFP. The Stage II evaluation will be based on technical factors as well as price. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  Oral presentations and a brief interview will be required as part of the Stage II technical evaluation process. Oral presentations by offerors may substitute for, or augment, written information. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The following evaluation factors will be evaluated and scored.  Stage 1: 1) Firm?s Past Performance in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-Construction Services on Similar Projects (455 points); 2) Firm?s Past Experience in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-Construction Services on Similar Projects (245 points);  3) Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel (200 points); and 4) Firm?s Resources, Facilities and Technology (100 points).   Stage 2: 1) Project Management Plan (200 points).

<DESC>I. Background
The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service ("US&FCS" or "Commercial Service") is the worldwide client service delivery arm of the International Trade Administration (ITA), operating over 100 Export Assistance Centers (EACs) domestically, and approximately 175 Commercial Posts in 78 countries overseas. The US&FCS is chartered to provide export promotion and facilitation services, products and programs to small-to-medium-sized U.S. business enterprises (SMEs) globally. Commercial Officers and Specialists in our overseas posts, and Trade Specialists in our EACs in the United States, counsel such firms; offer strategic export planning expertise; assist with trade mission and event participation; and develop and deliver client-requested market intelligence and trade data. US&FCS also retails a wide range of market research, trade contact, matchmaking (i.e., U.S. seller with foreign buyer) and business facilitation products and services.
Through a Public/Private collaboration with IBM Corporation, the US&FCS has also recently developed and launched BuyUSA.com, a dynamic new Government-to-Business (G2B) website intended to assist US SMEs in the location of qualified international buyers and trading partners. The site also offers international and domestic market research; ability for users to create a product/service brochure or catalog; interactive connection to promising trading partners; and a variety of educational information and guidance on conduct of international business. BuyUSA membership is offered to US businesses under the USG Cost Recovery Mandate: a basic annual  subscription is available for $400, and some additional add-ons are optional. There is also a free registration which provides access to a limited set of site offerings, and qualified international companies considered potential US trading partners register for free. Revenue is shared between the US&FCS and IBM, and that revenue-sharing may be extended to other firms selected to offer services and/or products via BuyUSA.com.
The BuyUSA service and program is specifically structured  to integrate US&FCS and other internet-based service delivery with the unique global physical network of the US&FCS, offering BuyUSA.com users direct access to and assistance from experienced Trade Specialists and Commercial Officers with expertise in all industry sectors/subsectors, and in all major country and regional markets worldwide. The BuyUSA.com website is fully US Government owned, and is located at http://www.buyusa.com
II. Purpose. This RFQ is issued to obtain technical and business responses from firms interested in working cooperatively with the US&FCS to structure and implement public-private partnerships resulting in value added, internet based export promotion/facilitation tools for benefit of small to medium sized U.S. exporters. The US&FCS specifically does NOT seek to fund development of such tools, but rather to assure that they, and underlying technologies, are used effectively and efficiently to aid U.S. exporters. Thus, partnerships on services or capabilities are to be proposed at NO COST to the US&FCS. Firms responding to this RFQ are required to make proposals for partnerships between the US&FCS and the respondent that, as a first choice, generate revenues to be shared with the US&FCS (in return for US&FCS contact information or other support). As a second choice, firms may make offers that generate revenues only for the firm, but must also add value to US&FCS offerings to US exporters. (See item # 5 below). Specific results sought through these partnerships include:
1. Electronic delivery, posting and maintenance on BuyUSA.com of timely and relevant international business information of value to US exporters, or to overseas firms and entities seeking to source US goods and services via the website.
2. Delivery, maintenance and management of online capabilities and tools to be accessed and utilized by to conduct or facilitate conduct of exporting by US firms.
3. Enabling, through web links, site integration, creation of gateway pages or other means of access by BuyUSA users to other web portals or sites which facilitate international sales, agreements, transactions and the like.
4.Extension of web-based partnership offerings to other means and media for assisting US exporters and trading partners including service delivery through, or in cooperation with, the above-described US&FCS worldwide network of offices.
5. Provision to both the US&FCS and BuyUSA subscribers of financial services including payment processing, revenue handling and related "back-end" fiscal services which facilitate and support customer payment of BuyUSA subscription and service fees by both online credit card entry and check submission.
6. Generation, through fees for subscriptions, web-based services, transactions, and web retailing of goods and service, of revenues to be shared with US&FCS sufficient for it to recover its costs associated with providing such services.
7. Enhanced marketing and sales of BuyUSA subscriptions.
III. Scope
This solicitation seeks public-private partnership proposals as described above from U.S. firms that are:
"	Currently engaged in the facilitation of buying, selling, or promoting U.S. goods and service; and/or 
"	Currently engaged in promotion and/or facilitation of exporting of goods and services from the United States; and/or 
"	Currently engaged in Internet based business activities which can clearly enhance one or both of the above and are pursuing such activities wholly or in part via a dedicated Internet business model or presence.
Number/Length of Partnerships: The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this RFQ. The period of performance for each resulting award will be not less than one (1) year to three (3) year period of service with the option to renew by agreement of both parties.
Partnership Activation Schedule. Because this solicitation envisions multiple awards and partnerships of differing natures, selected partners may be incorporated within the BuyUSA program and activated on the BuyUSA.com site at anytime following selection, as a function of such considerations as value of partner offerings to BuyUSA subscribers, ease and cost of integration, compatibility of partner offerings with pre-existing BuyUSA capabilities and brand, and others. Detailed plans and timelines will be agreed upon mutually between the US&FCS, IBM, and each selected partner. 
Examples of the type of products, services and offerings envisioned to provide results identified above include:
-databases of value to US exporters such as those containing overseas buyers, market intelligence, potential agents/distributors for US products and services, trade finance sources, overseas Government tenders, export or import service providers, etc.
-export logistics, compliance, risk avoidance and similar solutions and tools.
-transactional capabilities covering one or more of the points along the continuum from initiation of an international business transaction through order fulfillment and settlement.
-support to or conduct of export payment processing and financial settlement.
-work process tolls and applications which facilitate and/or simplify one or more of the processes to be executed by a US exporter or foreign trading partner of US firms.
-ancillary capabilities such as language translation, currency conversion, and others which while not created specifically to enhance US exports, may clearly be applied with value toward that objective.
IV. Business Considerations Related to this Solicitation.
In order to assist firms considering or preparing a response to the RFQ, the following areas will be of interest to US&FCS in the formation and operation of any business relationship (s) resulting, and will be addressed in any subsequent implementation of partnerships.
1.Project and Partnership Budgeting ? Prior to initiation of work resulting from the RFQ, the US&FCS and partner project teams will develop and issue a comprehensive Project Budget, Methodology, and Plan detailing the responsibilities, processes and timetables governing Project funding. This will clarify and document any all expenses to be incurred by the US&FCS, IBM, and the selected partner.
2.Cost Recovery US&FCS is required to charge sufficient costs for its services to recover its costs of developing and implementing said services. With respect to BuyUSA.com and web-based partnerships in connection therewith, the US&FCS Project Budget component will include an estimate of all appropriate costs (e.g., personnel, marketing, development, etc.) in accordance with its cost recovery mandate. Where such partnerships result in revenue
generation for BuyUSA, the US&FCS will only derive that amount of revenue sufficient to cover those cost recovery items in the budget; remaining revenues will be directed to the contracted
partner, to IBM Corporation for costs incurred in providing integration and other technical solutions, or to reinvestment in the website itself. Apportionment of shares will be agreed upon
between the US&FCS and contracted partners prior to incorporating partner offerings into the BuyUSA program.
3. Audit/Review - All project and partnership financial systems, operations and procedures must comply with applicable Federal and DoC standards, and be subject to Commerce and General Accounting Office audit. US&FCS will review quarterly the project's operations and revenues. Any modifications of project financing and budget plans, or change in use of revenues will be recommended based on this review, and discussed  and agreed upon with the
contracted partner.
4. Pricing The US&FCS is statutorily mandated to focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given the price sensitivity of SMEs, proposed prices for the project's services for SMEs must be agreed upon by US&FCS and the Project Partner to ensure that the prices are reasonable for such a client base while meeting the needs of both US&FCS and contracted partners.
5. Initial Funding for Designations Because revenues may not be generated initially at a level which will support early cost recovery, parties must budget for start-up, internal and external 
marketing, staff training, etc. without dependence on project-based revenue. During first-year quarterly reviews, US&FCS and Project Partner will determine the extent to which such front-
end costs may be reimbursed from project revenues. 
6. Data and Related Rights.  All rights in data, trade and service marks, materials, logos licensing and other instances/dimensions of Intellectual Property Rights arising from contracted partner offerings, will be expressly agreed upon between the US&FCS and such partners prior to incorporation of these offerings into the BuyUSA program and website.
7. Liabilities  US&FCS requires that the contracted partner maintain insurance in the event of any disputes arising from use of the "Marketplace" by customers. 
V. Evaluation Criteria. 
Proposals submitted will be evaluated using these technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in rank order of importance.
1.	Past Performance and demonstrated success in the conception, development, implementation, operation and support of large scale, web-resident searchable databases, web-hosted business process/transaction capabilities or other web tools clearly able to enhance and/or facilitate exporting activities of small-medium sized U.S. firms.

5.	Expressed willingness to offer online services through BuyUSA.com in a manner fully compliant with security, accessibility, policy and other governance applicable to a US Government website.
6.

For the Dream Anatomie Exhibit in the NLM rotunda to begin in September 2002, NLM has a request to have Anatomical Travelogue created a full color moving hologram.  The hologram will show a human, Atlas, holding the globe while standing up.  Depending on the direction of the spectator's motion (from left to right or from right to left) Atlas will shift the globe from one shoulder to the other.  This moving, full color Atlas Hologram will be an integral component of the Dream Anatomie Exhibit at NLM.  This moving, full color Atlas Hologram is a part of the Visible Human Project in which Anatomical Travelogue helped develop and create art work and animation work based on the project.

<SOLNBR>DAAH10-02-C-0059
<RESPDATE>072502
<ARCHDATE>08242002
<CONTACT>Tremayne Terry, (757) 878-4825
<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of a Research and Development (R&D) program entitled, “Improved Loads Determination.”  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the g uidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding this requirement. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION  OF PROGRAM: Data manipulation and analysis technologies have revolutionized how data is used to enhance design of aircraft.  The use of these technologies to evaluate trends and forecast future events shapes and refines the outcome of the product.  The ae rospace community has looked at data manipulation for its value as an analysis tool on helicopter usage and maintenance.  Data manipulation is also a tool that can be applied to the design process of the aircraft. Though many aerodynamic trends are intuiti ve to design engineers, there are other trends not yet realized.  By taking existing data on aircraft design and performance engineers can look for these useful trends with data manipulation and analysis and integrate them into the design process.       For decades the Army has flight tested its aircraft for numerous purposes.  During flight tests volumes of data are gathered and stored to verify the aircraft is performing as expected. Through the use of data manipulation and analysis, this data is not on ly useful in verification of expected performance but also in designing future upgrades and new aircraft.  AATD desires research and development of data manipulation and analysis technologies such as data mining, knowledge discovery, rule-based forecasting , artificial intelligence and/or evolutionary computation for use in the design phases of rotorcraft.  These tools are to be used to obtain high fidelity results in loads prediction for use in the design phase.  Technologies should include the ability to a nalyze existing data of various types and produce trends and suggestions to be utilized in the design phase of Army manned and unmanned air vehicles.  The technologies should also be useful in “real-time” such that data gathered on current models can be ef ficiently analyzed and applied to block upgrades and new model designs during the design phase.  The product should be highly accurate and reliable such that future flight test costs could be offset by the use of this tool in the design phase.  The proposa l must address the validation of the solution to rotorcraft technology.  GFD, if available, may be provided to successful offerors.  Offerors should indicate what type of GFD is required and indicate an alternate source of validation data should GFD not be  available.  The solution should be useable on a variety of types of data such that it can be tailored and applied to design of future projects.  The output should show not only the trends but also the factors involved in those trends.  Since this is to be  a design tool it should be easy to search whole or partial lists of data. The user interface should have a selection of forecasting new trends as well as selecting an outcome performance measure and obtaining a list of the factors that determine it and th eir importance.  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Planned funding for all acquisitions to satisfy this topic is about $800k total over two (Government) fiscal years, beginning in FY02.  Proposals must follow the guidelines described in thi s solicitation.  Also, any Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) requirements must be detailed.  DELIVERABLES:  All contracts awarded under this solicitation will require delivery of the following data items:  (1) Management Plan, (2) Test Plan (if applicab le), (3) Bi-Monthly Cost and Performance Reports, and (4) Final Report.  FINAL BRIEFING:  All contracts awarded under this solicitation will include a requiremen t for the Contractor to present the results of their work in a final briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all technical work under the contract.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The selection of one or more sources for contract award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals  submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in narrative ratings which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals submitted under each topic.  Proposed cost will be evaluated, as appropriate, for realism and reas onableness.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional consulting services on a sole source basis with Garrison/Lull Inc.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Garrison/Lull is the only known source capable of providing the consulting services.  In the field of consulting services for libraries, archives, and museums on creating or improving conservation environments for their collections, Garrison/Lull Inc is  recognized as the most qualified and experienced company in the country.  Since 1981, the company has provided environmental consulting services for more than one hundred libraries, archives, museums, and historical societies.  Clients have included major research libraries such as Harvard, the Library of Congress, Cornell, the New York Public Library, and Stanford.  Services provided to these institutions are similar to those required by the National Library of Medicine.

Mr. William Lull is widely recognized in the library, archives, and museums fields as the person most highly qualified to provide conservation environment consultation services. He has worked as a designer and project manager for architects, engineers, and government agencies.  He is the co-author of two important books, Conservation Environment Guidelines for Libraries and Archives and Air Quality Criteria for Storage of Paper-Based Archival Records, and has presented many lectures and workshops on the topic of creating conservation environments. He has a BSAD/Building Technology degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Building Technology at New York University. Consulting in the area of library and archives conservation environments is a very small field. We are not aware of other companies with Garrison/Lull's level of expertise and experience

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market technology developed by NREL?s National Wind Technology Center (NWTC).  The technology is a low Reynolds number airfoil(s) for small fan applications less than two (2) meters in diameter, which reduces power consumption.  The low Reynolds number airfoil (s) hereinafter will be referred to as ?technology?.  Applications for this technology could include: automotive (light truck, SUV), diesel locomotives, HVAC, air handling applications, and transformer cooling.   The Department of Energy?s (DOE) new efficiency standard for central air and heat pump, 12 SEER minimum (20% efficiency gain over current standards) is to go into effect in 2006.  This technology could be employed to help meet the new DOE central air and heat pump efficiency standards.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  This technology is the subject of an invention disclosure and will require a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be put in place prior to reviewing the invention disclosure.  
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must respond with a Letter of Interest describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Please provide your written Letter of Interest by August 10th, 2002 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  For additional information regarding NREL and technology transfer, please visit the NREL Technology Transfer website at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/.
Should your response be judged to offer a viable licensing opportunity for this technology, a business or product commercialization plan may be required prior to negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

Please send Letters of Interest to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or Email Richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market technology developed by NREL?s National Wind Technology Center (NWTC).  The technology is a low Reynolds number airfoil(s) for small fan applications less than two (2) meters in diameter, which reduces power consumption.  The low Reynolds number airfoil (s) hereinafter will be referred to as ?technology?.  Applications for this technology could include: automotive (light truck, SUV), diesel locomotives, HVAC, air handling applications, and transformer cooling.   The Department of Energy?s (DOE) new efficiency standard for central air and heat pump, 12 SEER minimum (20% efficiency gain over current standards) is to go into effect in 2006.  This technology could be employed to help meet the new DOE central air and heat pump efficiency standards.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  This technology is the subject of an invention disclosure and will require a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be put in place prior to reviewing the invention disclosure.  
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must respond with a Letter of Interest describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Please provide your written Letter of Interest by August 10th, 2002 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  For additional information regarding NREL and technology transfer, please visit the NREL Technology Transfer website at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/.
Should your response be judged to offer a viable licensing opportunity for this technology, a business or product commercialization plan may be required prior to negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

Please send Letters of Interest to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or Email Richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional indexing services on a sole source basis from The British Library, United Kingdom, for a continuation of existing services for the on-line indexing services using NLM's web-based indexing system.  The Index Section of the National Library of Medicine is responsible for the indexing of life science journals for Index Medicus and MEDLINE.  Since the 1980s indexing has been obtained for certain journals published in Great Britain from the international MEDLARS partner, the British Library at Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire, UK.  The indexing policies and procedures used at NLM are given in the NLM Indexing Manual, supplemented by technical memoranda and other indexing aids.  The major effort required by indexing is the analysis of journal articles for subject matter and the application of appropriate subject headings, drawn from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), NLM's controlled vocabulary.  Indexers will use NLM's web-based online indexing system to add subject headings to the online record for each article.  Indexers will access the online record for each article and review the descriptive data that has been provided for each one (pagination, language, authors, author affiliation and title).  The online indexing system contains many validation programs to detect real or potential errors. Indexers will respond to "Error" or "Warning" messages generated by the system.  NLM will provide access to the NLM Indexing Manual, MeSH and standard NLM-generated indexing aids.  Some of these may be available in electronic format on the Web; when they are available in print format, NLM will provide sufficient quantities for each indexer.  NLM will supply URLs and necessary passwords to access Web-based journals.  The British Library will subscribe to an agreed-upon list of journals published in the United Kingdom.  NLM will provide access to the online indexing system, seven days a week and almost 24 hours per day.  Occasionally weekend availability will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance to the NLM computer system.  NLM will notify the indexing center as soon as journal issues have had descriptive information entered into the online indexing system.  Indexing services will be provided at the rate of approximately 1,625 articles per month, or 19,500 articles for twelve (12) months period.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of twelve (12) months with two (2) one-year option periods.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner, which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information and staffing criteria.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market technology developed by NREL?s National Wind Technology Center (NWTC).  The technology is a low Reynolds number airfoil(s) for small fan applications less than two (2) meters in diameter, which reduces power consumption.  The low Reynolds number airfoil (s) hereinafter will be referred to as ?technology?.  Applications for this technology could include: automotive (light truck, SUV), diesel locomotives, HVAC, air handling applications, and transformer cooling.   The Department of Energy?s (DOE) new efficiency standard for central air and heat pump, 12 SEER minimum (20% efficiency gain over current standards) is to go into effect in 2006.  This technology could be employed to help meet the new DOE central air and heat pump efficiency standards.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  This technology is the subject of an invention disclosure and will require a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be put in place prior to reviewing the invention disclosure.  
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must respond with a Letter of Interest describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Please provide your written Letter of Interest by August 10th, 2002 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  For additional information regarding NREL and technology transfer, please visit the NREL Technology Transfer website at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/.
Should your response be judged to offer a viable licensing opportunity for this technology, a business or product commercialization plan may be required prior to negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

Please send Letters of Interest to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or Email Richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the Advanced Direct Contact Condenser (ADCC), U.S. patents # 5,925,291 and # 6,282,497, hereinafter referred to as ?technology?.  The ADCC was developed to improve efficiency, reduce emission treatment costs, and remove non-condensable gases in geothermal power plants.  The ADCC is also applicable to fossil fueled steam/Rankine cycle baseload power plants with dry or wet cooling, commercial air conditioners, and other processes that incorporate a condenser.  When installed in a 110 MW geothermal plant at the Geysers in California, the NREL ADCC increased the plant efficiency by 5% allowing a 17% increase in throughput capacity and cut the emission abatement cost by 50%.  The increase in efficiency, output, and cost reductions resulted in an annual savings of approximately $1 Million and a payback period of less than five years.  Additional technical information is available on the NREL web site at: http://www.nrel.gov.geothermal/ADCC.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive (the ADCC has already been licensed exclusively for the geothermal application) or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research program, a CRADA program, or a Technical Service agreement.    
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must respond with a Letter of Interest describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and motivation for pursuing this opportunity [alternate: organizations interested in commercializing this technology should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology].  Please provide your written Letter of Interest by August 10th, 2002 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  For additional information regarding NREL and technology transfer, please visit the NREL Technology Transfer website at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/.
Should your response be judged to offer a viable licensing opportunity for this technology, a nondisclosure agreement may be required prior to further discussions.  A business or product commercialization plan may be required prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiation.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

Please send Letters of Interest to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or Email Richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<CONTACT>ANTHONY C. KENDRELL
<DESC>The Government is planning a Firm Fixed (FFP), acquisition, to qualify the production lot performance of an ELVAX™ coated M206 infrared flare. The moisture-resistant ELVAX™ coating formulation and processing technique are the result of a two-year R&D effort performed by the Pyro Systems group at TACOM, ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ.  This Statement of Work (SOW) proposes a production of approximately Four Hundred Fifty (450) Magnesium-Teflon-ELVAX™ (MTE) formulated M206 flares at an existing M206 infrared flare production contractor facility.  The MTE flares produced will be subjected to the standard M206 first article tests by the contractor. The remaining flares will be sent to ARDEC and OO-ALC/WMBA, Hill Air Force Base.  ARDEC will confirm static infrared output, velocity performance, and efficacy of ELVAX™ in reduction of  hydrogen outgassing. OO-ALC/WMBA will flight test the MTE flares to confirm performance equivalent to the standard M206.  The results of this SOW effort can be applied to similar magnesium based infrared flare formulations.  Upon successful completion of this program, a follow on effort will be initiated to incorporate the MTE formulation into the M206 Technical Data Package. A Limited Source negotiation is contemplated with Kilgore Flares Company LLC, and BAE SYSTEMS Integrated Defense Solutions, Inc, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 because they are the only contractors approved to produce the standard M206 Flare, and that currently possess the critical skills, facilities and equipment required to manufacture infrared countermeasure flares. The solicitation will be available for downloading from http://procnet.pica.army.mil approximately forty-five days from the publication of this notice.  See numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market technology developed by the National Bioenergy Center, Chemistry for Bioenergy Systems Division.  The technology utilizes near infrared (NIR) spectrophotometry to analyze surface properties and make predictions about the underlying substrate.  In 2000, the NIR technology won an R&D100 award. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  NREL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the NIR technology under a sponsored research or CRADA program.  Additional technical information is available by searching the following web site: http://www.nrel.gov.  By entering ?near infrared spectrophotometry? or ?NIR? into the search box, one can view publications on NIR.  This technology is the subject of invention disclosures and patents pending and will require a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be put in place prior to reviewing the invention disclosures or patents pending.  
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must respond with a Letter of Interest describing the organization?s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Please provide your written Letter of Interest by August 10th, 2002 to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  For additional information regarding NREL and technology transfer, please visit the NREL Technology Transfer website at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/.  
Should your response be judged to offer a viable licensing opportunity for this technology, a business or product commercialization plan may be required prior to negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

Please send Letters of Interest to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or Email Richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure wildlife management services via herding of Canada Geese.  Due to the continuing  increase in the number of Canada geese on the 570 acre property located at 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD,  NIST has a requirement for the services of  a trainer and registered, fully trained herding dog to restrict, minimize, and/or eliminate the presence of  the geese using standard herding practices.  No animals are to be harmed as a result of the dog's  activities.  The trainer and dog  must work effectively together to restrict  herding activities to only the geese.  Other wildlife on the site include deer, fox, groundhogs, raccoons, and a variety of  birds.  The contractor's objectives are to restrict the geese to the  areas immediately surrounding the ponds and wetland area to minimize goose/staff interaction around all buildings, walkways, and parking lots and to reduce the site-wide population to 100 Canada geese.  Herding services shall be conducted randomly on a weekly basis from several times per day to several times per week based on seasonal and migratory waterfowl practices, nesting periods, and/or nuisance activities.  The Contractor shall have sole ownership and responsibility for the dog(s) employed in this service.  Contractor must have an animal available to meet the requirements of this contract at all times (i.e., if primary animal is ill or injured, a backup must be available).  Contractor shall be responsible for  all shelter, care, transportation and veterinary services, and insurance.  As part of the evaluation process, offerors may be required to give an on-site demonstration of techniques to be utilized.  Evaluation will be based on the control of the animal by the handler and the responsiveness to command  in achieving the desired goal.  The Government anticipates a firm fixed price contract for a 12 month base year period with four one year option periods, if exercised.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  The solicitation, SB1341-02-R-0005, is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about November 1, 2001 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.  Potential offers are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders lists will be maintained.  Potential offerors are required to direct all questions via email to Diane.Loeb@nist.gov.

<CONTACT>Brian Anderson, 202-493-0115
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking next generation weather and radar processor (WARP) capabilities to gather, process and disseminate aviation weather data to the Meteorologists, Area Supervisors, Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) and other data users in the National Air Space (NAS) en route domain.  Please provide your responses based upon the details herein.   <P> WARP is a weather-processing sub-element of the National Airspace System Air Traffic Control element.  This current infrastructure is operational; however, with new technologies available, the FAA is seeking opportunities that provide a leading-edge approach to provide this capability.  Broadly stated, the WARP system is responsible for the following functions: <P> ·	WARP provides Weather Unit personnel with processing tools and a single, integrated workstation to receive and consolidate weather data from multiple sources into a single database for distribution within the NAS. <P> ·	WARP enables the meteorologists to analyze the data and generate specialized value-added aviation weather products that are displayed to support air traffic control operations. <P> ·	WARP gathers weather data from 149 Doppler weather radars and other sources. <P> ·	WARP provides weather-briefing terminals at the Traffic Management Unit (TMU) and area supervisors’ consoles. <P> ·	WARP makes Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) information available to the display for ATC Controllers. <P> WARP is the common source for weather information in the en route environment.  Further information about the current WARP program may be accessed via the following website: <P> http://www.faa.gov/aua/ipt_prod/weather/Warphp1.htm <P>  The FAA is seeking vendors with the expertise to accomplish this large and complex program.  The Federal Aviation Administration, National Weather Service and the Department of Defense all utilize this processing capability.

<DESC>This Request for Information is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or Request for Proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to either procure any services or pay for the information received.  In the Facilities Services Division of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a team has been assembled to establish a new on- or off-site Information and Referral Call Center.  The Call Center will direct callers to OPM employees and program offices, based on the type of information the callers are seeking.  The team is currently conducting market research to determine the appropriate staffing, services, hours, equipment and other elements appropriate to such a Call Center.  It recognizes the importance of industry involvement in such research and offers the following questions to interested parties to further the team's discussions: 1.  What services does your company provide?  2. What hours of service does your company provide? 3.  What equipment does your company provide your employees (e.g., phones, reference books, computerized index, etc.)?  4. What resources does your company devote to a given number of customers (for instance, one employee per hundred calls)?  5. What "best practices" does your company recommend?  6. Do your employees work in a central location or from their homes?  7. Do your employees provide any information other than that associated with your customers?  For instance, will your employees direct callers to another person or organization if the callers' questions do not apply to the agency or company for which they are working?  Please provide us with written responses that are detailed and specific.  We are also interested in knowing what is the capability of the small business community for performing work of this type. The North American Industry Classification System code for this project is 561421, and the definition of a small business is a firm that has had $6 million or less in average annual receipts over the company's prior three fiscal years.  All interested parties are encouraged to forward their responses to these questions via fax at 202-606-1508 or by e-mail to either Mr. Ronald Peacock at rapeacock@opm.gov or Mr. James S.
