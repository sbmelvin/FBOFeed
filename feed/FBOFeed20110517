<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the Sources Sought notice resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not appropriate.

The Government intends to reserve at least half of the prime awards for small businesses. The 2 - 3 small businesses determined to be of best value to the Government will receive prime awards depending on the total number of prime awards made. Any additional acceptable small business proposals will compete with large businesses for the remaining awards. In the event 2 - 3 acceptable small business proposals are not received, the Government reserves the right to select up to 6 prime awardees from all Offerors.</p>

<CONTACT>Courtney A. Piar, Phone 301-619-7467, Email courtney.piar@med.navy.mil
<DESC>Pre-solicitation - Pharmacy Automation
<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command has a requirement for firm fixed priced Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts in accordance with FAR 12 and FAR 16.5 for Pharmacy Automation in support of Navy Medicine Information. The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to release a solicitation N62645-11-R-0027 in early June 2011. This solicitation is intended to result in multiple firm fixed priced Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with a five year period (base year plus four one-year options). The requirement will be fulfilled via an unrestricted, full and open competitive acquisition. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The NAICS code for this requirement is&nbsp;&nbsp;423450 with a size standard of 500. All responsible sources may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Some Navy outpatient pharmacies currently contain automated Accumed counters that are approaching "end-of-life" and as of September 2012 will no longer be supported by the vendor. In addition to the equipment that will no longer be supported, there are various different flow approaches and equipment currently in use. This program is designed to replace the obsolete equipment and provide a more standardized process flow for many of the naval outpatient pharmacies.<br />Another major objective for the program is to improve the quality of dispensing. The pharmacies currently vary from manual operations directed by "paper" to some limited automation controlled by process flow software. It is the goal of this program to improve the overall quality by reducing the opportunities for errors. It has been shown that extremely high levels of quality can be attained by complete automation and system controlled manual dispensing. <br />A third objective of this program is to increase the volume capability of the various pharmacies. Currently consumer satisfaction is primarily measured by customer wait time. It is the goal of this program to increase the volume capability of the pharmacies within the currently allocated space while reducing the wait time to be less than thirty minutes for at least ninety percent of the customers during peak hours (thirty minutes including a ten minute maximum processing time). Since the customer has a choice to wait or to utilize alternative commercial retail pharmacies (through TRICARE), reducing the wait time per the goal stated, is anticipated and hoped to drive increased volume.<br />Other objectives of this program is to reduce operating costs related to improved inventory management (i.e. un-utilized, expired medications, medication quantity ordering), efficient staff utilization while maintain protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and increase security.<br />Currently many of the outpatient pharmacies also process refills. At some pharmacies, the refills are processed during the normal working day while at others; refills are accomplished off-shift. The process flow software of a proposed system shall enable refills to be filled either during the normal working day (but with a low priority so as to not impact customer wait time) or to be deferred to off-shift processing.</p>
<p>This solicitation is by electronic means only - no hard copies will be mailed to offerors. The official release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and all amendments will be posted on the Navy Electronic Business Opportunities (NECO) web site at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ which will upload to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>To receive consideration, Contractor must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration and have completed the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA). Telephone requests will not be accepted.</p>

<RESPDATE>060111
<CONTACT>Patrick W Gourley, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2898, Email pgourley@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) intends to compete and award a contract to develop a protocol and perform a pilot study in conjuction with the development of a biorepository for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) specimens.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this planned acquisition is to establish a protocol for the creation of a biorepository of specimens from persons with ALS enrolled in the National ALS Registry and to conduct a pilot effort based upon the protocol developed. Because the genetic causes of ALS are largely unknown, ATSDR is seeking expert guidance on establishing a biorepository of samples that are linked with ALS patients enrolled in the National ALS Registry. ATSDR is particularly interested in blood and tissue samples. While there are other biorepositories currently in existence that contain specimens from persons with ALS, these biorepositories are often limited and target select groups (e.g., military veterans with ALS). Submission of specimens for this biorepository would be open to all U.S. citizens and Legal Residents of the U.S with ALS enrolled in the congressionally mandated National ALS Registry. The ability to connect the biological material to information about risk factors and data about medical treatment will make the biorepository especially valuable to ALS researchers. Although biorepositories vary in scope and size, it is anticipated that the successful contractor will create a protocol that can be used to develop a biorepository of ALS human samples to complement the National ALS Registry. Before the protocol is developed, the Contractor should convene a group of experts in registries, surveillance, and/or neurological diseases to determine the best practices for establishing a biorepository as described. The Contractor will test and finalize the approved protocol by conducting a pilot effort to collect biological samples from at least 100 Registry enrollees.&nbsp; Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.&nbsp; Solicitation 2011-N-13395 will be posted in FedBizOpps on or about June 01, 2011 and the scheduled due date for proposals will be approximately 30 days after posting the solicitation.

<DESC>To support the U. S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Criminal Division - Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, DOJ's Justice Management Division, Procurement Services Staff, intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Gilardi &amp; Co., LLC (Gilardi), 3301 Kerner Boulevard, San Rafael, CA 94901, for claims administration services in support of United States v. Joseph P. Nacchio (D. Colo.), a criminal case arising from securities fraud committed against shareholders of Qwest Communications International, Inc. (Qwest). Gilardi will be responsible for distributing approximately $44 million in forfeited proceeds to victims of this offense over an estimated nine-month period beginning in June 2011. The Government's determination to negotiate this as a sole source contract is based on Gilardi's previous performance of claims administration in two related litigations involving the Qwest Securities: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Augustine M. Cruciotti, 1:04-cv-01267 (D. Colo.) and In re Qwest Communications International Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 01-cv-1451 (D. Colo.). In those cases, Gilardi handled three primary notification mailings to more than 1.9 million investors, managed the claims process, and distributed more than $645.6 million to fraud victims across four different distributions. Gilardi has developed a proprietary database of Qwest investors and their transaction histories which will allow an immediate notice mailing in the present case, ease the documentation burden on claimants, and reduce the likelihood of omissions, duplicate claims and/or defective claims. In addition, Gilardi has completed most, if not all, of the relevant research regarding mergers, corporate actions and other issues. Potential claimants are familiar with Gilardi as claims administrator, and Gilardi's call center staff has a thorough knowledge of the Qwest case, having worked extensively with class members resolving exceptions and answering questions. Gilardi can also provide claimants with an easy transition to this case by maintaining the same contact email address and toll-free number. By negotiating directly with Gilardi, the Government will avoid significant duplication of time and costs associated with identifying potential victims, setting up victim notification procedures and setting up forfeited proceeds distribution procedures.
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after the date this notice is published will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 333314 and the business size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics (LCBG), Molecular Pathology Unit conducts an integrated research program designed to elucidate the cellular and tissue changes associated with specific stages of carcinogenesis, to detect genetic modifiers fundamental to cancer susceptibility and progression, to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of major human cancers, and to develop rational approaches for cancer prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to acquire a device and software system necessary for the correct determination of pure biomarker spectra from mixed spectra taken from specimens. This determination of library spectra allows for signal unmixing of up to 8 different spectral generators, with a separation sensitivity of 1nm and is required for both quantitative analysis and sufficient generation of detectable signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The following salient characteristics apply to the CRi Nuance FX Multispectral Imaging System: <br /></span>&bull; Separating and quantitating up to 8 probe signals simultaneously (both fluorescent and non-fluorescent) within the same specimen.<br />&bull; Providing reproducible and sensitive detection of probe signal above noise, using narrow bandpass (less than 30nm), tunable liquid crystal filter, and apertures great than 20 mm to permit visual spectral unmixing.<br />&bull; Delineating auto-fluorescent signal, found particularly in FFPE specimens, from probe signal and removing from image and from downstream image analyses.<br />&bull; Tuning transmission wavelengths from 420nm - 720nm.<br />&bull; Discerning and separating probe transmission wavelengths within of 1nm sensitivity of one another. <br />&bull; Imaging system compatible with currently owned microscope, Zeiss Axioskope 2.<br />&bull; Quantitation software capable of analyzing images created by the multi-spectral unmixing of up to 8 separate probes within the same specimen (both fluorescent and non-fluorescent).<br />&bull; Quantitation image analysis software capable of automated machine-learning pattern recognition based tissue segmentation of both chromogenic and fluorescent labeled multi-spectral images.<br />&bull; Quantitation software able to train across ten or more individual images to develop pattern recognition algorithms.<br />&bull; Quantitation software providing rapid segmentation review and data merging.<br />&bull; Quantitation software capable of exporting spectrally unmixed signals on a per-cell basis from within selected tissue segmentation areas.<br />&bull; Automated pattern recognition-quantitation software compatible with acquisition software and files which permit seamless integration without conversion or 3rd party post processing.</p>
<p>Cambridge Research &amp; Instrumentation, Inc. (CRi) is the manufacturer and distributor of the Nuance FX System; they own patents on the instrumentation design and technology and are the only known source. CRi is the only known manufacturer of commercially available liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF)-based spectral imaging systems. The device and software are proprietary in nature and possesses unique features that are essential to the clinical and research operations of the Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics (LCBG), Molecular Pathology Unit.</p>

<DESC>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the mission of the Sickle Cell Vascular Disease Section of the NHLBI Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch is to develop new knowledge and treatments for sickle cell disease. A current focus of our program is pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell disease. This is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs that is associated with a ten-fold increase in risk of mortality in adults with sickle cell disease. We are gaining clinical experience with several different drugs for pulmonary hypertension and submitting a new clinical research protocol for two drugs that have not previously been used in sickle cell pulmonary hypertension. As part of this effort the Government is looking for consultative medical experience of the type that is detailed in the specifications. The consultant should be available to attend clinic weekly at the NIH Clinical Center, without additional reimbursement for travel. The consultant should also be available by telephone around the clock for 44 weeks per year.
<p>Adults with sickle cell disease and pulmonary hypertension have extremely complicated medical problems, and expert experience is required for their safe and competent medical management. It is a highly specialized field and there are a few physicians in the US with strong experience in this area. The Government requires a consultant with sophisticated expertise and experience in tertiary medical care of complex adult sickle cell disease patients with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension and related medical complications, such as chronic renal failure, priapism and cutaneous leg ulceration. These specifications are fulfilled by Dr. Oswaldo Castro. Therefore it is in the Government's best interest to award an order to Dr. Castro to provide the above as outlined in the specifications above.</p>

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the Fisheries Sampling Branch (FSB) for Northeast Fisheries Observer Program (NEFOP) training, Advanced Gear Training, At-Sea Monitoring Training Services. The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is required to collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data for fisheries by placing at-sea monitors aboard U.S. domestic fishing vessels in certain fisheries. These data cannot be obtained at the dock or on Government research vessels. These data are needed for the management and monitoring of Annual Catch Limits, in season quotas, and to assess patterns of by-catch. In the Northeast U.S., the Northeast Fisheries Observer Program (NEFOP) operates from Maine through North Carolina, and is overseen by the Fisheries Sampling Branch (FSB) at the NEFSC.
<p>The Contractor(s) shall provide services and equipment to support training trips aboard a commercial fishing vessel. The required training vessel five gear types are: bottom otter trawl, scallop dredge (Large and Small), gillnet, and long-line. The Fisheries Sampling Branch plans to conduct seven (7) trainings with several training trip opportunities within the NEFOP Observer Certification Course, the At-Sea Monitoring Certification Course, and Advanced Gear Certifications throughout each year. This is the best estimate, and is dependent on funding availability for observer coverage, commercial fishing effort trends, coverage requirements and mandates, and observer retention.</p>
<p>Training Courses:<br />1. Northeast Fisheries Observer Training<br />The Northeast Fisheries Observer Training is three weeks in length and includes three days of training trips, one day on either a trawl vessel, a gillnet vessel, and a scallop vessel. This course shall be offered three (3) times per year. <br />2. At-Sea Monitoring<br />The At-Sea Monitoring is a two-week course and includes one day on either a trawl vessel, a gillnet vessel, and a bottom long-line vessel. This course shall be offered two (2) times per year. <br />3. Advanced Gear Certification Course<br />Advanced Gear Certification Courses are offered for certain gear types that are not covered in the basic observer and at-sea monitoring training, and shall include, pair trawl, and bottom long-line. These are only offered to observers with an active observer certification in good standing and are generally two-days long. This course is estimated to be offered two (2) times per year but may be offered up to four (4) times per year. The class size is between 8 and 20 students, and the group is split into groups of less than six (6) to make for a small group size to go on the training trips. The students are accompanied by experienced observer trainers who work for FSB. The ratio of student to trainer is 3 to 1. The students experience, hands on, what it is like to apply their sampling and prioritization skills, as well as reinforce vessel safety and shipboard etiquette. During the fishing trips, students would collect the required suite of data on a pre-trip vessel safety checklist, collect gear characteristics, record haul or tow location information and weather variables. They will also estimate the amount of catch being brought onboard, using various catch estimation techniques, including actual weights, tally counts, basket sampling, and volume to volume. They will reference their program guides to determine sampling priorities. They will practice their species identification and biological sampling of the catch. They would also interview the captain on the trip costs, and offer the required program options, such as a Data Release Form and Fishermen's Comment Card.</p>
<p>This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 483112 Deep Sea Passenger Transportation. The small business size standard is 500 employees. NOAA anticipates the possibility of making multiple contract awards as a result of this solicitation and may award per contract line item number (CLIN). The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors, listed in descending order of importance 1 - 5, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Vessel Capability and configuration; (2) Vessel's commercial fishing history; (3) Captain and crew experience; (4) Vessel port availability (list home port, primary port, and all ports from Point Judith, RI through Scituate, MA that vessel is able to port); (5) Pertinent vessel documentation including a copy of the full-form marine insurance coverage on the vessel including Hull and Machinery and P&amp;I and a copy of either a structural survey or insurance carrier; (6) Past Performance and (7) Price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKET RESEARCH. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, OR INVITATION FOR BID. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. ALL RESPONSES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE ACQUISITION.
<p>2. MacDill AFB is seeking sources interested in a possible contract to provide an upgrade of the existing Motorola 10-Channel UHF trunking, land mobile radio (LMR) system. The system shall be designed to operate in UHF, 12.5 kHz-narrowband equipment that complies with National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) directives. The LMR System shall support P25 trunking standard features, 9600-baud control channel, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, and equipped to support Over-the-Air Rekeying (OTAR) and Over-the-Air Programming (OTAP). The system shall be software based and readily accept software enhancements for technology updates. The existing Motorola LMR system shall be used to the greatest extent possible. Services should include project management, systems engineering services, system design, system staging, equipment programming, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, training, and maintenance support for the system. The system will support all the features associated with APCO P25 trunking protocol with use of the 9600-bps control channel and AES encryption. The P25 wide area trunked 12.5 KHz digital narrowband radio system will utilize P25 digital narrowband 10-Channel trunked repeater site and IP based dispatch consoles. The system shall be capable of future expansion to include additional P25 digital narrowband trunked repeater sites and additional IP based consoles as needed. The proposed system capacity shall meet the minimum requirements listed below:</p>
<p>Number of Individual IDs 128,000<br />Number of Talk or Voice group IDs 16,000</p>
<p>The system shall provide RF coverage for base support users operating mobile and portable radio units. MacDill AFB understands reuse of the existing site will determine coverage and a coverage test will not be required.</p>
<p>It is the intent of MacDill AFB to continue use of existing Motorola portable radios and accessories. The current equipment to be upgraded is as follows: <br />Model Qty.<br />KVL-3000 Plus 11<br />XTL-5000 34<br />XTS5000 - I 426<br />XTS5000 - II 218<br />XTS5000 - III 20</p>
<p><br />As required, the radios will also offer audio interface capabilities to the existing external consoles or public address systems that are currently in use with some of the radios that are being replaced. In order to interoperate with these existing subscribers, the system's IV&amp;D solution must leverage the SNDCP protocol for any OTAR and OTAP applications.</p>
<p>MacDill AFB is located in a lightening prone area. The existing RF site may not sufficiently meet R-56 (a Motorola standard) nor the DoD equivalent standards for lightning protection. The Contractor shall upgrade, as needed, the existing site to meet Motorola R56 Standard rev2005, "Standards and Guidelines for Communications Sites" as it pertains to lightening protection.</p>
<p>3. All interested parties are invited to provide the following information about your company/institution, or any teaming or joint venture partners. Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability outlining past work relative to this requirement. The statement of capability shall include:</p>
<p>a) Contractor Name<br />&bull; Address<br />&bull; Point of Contact (POC)<br />&bull; POC phone number(s) and email addresses<br />&bull; CAGE Code</p>
<p>b) Description of Capability &amp; Approach<br />&bull; Approach/Methods of upgrading existing Motorola LMR system<br />&bull; System Description</p>
<p>c) Description of Relevant Contract Experience (Government and Commercial)<br />&bull; Contract number<br />&bull; Description of the requirement<br />&bull; Dollar Value<br />&bull; POC for the requiring activity<br />&bull; POC address, e-mail, phone number(s), fax number, and the company's web page, if applicable</p>
<p>4.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, in support of Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation for non-waterproof, hot weather mountain combat boots. The goal of this effort is to indentify firms with capabilities to provide/design/develop boots for use by the combat soldier in rugged mountainous terrains and conditions. Interest is in readily available product(s) or information on development that will be available within the next six to twelve months (must be based on a concise and attainable development/commercialization plan). The hot weather mountain combat boots must be capable of meeting critical technical and uniform requirements as follows: 1) durable, light hiking-style mountain boot that reduces shock impact while enhancing stability and support to the ankle. These boots, though stiffer and slightly heavier than traditional combat boots, are specially constructed to support movement and stabilize the foot and the ankle over more rugged terrain. 2) Provides for maximum breathability and water drainage during hot, wet conditions. 3) Outsoles that provide propulsion and torsional support while allow for breaking and stability while moving down and unstable decline. 4) Able to keep trail debris out of boot while maneuvering. 5) Designed to reduce pressure points and discomfort during descents on uneven, rugged terrain. 6) Prevents blistering during extended use. 7) Neutral color [such as olive, brown or coyote]. 8) Provide for quick break-in. 9) Stiff-soled with tread that grips rocky terrain and loose, however flexible enough to remain comfortable for long periods of activity. Interested sources must, within fourteen (14) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their current product(s) and how they are made or could be modified to address the U.S. Army requirement. Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and relevant company background/experience, and product sample if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample. Firms should provide pricing for currently available product and/or estimated pricing for footwear currently under development. Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business. This notice is for market research only.

<DESC>Notice Number: OPM32-11-T-0027
<p>Title: eSignature Integration in eQIP</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice (SS). <br /><br />This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business: HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small business: 8(a) small business; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industries Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for the project is 511210 - Software Publishers</p>
<p>The small business size standard is $25.0</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>OPM Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is issuing this Acquisition Plan to provide a solution for use within the Federal Investigative Services (FIS) EPIC (Electronic investigation forms, Personnel investigation processing, Imaging &amp; Clearance verification suite) for eQIP application to meet a Joint Reform Team approved initiative for the capture of digital signature with background investigation consent forms. The EPIC systems encompass online questionnaire entry; document imaging; case processing, tracking, and reporting; investigator reporting; interfacing to financial systems; fingerprint transactions; clearance verification; secure portal access; and a management reporting dashboard.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing (e-QIP) is implementing the capability to capture digital signatures on the certification and release pages produced for the Standard Forms contained within e-QIP. In response to the Intelligence and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004, the Joint Security and Suitability Reform Team (Joint Reform Team) developed a transformed process to provide further improvements to the suitability and security clearance process. The process was outlined in the Initial Report on Security and Suitability Process Reform, dated April 30, 2008, and provided a framework for an enterprise wide end-to-end process supported by appropriate IT systems to make hiring, credentialing, and clearance processes even more timely and efficient to meet IRTPA guidelines. The Joint Reform Team established the eApplication Working Groups to define requirements for the next generation of e-QIP in the 1st Quarter FY09. Through the working group it was identified that many customer agencies such as the US Army, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, and others as part of the EGov initiatives have developed and deployed the ability to capture digital signatures (signature). A future phase will integrate electronic (electronic ink) signatures utilizing a stylus pad to capture a visible signature from individuals completing forms for the agencies where this capability exists.</p>
<p>This acquisition will provide the capability to capture digital signatures within e-QIP and provide greater interoperability between FIS and customer agencies while reducing reliance on scanned paper copy.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>OPM is in the process of developing and implementing a solution that would allow the applicant to digitally sign (i.e., click to sign) the required signature pages.<br />&bull; Satisfies legal requirements of relevant e-signature acts<br />&bull; No additional software required by applicant; or if any software required, it must be available at no cost and deployable without administrative rights on the computer<br />&bull; Can be deployed within the OPM network and within the existing eQIP application with moderate integration <br />&bull; Requires no external access to the vendor's site<br />&bull; Usable with either Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox<br />&bull; Allows use of "Click-to-Sign"<br />&bull; Low impact on existing software architecture and back-end administration by OPM personnel</p>
<p>The vendor awarded a contract under this effort will be required to provide products and services in accordance with all applicable Government regulations and standards as set forth in the request for quotes.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541712, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of providing technical support to R&amp;D facilities conducting research in coordinate metrology.</p>
<p>The Engineering Metrology Group (EMG) and the Large-Scale Coordinate Metrology Group (LSCMG) of the Mechanical Metrology Division (MML) in the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) have long been involved in research in coordinate metrology. MML has developed several breakthrough technologies that have substantially transformed coordinate metrology throughout the world, such as the invention of the laser tracker and the first rigid-body error maps for coordinate measuring machines.</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Engineering Metrology Group (EMG) and the Large-Scale Coordinate Metrology Group (LSCMG) of the Mechanical Metrology Division (MML) in the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) have long been involved in research in coordinate metrology. MML has developed several breakthrough technologies that have substantially transformed coordinate metrology throughout the world, such as the invention of the laser tracker and the first rigid-body error maps for coordinate measuring machines. <br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) owns several high-accuracy coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) including two Moore M-48 CMMs using Leitz LTC CMM controllers. NIST seeks to modify these two CMMs, which require software modifications to the embedded controller. NIST has determined that ideally, both M-48 CMMs should run identical controller software and that in order to best leverage the large body of NIST experience with the M-48 CMM, the second M-48 CMM should be modified to match the hardware and software of the original M-48 machine. The EMG has acquired several one-of-a-kind CMM probes for specific types of measurements on NIST's highest accuracy CMM, the M-48. One of these probes was developed by the EMG as a special small-feature probe that involves the use of digital images; see references 1-9. A second probe was the prototype developed under a Small Business Innovative Research contract with InsituTec; see references 10-14. A third probe was constructed using lithography by Xpress Precision Engineering, see references 15-19. The EMG has developed a Probe Interface Controller (PIC) to integrate this diverse collection of probing systems into its M-48 CMM which nominally uses an analog Movomatic TriDim 3-D probe. The PIC is a 3-axis Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), which simplifies the interface between the M-48 and third party probes. NIST has demonstrated the concept using the Xpress Precision Engineering probe and urgently needs to extend the concept to the remaining probes.</p>
<p>I. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor shall modify and unify the LTC controller software for both M-48 CMM's. The CMM controller software is a large, commercial software system written in Object Pascal and hosted on an MS-DOS 6.22 based Industrial Process Controller. The CMM controller interfaces with other components using an IEEE-488 bus and interfaces with the measuring software using Ethernet and serial connections. The contractor shall modify the controller software to increase the resolution of the machine error map beyond the original map density. The contractor shall evaluate extension of the controller software to include control of a 2-axis goniometer. The contractor shall evaluate migration of the controller hardware and software to a virtual machine environment with a virtualized IEEE-488 device driver. <br /><br />The contractor shall interface CMM probes and instrumentation into coordinate metrology systems using the PIC system developed by NIST. The NIST PIC is a custom interface controller consisting of three Galil RIO-47122 PLC controllers and programmed using the GalilTools programming language. The contractor shall extend the NIST PIC to provide streaming data during probing for post processing and analysis. The contractor shall evaluate extension of the PIC to include probe tip form error mapping. The contractor shall evaluate extension of the PIC to include a locally dense, high-resolution error map for precision measurement over a specified small volume.</p>
<p>The contractor shall assist NIST personnel to upgrade three CMM measuring workstations to Leitz Quindos 7 software. The contractor shall upgrade the computer workstation with suitably rated hardware. The contractor shall be responsible for software installation and data migration.</p>

<DESC>Background:

The Navy regularly needs to dispose of aircraft, aircraft engines, and aviation components.  Disposal is problematic when dealing with Hazardous Materials (HazMat), Low Level Radiation Waste (LLRW) or composite fibers. 

Description and Contractor Responsibilities:  

Contractor shall operate in a secure environment and shall have a demonstrated knowledge of DoD regulations regarding demilitarization and disposal.  Contractor shall have current certifications and the demonstrated ability to conform with all applicable safety, health and environmental statutes and regulations. 

Contractor will be required to pick-up all material for disposal and provide all required labor, equipment, and technical services to include, but not limited to:

o	Shred and otherwise mutilate whole aircraft, aircraft engines, and aviation components.
 This includes complete destruction of materials ranging in size from micro-processors to jet aircraft;

o	Demilitarization in accordance with DoD 4160.21-M-1 or particular instructions provided by the government.  Demilitarization is the act of destroying all military or dangerous properties inherently associated with equipment and rendering it incapable of its originally intended military purpose;	

o	Material sortation: identification, removal, segregation, and return of recyclable material to government for resale and/or disposition at the governmentâs discretion.  Alternately, recyclable material may be retained by contractor for Fair Market Value based on indices and markets determined at the task order level

o	Disposal of above materials, and if necessary disposal of LLRW.
 All disposal will be handled in accordance with standards set by the Navyâs radiological Affairs Support office (RASO) and DoD Manual 4715.6-R, and with all federal, state, and local environmental regulations.	

o	Contractor will maintain records of all HazMat and recyclables processed. Results shall be included in monthly status reports including quantities of material disposed.

The majority of the material that the contractor will be required to pick-up for disposal will be located  at the Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson AZ.  However, the contractor may be required to pick-up materials elsewhere within CONUS, including remote areas that may be difficult to access. 

The Government anticipates to award a no-cost type contract.
 All proceeds from the sale of recyclable scrap will be retained by the contractor.  Request information from Industry regarding the practice of the sale of scrap materials. 

All responding sources shall provide a summary of their companyâs capabilities including organization name, address, description of facilities, personnel, and past experience; and a point of contact, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, business size, DUNs number, and CAGE Code.  In addition, all responding sources are to provide information regarding the industry practice of sale of recyclable scrap materials.  All submissions must be received by close of business 2 June 2011.  Responses to the Sources Sought are required in writing to Ms.
 Toni Cristinzio, 270.2D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111, or email address toni.cristinzio@navy.mil.

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 3:00PM on May 27, 2011.<br><br>Summary Scope of Work-<br>Channel stabilizing sills currently exist with the federal reach of Mill Creek from the Diversion Dam to 5 sills downstream from the Division Structure.  To satisfy fish passage requirements, the sills require modification.  Therefore, this requirement is for a prototype modification of 4 sills near the middle of the reach from Diversion to Division (identified as sills 93 - 96).  These sills shall be modified by cutting approximately 21 feet out of the existing 110 foot sill at approximately the center of channel and the left bank.  A two drop fishway shall be installed at sills 94 through 96 (total of 3) and a single drop notch shall be installed at sill 93.  <br><br>To perform these modifications, approximately 2/3 of the width of the channel shall be dewatered from sill 97 to sill 92 (approximately 316 feet).  An upstream cofferdam shall be installed and it is likely a pipe will be required to transport water around the work area.  A sump pump will also be required to dewater the pools and any inflowing groundwater and fish recovery shall be necessary during dewatering.    <br><br>The fishway shall be a reinforced concrete structure with two weirs with internal dimensions of 20 feet x 11 feet x 5 feet with 6 to 8 inch walls and floor-thereby extending approximately 6 feet upstream of the existing 6 foot long sills (in stream wise direction).  The notch shall be a reinforced concrete structure with internal dimensions of 20 feet x 6 feet x 1.5 feet with 6 to 8 inch walls and floor with a single weir and a floor that extends the full stream wise length of the sill.  Both structures shall be a graded, compacted bed using outside material to provide precise elevation control for the structures.  For scour protection, both structures require approximately a 3 to 5 foot concrete wall extending vertically down from the downstream end of the structures. The fishway will also require a shorter wall for scour protection on the upstream end.  Both structures will need to be joined to the existing structure using grout or an alternative method.<br><br>A 22 foot wide by 0.5 to 1 foot deep low flow channel shall be excavated for approximately 30 to 40 feet upstream from each of the 4 sills that are modified.  This will amount to approximately 34 yards of material.  It is unclear at this time whether the material will need to be removed from the channel or whether it may be repositioned within the scour hole of the next upstream sill.  Access to the work area will be from the south levee.  Approximately a two month in water work window can be used in late summer.

<DESC>Request For Information - Reutilization/Reuse of Government Furnished Equipment
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support is seeking proposals from interested parties for reutilization and re-use of two (2) pieces of Government owned plant equipment (GFE). In order to qualify your firm must hold a current active contract with DLA Troop Support Operational Rations Branch. Please indicate your contract number or numbers and brief description of items supplied when replying to this announcement.</p>
<p>The equipment will be supplied on an as-is, where-is basis and the successful firm will be responsible for rigging, transportation and any costs associated with restoring and upgrading the equipment. Both machines are crated and are in storage in Marengo, Indiana, USA. All equipment will remain the property of the US Government. The agreement for lease and use of the equipment by and between the Government and the successful offeror will be for a period of five (5) years.</p>
<p>The equipment consists of a Raque Heat Sealer and a Tiromat Horizontal Form Fill Seal (HFFS) machine. A report prepared by Rutgers University for DLA Troop Support indicates that the Raque Heat Sealer will require substantial upgrades to its Control System, Evacuation System and In-Feed System. Total cost for these repairs and upgrades is estimated to be approximately $350,000. However, investing this sum will leave this machine in state-of-the-art condition. The Tiromat HFFS machine was upgraded several years ago and it is capable of forming quad film. This machine can be used as is.</p>
<p>Please provide a statement which describes in detail how your firm will use this equipment. Why should DLA Troop Support lease this equipment to you? How will you use it? What problem(s) will it solve? How much monthly rental or lease would you be willing to pay?</p>
<p>Proposals may be submitted electronically to peter.laverghetta@dla.mil by the closing date of Tuesday, May 31 2011. Questions? Email or call (215) 737-7502. Submit a hard copy to:</p>

The FBI has previously made significant investment in purchasing an Automated Liquid Handling Platform with piping systems. This system was specifically customized to meet NDNAU developing automated forensics applications.

<SUBJECT>Potential for Environmental and Therapeutic Agents to Induce Immunotoxicity
<SOLNBR>NIHES2011131(WH)
<RESPDATE>053111
<CONTACT>WANDA M. HOLLIDAY, Contract Specialist, Phone 919-541-0943, Fax 919-541-5117, Email hollida1@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC><strong>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes."</strong>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The National Toxicology Program (NTP) organizes and conducts a comprehensive testing and research program focused on determining potential human health hazards due to exposure to chemicals, drugs or environmental agents. The Toxicology Branch supports these efforts through testing contracts which: (1) develop and establish methods with predictive value for identifying potentially immunotoxic chemicals and drugs; (2) examine selected agents employing a defined panel; and (3) conduct mechanistic studies to define the cellular and molecular events associated with immunotoxicity.<br />Immunotoxicity is used to describe the potential of an environmental agent, therapeutic drug, and in some instances, biological materials, to alter the normal structure and/or function of the immune system as determined by established immunological techniques. Immunotoxicity can be divided into three major research areas: (1) studies of altered hematopoietic or immunological events associated with exposure of humans and animals to chemical or therapeutic agents, including altered host resistance; (2) studies of respiratory or dermal hypersensitivity responses resulting from xenobiotic exposures; and (3) studies on the ability of chemical or therapeutic agents to induce or exacerbate autoimmune disease (Dean et al., 1994). The tasks in any resultant contract will be designed to address these research areas.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this requirement will be to support and assist the efforts of the NTP to determine the effects of certain chemicals, drugs, or other environmental agents on the immune system. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, any resultant contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials (including animals), equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to examine the immune system in laboratory animals following exposure to xenobiotics. The Government will only provide the chemicals or therapeutics on an "as needed basis".</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project requirements</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tasks that will be performed under this requirement involve the utilization of a comprehensive immune testing panel that evaluates the major components of the immune system for potential suppression or enhancement, as well as hypersensitivity and autoimmunity. To screen for the potential of a test article to modulate the systemic immune response, the contractor should be able to assess non-specific, humoral- and cell-mediated immunity using functional measures as described in Luster et al., 1988 (Fundam Appl Toxicol 10:2-19) that quantitate immune system performance. For selected compounds that are demonstrated to be positive in the screening studies, the contractor should be able to assess the performance of the hematopoietic system in generating specific stem cell populations and to evaluate resistance to disease and neoplasia using established models as part of more definitive studies. The contractor should be able to evaluate changes in immune cell numbers and hematological parameters. These endpoints will be evaluated in 4-6 treatment groups of approximately 8 mice or rats following a 28-day adult exposure paradigm or following exposure from approximately day 6 of gestation through post natal day 42. To assess the potential for a test article to induce dermal sensitization, the contractor should be able to evaluate the test compound in 4 treatment groups of 8 mice using a combined irritancy and local lymph node assay, and 4 treatment groups of 8 mice in the mouse ear swelling test. The contractor should also be able to evaluate the potential for selected test articles to alter the development and progression of autoimmune disease using established models. The contractor will be expected to use the appropriate positive controls for each type of study.</p>

<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance<br /></span></strong><br />The Base Contract is anticipated from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2015 with 7 optional 1 year periods of performance. If all options are exercised the period of performance shall extend through June 30, 2022. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other important considerations<br /></span></strong><br />All testing performed under this contract shall be conducted in accordance with GLP guidelines and where appropriate, NTP specifications (NTP, 2011). The contractor must have a currently functioning laboratory with demonstrated capability in conducting immunotoxicity studies. Evaluation of the potential for an individual test article to modulate systemic immunity, hypersensitivity, developmental immunotoxicity and autoimmunity will be considered single tasks with the understanding that multiple immune function tests will be conducted as part of a single task. The actual number of tasks will vary based on programmatic needs and availability of funds. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information sought</span></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Respondents, please provide opinion(s) about the difficulty and/or feasibility of proposing the potential requirement as a fixed price acquisition. Provide possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace for procuring the outlined services under fixed price terms. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission requirements</span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Responses must be received by May 31, 2011, 3:00pm EST.

<SUBJECT>RFI-A COMMERCIAL SOLUTION FOR SOLAR WIND DATA AND CORONAL MASS EJECTION (CME) IMAGERY
<SOLNBR>RFI-NOAADSCOVER
<RESPDATE>063011
<CONTACT>Patricia Mulligan, Email patricia.mulligan@noaa.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Request for Information (RFI)<br /><br />May 17, 2011<br /><br />A COMMERCIAL SOLUTION FOR SOLAR WIND DATA AND CORONAL MASS EJECTION (CME) IMAGERY<br /><br />INTENT OF THIS NOTICE<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY- The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking statements of capabilities from all sources for an upcoming solar wind mission. NOAA is interested in obtaining near-term information demonstrating the viability of long-term commercial solutions (those that are currently available and that could be made commercially available) for a mission that would provide much better value than a government developed system. <br />This Notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No contracts will be awarded as a result of this Notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice or for any follow-up requests for information. NOAA may contact respondents for clarification and discussion of the submitted responses. <br />NOAA will review all documentation provided by each responder. NOAA will use the information provided for a combination of purposes to include present and future planning, and to determine technical feasibility. Responders are strongly cautioned against blanket exclusions from public disclosure, which may present NOAA with difficulty in making any future case for a new procurement. Furthermore, NOAA may release information obtained from responders to interested parties in future competitive acquisitions. <br />If warranted by the information received from this notice, NOAA may consider soliciting for viable no-cost solutions to coincide with the DSCOVR mission described below. Successful commercial participation in the DSCOVR mission could support a NOAA decision to pursue commercial services for solar wind data and coronal mass ejection imagery in the post-DSCOVR era.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />In FY 2012, NOAA is planning to implement a program for acquisition of solar wind data in the near-term. Solar wind data must be acquired at the Lagrangian sun-earth L1 point. Complete requirements are included in Attachment 1. <br />NOAA is seeking data to examine whether our long-term solution for these data types can be a commercial service. Our short-term plan for acquiring these data types is to collaborate with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Air Force (USAF) to refurbish and launch the NASA Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite as early as January 2014. We are seeking to involve commercial vendors in the DSCOVR projects for the purpose of gathering data to evaluate the long-term viability of commercial services for these types of data. We are also interested in data that documents privately supported technical progress in the development of sensors that could meet NOAA requirements described in Attachment 2. NOAA will take the information requested and other marked research into account to determine if a full and open competition for commercial solar wind sources is feasible.<br /><br />DISCUSSION<br /><br />DSCOVR will be a deep space satellite mission operating at the sun-earth L1 point with the following instrumentation: the Plasma sensor and Magnetometer suite (Plas-Mag); the Earth Polychromatic Camera (EPIC); and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Active Cavity Radiometer (NISTAR). The original DSCOVR mission, formerly known as Triana, was built by NASA and placed into storage in 2001. The cost of this mission (in FY 2007 dollars) was approximately $249 million, not including launch costs. Further information on Triana can be found at: <br />http://www-pm.larc.nasa.gov/triana/NAS.Triana.report.12.99.pdf. <br />NOAA plans to receive, process, and use the Plas-Mag to forecast geomagnetic storms. <br /><br />DSCOVR DATA RECEPTION<br /><br />Current planning calls for the use of the NOAA-coordinated international Real Time Solar Wind Network (RTSWnet) to receive all DSCOVR data. Space weather data will be received in real-time at all times. EPIC and NISTAR science data will also be received in real-time when the spacecraft is visible to the NOAA Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) at Wallops, Virginia. During other times the data will be stored and downloaded within 14 hours when next visible to WCDAS. Public outreach imagery (3-channel EPIC images) will be received every 15 minutes when DSCOVR is visible to WCDAS. The schedule of reception for public outreach imagery at non-WCDAS sites is still being determined, but is expected to be similar to the WCDAS schedule. <br /><br />COMMERCIAL ROLE<br /><br />Because NOAA has on-going requirements for solar wind data that will continue after the DSCOVR mission is completed, we need to determine the most cost-effective way to obtain these data over the long-term. One potential approach is to acquire the data through commercial sources. Through this RFI, we are seeking concepts that might leverage the DSCOVR mission to demonstrate the viability of business cases supporting commercial opportunities in the future. <br />Current plans call for NOAA to fund the refurbishment of the DSCOVR satellite and the Plas-Mag sensors, and for NASA to fund the refurbishment of the EPIC and NISTAR. NOAA expects the USAF to fund DSCOVR launch services. Pending the availability of appropriated funds, refurbishment work will be performed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. NOAA's only interest in the mission data is solar wind data. NOAA will not buy data from sensors funded solely with U.S. Government funds. There should be no expectation that either NOAA or NASA will purchase any additional data.</p>
<p>DOCUMENTATION OF INTEREST<br /><br />Responders may document their interest with a letter to the contracting officer. See contact information below. Responders must include detailed technical information and a ROM cost estimate on their business approach; interested firms should provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size.

Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when(1) The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form. With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officers determination with each request for payment; or(4) DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System).(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests.<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

 Description/Specifications/Work Statement

Safe Haven Model Demonstration Project
Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Contract Residential Care
Statement of Work
August 2010

I.          Introduction
The Department of Veterans Affairsâ (VA) Five-Year Plan to End Homelessness Among Veterans calls for enhancing current homeless service capacity as well as developing new programs and initiatives in concert with community and federal partners.  The intent of this Statement of Work (SOW) is for VA medical centers to engage community provider(s) to offer homeless Veterans services through a âSafe Havenâ model of residential care. 

II.         Purpose
Under the contract authority of VAâs Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Contract Residential Care programs, VA medical centers will solicit community organizations to provide âSafe Havenâ services as a âspecialty model.â  This model of HCHV residential care will offer the minimal services under the HCHV Contract Residential Care program enhanced by the services as defined below.  These services must be put forth in the solicitation.  Significant deviation from these services can dilute the model as prescribed, and thus disrupt program evaluation and fidelity studies.  The National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans will provide training for initial program development for both the provider and VA staff.  Additionally, the Center will formulate the evaluation protocol and program fidelity measures.  VA medical centers will contract through procedures in line with their own business practices and contracting services.  Costs associated with Veteran care will be determined by bed days of care, per month.

III.        Policy
The Secretary of the VA has set a zero-tolerance policy for homelessness within the Veteran population.  As part of the Five-Year Plan to End Homelessness Among Veterans, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) intends to increase both capacity of existing programs and services offered to program participants.  This five-year plan calls for utilizing new models of care, not previously offered by VA.

IV.       Background
The VA has been providing direct and specialized services for homeless Veterans for over 20 years.  Beginning in 1987 with 43 pilot programs that provided street outreach and residential community services, VA Homeless Programs have developed and expanded to become the largest integrated provider of homeless services in the country.  Despite these resources, on any given night VA estimates that there are still over 107,000 Veterans who are homeless. 

Recent national trends in service provision for the homeless outside of the VA system include the utilization of Safe Havens as an alternative to shelter care or as a placement post unsuccessful discharge from an inpatient or residential treatment program due to relapse-related issues.  A Safe Haven is a form of supportive housing that serves hard-to-reach homeless persons with severe mental illnesses and/or substance use disorders who are on the streets and have been unable or unwilling to participate in more traditional supportive services.  VA is limited by current grant authorities and existing program structures and practices and cannot fund harm-reduction treatment models.  VA has been unable to provide the types of services focused on shelter diversion and early stabilization in community-based environments and has been criticized by outside organizations for not having this component of the continuum of care. 

V.        Scope of Work
  
1.	Safe Haven provider will offer a 24-hour staffed transitional residence in Massachusetts.  The residence must have 15 beds clustered exclusively for Veterans.  The provider must be able to accommodate both male and female Veterans.  If the residence cannot accommodate both male and female Veterans at one location, the provider must make available equivalent facilities and services for the opposite gender.  The residence must provide onsite laundry, three meals/day, and computer access for Veterans.
2.	Safe Haven provider will target chronically homeless (as defined by HUD) with serious mental illness (as defined by VHA) and substance use problems.
3.	Safe Haven provider will allow VA staff to inspect the facility and/or review Veteran participant treatment protocols at any time determined necessary by VA.
4.	Safe Haven provider will offer a low-demand environment with a minimum set of rules designed to re-establish trust in the chronically homeless Veteran and engage the Veteran in needed treatment services.
a.	Acceptance of treatment cannot be a condition of admission or continued stay.
b.	Abstinence from alcohol or drugs cannot be a condition of treatment or continued stay.
c.	Infractions of rules should be used as opportunities for engagement.
5.	Outreach will be conducted by the Safe Haven provider and VA HCHV staff.
6.	The provider must have the ability to accommodate immediate admissions 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  All admissions must have concurrence of VA.  If a Veteran presents at the facility during weekends or at night, the Safe Haven provider may accept the Veteran, however, VA staff have right of approval/disapproval for payment.
7.	Safe Haven staff will develop a highly individualized treatment plan with each Veteran consistent with low-demand program goals.
8.	Safe Haven provider will encourage Veterans to work towards transitional or permanent housing within six months of admission. All extensions beyond six months will require approval of VA.
9.	Safe Haven provider will collect and maintain evaluation data required by the VA National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans for the Safe Haven Model Demonstration Project.
10.	Safe Haven provider will ensure facility meets all applicable life/safety codes and other standards/compliance requirements as determined by VA, including American with Disabilities Act accessibility.
11.	Safe Haven provider will allow VA staff to inspect the facility and/or review Veteran participant treatment protocols annually and at any time determined necessary by VA.
12.	Safe Haven provider will provide transportation services for Veterans to attend medical appointments, search for transitional or permanent housing and address other care needs.
13.	Safe Haven provider selected for the demonstration project must have at least two years of direct experience as a provider of a Safe Haven Program or program demonstrating the low-demand model.  Safe Haven provider selected for the demonstration project must be able to provide onsite office space for one full-time VA Safe Haven Coordinator.
14.	Safe Haven Provider will provide newly admitted Veterans with all necessary furnishings and clean linens. Basic toiletries will be provided for all Veteran residents. 
15.	Safe Haven Provider will ensure that all meals provided are nutritious and that food items will remain available throughout the day. 
16.	Safe Haven Provider will ensure that the facilities are well maintained and clean.
17.	Safe Have Provider will participate in annual homeless events sponsored by the VAMC, i.e. Local Stand Down Events. 
18.	Safe Haven Provider will be knowledgeable of local VA and non-VA Homeless Programs and maintain a willingness to collaborate with other Providers as it benefits the Veterans. 
19.	Safe Haven Provider will have a site currently available to implement the Safe Haven Model. 
20.	Safe Haven Provider will be willing to participate in data collection activities which will assist in monitoring the effectiveness of the program as well as determine any needed modifications.  

VI.	Location of Performance

Work will be performed at the contractorâs facilities in the Massachusetts. Government furnished workspace will not be provided for this effort.  However, the contractor will be required to attend frequent meetings and planning sessions at the medical center.

<DESC>HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />SBA Subject Matter Expert Conference<br />PROPOSED DATES ARE FIRM FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 2011 THROUGH FRIDAY, JUNE 17, 2011
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's Lead Lender Relations Specialists and supervisors and senior leaders from the Office of Capital Access and Office of Field Operations, which must accommodate 120 attendees.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long term strength of the SBA as a high performing organization is critically linked to our frontline leaders. For an organization of SBA's size, our frontline leaders are critical to the organization's ability to be nimble and successful. Contributing to this success includes shared goals and operating systems that reflect these values in our systems, procedures, training, product development, and most importantly, our organizational culture. This conference will be the first step in that direction.</p>
<p>The three goals of this conference are:</p>
<p>1) To review SBA's progress on the training curriculum developed last year during the subject matter conference;</p>
<p>2) To review progress related to the core competencies for frontline employees to deliver lending products and services developed jointly by program office SMEs, Center Directors, and frontline SME practitioners; and</p>
<p>3) To review statistics to determine if SBA is making progress in t he transfer of subject matter knowledge to succeeding Lending Relations Specialists.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND<br />The SBA Subject Matter Expert Conference is aimed at SBA's Lead Lender Relations Specialists, supervisors, and senior leaders from the Office of Capital Access and Office of Field Operations. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, June 12th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, June 13th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, June 13th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event, the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 120 participants. Likewise, SBA may need a second smaller work room to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, both rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference, therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 120 adults. The second meeting room shall be required to comfortably accommodate 15 to 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference. Spaces shall be clean, well ventilated, well lit, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Guest rooms will be individually occupied. All must have flat screen TVs, included Internet access, and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request. Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $105/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations.

<p>Sunday, June 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10<br />Monday, June 13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 120<br />Tuesday, June 14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120<br />Wednesday, June 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120<br />Thursday, June 16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120<br />Friday, June 17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depart</p>
<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>
<p>Hotel on-site parking available to accommodate 20 participants' vehicles at no additional charge.</p>
<p>A hotel airport shuttle service is preferred; however if no shuttle service is provided, the hotel will provide information on other airport transportation options.</p>

Presentation of food should be visually appealing, colorful, and offer a good variety of nutritional value and selection at each meal and snack. Government meals for breakfast, lunch and breaks are directed and provided to all SBA employees during the training events. Employees' meal per diem allowance will be reduced for all government provided meals. All meals/food/beverage costs are not to exceed the federal governments' St Louis per diem rates ($11 - breakfast, $16 - lunch) per day. Meals will be served (buffet style preferred) at predetermined times as during normal meal hours as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date. However, due to the nature of training, the parties anticipate the need to have some reasonable flexibility in actual meal schedules as not to disrupt the training.</p>
<p>Fast and easy check-in and check-out capabilities are required. With 120 conference attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently. Luggage storage is required if guestrooms are not available for early check-in (11:00 am arrival). The hotel shall allow confirmed guest reservations to arrive up until 11:00 pm of the first day. SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>
<p>The front desk shall be prepared to provide basic information on the proximity of outside dining establishments as the group will likely be released nightly to enjoy dinner outside of the event facility.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman - Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman - Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Use of a informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Sponges. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. Vendor will be required to identify in initial response for which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs</strong>:</p>
<p>1<strong>. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR) for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <strong>Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias,MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8537; Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Sponges. Within The MMESO West estimated total annual demand for this product line is approximately $977,002 based on PV usage data over 12 months of recent usage. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North: $126,609; MMESO South: $523,972; MMESO West: $110,205; MMESO Europe: $103,958; and MMESO Pacific: $112,258. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top twenty one (21) lines items of the total sixty two (62) line items, account for 81.3% ($794,361) of the total volume in sales ($977,002) in the MMESOs, and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 21 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr.@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding and (4) Identification of which MMESO AOR(s) vendor intends to submit pricing for. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendors must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendors who do not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Surgical Sponges products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for Surgical Sponges: sterile, woven, latex free, and contain an integrated radiopaque indicator, and will include at a minimum:<br />a. <br />GAUZE SPONGE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 4" X 8", 12 PLY, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 4x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 18x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Surgical Sponges</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFAIQ with initial submittal. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Surgical Sponges product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. Vendors without a DAPA number or those that have not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Medical/Surgical prime vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor for Surgical Sponges or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who have not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />4. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for the products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.)<br />5. Vendor must identify with initial submittal which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes for. Vendor will not have an opportunity to change MMESO AOR(s) during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Evaluation <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</span> Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) packages of each size and configuration of products listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>GAUZE SPONGE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 4" X 8", 12 PLY, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 4x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 18x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate product samples from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nineteen (19) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The surgical sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01)<br />2. The surgical sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />3. The radiopaque material is attached securely to the sponge and is readily visible to the eye.(Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />4. The surgical sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01)<br />5. Any color or dyed part of the surgical sponge does not come off on your gloved hand when the sponge is wet or dry. (Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />6. The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage)<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR.<strong> Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that were identified in Technical Requirements, above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR.</strong> The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 - RA1341-11-RQ-0501BS
<p>The purpose of this Amendment 2 is to extend the response date and to provide the following question and request for clarification and the responses to both:</p>
<p>Question 1:<br />Can you get clarification of the need for a Tech Spec 1 which states the Sodar must be capable of operating with AC Power only, but in Line Items 0006 &amp; 0007 calls for an AC Charger and a deep cycle battery. Why would you need these if it is an AC Power only unit?</p>
<p>Answer 1:<br />The primary power source is AC power. This is fed through the AC charger to charge the battery. The sodar itself operates off of DC power supplied from the battery. In the event of a power outage, the battery provides backup power for several hours to reduce the chance of lost operational time while AC power is being restored.</p>
<p>Question 2:<br />After reading #9 of the requested Verification of Compliance we felt that the question was ambiguous. Can you have the technical team clarify what parameters of they would like to control.</p>
<p>Answer 2:<br />Standard operating parameters such as averaging time, range (height), and range gate interval are among the settings that could be potentially adjusted to improve resolution and data recovery. For this project, averaging time and gate interval will be fixed at 10 minutes and 10 m and will not be available for making any adjustments to improve data quality. However, there are other parameters that the user might adjust to improve data quality and recovery. Examples of these could include adjusting transmit frequency, pulse length, power, temperature setting, and vertical velocity correction.</p>
<p>The response date is extended to May 18, 2011, 12:00 Noon, MDT.</p>

<a href="mailto:stephanie.d.randall@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Kansas City</a>
<DESC><br>Para. 1 is deleted in its entirety from the original synopsis. <br><br>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission.  This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase A of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA). These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located within Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2 (which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and the NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts). In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to five (5) unrestricted firms sharing $150 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than five (5) contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all. <br><br>This announcement is unrestricted and open to all businesses, regardless of size. The period of performance for each contract will include a base period of three (3) years and one option period of two (2) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than August 2011. Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity. These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years. Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $150 million over the life of the contracts. <br><br>Large businesses selected will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.  The USACE subcontracting goals, which will be considered in the negotiation of the contracts, are: a minimum of 50% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Businesses (SB) with 17% of that to Small Disadvantage Businesses (SDB), 18% to Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), 10% to Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZones), 8.5% to Veteran-owned, and 4% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB (SDVOSB). <br><br>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less. More than one contract will be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts. When a requirement is identified, the government will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing HTRW/environmental project. Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. If a follow-on requirement, determination of the selected A-E will be conducted considering a firm's experience, qualifications, capability, and capacity to perform the work. For new requirements, the project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order. An evaluation will also be conducted to determine if a small business is capable of performing the work. Experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity will be considered to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work. <br><br>The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for the three (3) year base period; in addition there is a provision for one two (2) year option period; if the option period is exercised, the length of the contract will be five (5) years. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined relative to the employee's office location rather than the location of work.  <br><br>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a D-U-N-S number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220. D&B can be reached by calling 1-866-705-5711. Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the FAR and previously found in solicitations. Detailed information can be found in the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance. Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-100 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website  http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNs number.<br><br>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for Superfund projects in EPA Region 2. Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Assignments will include, but not be limited to: site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to: contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems and habitat restoration and mitigation. For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<br><br>3. Selection Criteria: (A) Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:           (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm's team demonstrated during the past five (5) years in the broad range of environmental work required for this contract including (a) Investigation, planning, design, and construction phase services for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste cleanup projects. Experience must demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities for diverse projects with differing contaminants in various media. EPA Region 2 Superfund projects will have greater importance; (b) Knowledge of and adherence to regulations and practices pertaining to hazardous waste sampling, handling, transportation and disposal including Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA), and (National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Experience within EPA Region 2 jurisdiction will have greater importance; (c) Oversight of Remedial Investigation, Feasibility Study, Remedial Design, Remedial Action, and Long Term Response Action projects performed by other parties, in conformance to their respective consent decrees or administrative orders negotiated with EPA; (d) Demonstrated quality management procedures. The effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will be considered within quality management; (e) Capability in managing cost-reimbursable contracts. The prime A-E firm will demonstrate adequate experience with a cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable contracts. Firms will be evaluated for the degree in which their team possesses experience and competence in these areas (a through e, above). The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of these areas; (2) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, training, registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience of personnel working together with key management and other technical personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these primary disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. List professional registrations, if applicable, for the key disciplines: (a) Project Management (b) Chemical Process Engineering; (c) Chemistry; (d) Hydrogeology ; (e) Risk Assessment; (f) Environmental Engineering (g) Civil Engineering; (h) Geotechnical Engineering; (i) Industrial Hygiene; (j) Health Physics; (k) Cost Engineering; (l) Geology; (m) Archaeology; (n) Biology; (o) Mechanical Engineering; (p) Electrical Engineering; (q) Architecture/Landscape Planning; and (r) Structural Engineering; (3 ) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) is the primary source of information on past performance. ACASS will be queried for all firms submitting a proposal. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from ACASS. The board will consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance. A firm that has earned excellent evaluations on recent DoD A-E contracts for similar size, scope, and complexity of projects will be ranked relatively high on past performance; (4) Capacity. The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above from the prime firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time; (5) Knowledge of the locality. The board will evaluate a firm's familiarity with local conditions. Examples include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the state and local regulatory agencies, geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located in both EPA Region 2 and the USACE NWD. (B) Secondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The two secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance: (1) SB and SDB Participation. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions ( MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration. Large businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507. For informational purposes, the small business size is defined by the limits of NAICS Code 541330.   (2) Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. Please indicate all task orders and modifications awarded your firm by DoD agencies within the last twelve (12) months under an indefinite delivery type contract. Indicate date of task orders and fee for each. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. <br><br>4. Submittal Requirements:  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies of SF 330 (06/2004 edition) for the prime firm and all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number in SF 330, Part I, Section B, Block 4. For the ten (10) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed pursuant to one specific task order of an IDC at one site or multiple sites at a single installation or facility, or work performed pursuant to a site-specific contract for one site or multiple sites within a single installation or facility.  An IDC, or the performance of work pursuant to multiple task orders of an IDC, does not represent a "project" within this definition. If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number and the task order number for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes. Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. Section H is limited to twenty (20) pages with double-sided sheets counting as two pages. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. font. No spiral bound documents shall be submitted. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal.<br> <br>Submittals must be mailed or delivered to the following address not later than July 1, 2011, 4:00 pm Central Time (no faxed or other electronic submittals will be accepted):<br><br>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District <br>Attn: CECT-NWK-H (Stephanie Randall) <br>601 East 12th Street<br>Kansas City, MO 64106-2896<br><br>(816) 389-3965<br><br>Submit questions, in writing only, to Stephanie Randall at stephanie.d.randall@usace.army.mil.  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a Shoe Scanning Device (SSD) System. The SSD system will be capable of detecting threat objects concealed in footwear without requiring passengers to remove their footwear as they pass through a security checkpoint. These threat objects include a wide variety of military, commercial, and homemade explosives or explosives devices. Further background information regarding the SSD program is provided at the bottom of this announcement.
<p>The estimated release date for the solicitation is in&nbsp;the week of&nbsp;16 May, 2011. The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on this same FedBizOps webpage, with the exception of RFP attachments which are considered either Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or Classified National Security Information (CNSI), respectively. In order to be approved to view to these documents upon RFP release, a contractor must meet the requirements and complete the steps listed below prior to 04 April 2011. Non-compliance will not render a contractor ineligible to submit a proposal. Contractors can continue to submit their request for SSI and/or CNSI access no later than 03 June 2011, however, the documents might not be provided upon RFP release. <br /><br />SSI:<br />1. Provide the CAGE code of the Contractor's facility that will manage the proposal.<br />2. Designate a Senior Corporate Official, who is responsible for serving as the single point of contact for SSI and certifying to the Contracting Officer every 60 days that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information.&nbsp;The designation must be stated&nbsp;in a letter&nbsp;format and signed by the Senior Corporate Official.<br />3. Provide the following information for all individuals who need to view SSI; provide this information via email in one password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and send the password in a separate email:<br />a. Contractor/Subcontractor name<br />b. Employee Full Name<br />c. Employee Gender<br />d. Employee Birth Date<br />e. Employee Citizenship<br />f. Employee Social Security Number <br />4. Provide a fully completed and witnessed non-disclosure agreement for all employees who need to view SSI. Use the attached form entitled "Non-Disclosure Agreement."<br />5. Contractors are limited to 35 individuals (inclusive of any subcontractors) who can have access to SSI.<br />6. Only one list of individuals may be submitted. No revisions will be permitted.</p>
<p>CNSI:<br />1. Contractors must have a facility clearance (FCL) at the Secret level and receive a DD-254 from the Government. <br />2. As applicable, contractors must provide information requested by the Government in order to complete any required DD-254, and must follow any instructions contained therein after issuance.<br />3. The Government will use the contractor's CAGE code (provided per the above SSI instructions) to determine the contractor's FCL status.</p>
<p>All information must be emailed to Minh-Ha.Do@dhs.gov and Lance.Nyman@dhs.gov.</p>
<p>The attached documents entitled "Synopsis - SSD - Further Pre-Solicitation SSI Information" and "Synopsis - SSD - Further CNSI Information" contain further information concerning SSI and CNSI, respectively.</p>
<p><br />SSD PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) currently requires that all passenger footwear be removed and scanned by X-ray machines as part of the checkpoint screening process. The removal of footwear takes time, reduces the efficiency of the checkpoint, creates safety concerns with footwear removal and contributes to passenger dissatisfaction. In addition, scanning footwear through the X-ray machine increases the volume of items that the Transportation Security Officers (TSO) at the X-ray machine must visually screen.</p>
<p>Currently 98% of passengers must remove their footwear for screening in the X-ray machine. The high-level goals of the SSD program include:<br />&bull; Achieving the current level of screening capabilities provided by the current Advanced Technology (AT)-2 X-ray machine baseline;<br />&bull; Reducing the number of passengers required to remove their footwear;<br />&bull; Performing screening without increasing TSO staffing levels. <br />&bull; Improve the TSA's ability to screen passengers by increasing probability of detection, expanding detection capability to the full threat list defined in the Classified Requirement Document and reducing the probability of a false alarm.<br />&bull; Increase overall operational throughput by reducing the system scanning time required to process an individual and design the system for ease of movement of passengers to allow for intuitive operation.<br />&bull; Improve reliability, availability, and maintainability by designing the system for quick access to perform preventative maintenance and unscheduled maintenance without needing to move the system. <br />&bull; Preclude the need for preventative maintenance at an unreasonable level (under seven days) or require custom tools to perform preventative maintenance.<br />&bull; Improve deployability of the system by accommodating adaptation to the varying environmental conditions in airports and storage facilities (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude, etc.).</p>

Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may override negative trends.<br>	The Government may collect information from references provided by the offeror in regard to its past performance (See below elements that should be addressed).    References other than those identified by the offeror and the information received will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.<br>	The offeror must provide the information requested for performance risk evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no directly related or similar past performance.  Firms lacking relevant past performance shall receive an "unknown" evaluation for performance risk.	<br>	Evaluation of past performance will be as objective as possible based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.
