<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities and major repair and alteration projects in northern California.  This area extends from the northern California border down to and including the counties of Monterey, Kings, Tulare and Inyo.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet and are categorized as Carrier Annexes, Postal Retail Facilities, Delivery Distribution Centers, Main Post Offices, Stations or Branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the area over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 15,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  background information, backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations.  The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual.  (2) Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed, expanded, repaired, or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.  (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  The list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review annually.  This solicitation is a re-issue of a solicitation issued in FY02 and is part of the annual review process currently underway.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to nancy.young@usps.gov or skip.lee@usps.gov or grace.b.zipagan@usps.gov.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified design/build general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities and major repair and alteration projects in southern California.  This area extends from the southern California border up to and including the counties of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with a construction cost of $1.0 million to $7.5 million and are categorized as Carrier Annexes, Postal Retail Facilities, Delivery Distribution Centers, Main Post Offices, Stations or Branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of design-build experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the area over the past five years.  Comparable projects are defined for the purpose of this solicitation as design/build new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 15,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  background information, backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations.  The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any design/build firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual.  (2) Prequalify additional design/build firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed, expanded, repaired, or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.  (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  The list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review annually.  This solicitation is a re-issue of a solicitation issued in FY02 and is part of the annual review process currently underway.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to nancy.young@usps.gov or skip.lee@usps.gov or grace.b.zipagan@usps.gov.  Qualification Statement packages will be sent via return email to the requestor.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Flight material/hardware and labor to fabricate the following items: (3) each of 96M12270-1A-900, END CAP, VENT (-900 means minus drawing notes 9, 10, 11, 17) and (3) each 96M12271-1A-900, END CAP, SWITCH (-900 means minus drawing notes 9, 10, 11, 17).  This presolicitation is for information purposes per FAR 9.202 and is subject to U.S. Export Controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and Export Administration regulations.  This acquisition will utilize only evaluated suppliers audited by MSFC independent outsourcing quality and manufacturing representative(s) as outlined below.  These vendors are solicited on a rotating basis based on type of work, flight/quality requirements, and capability from the Audited Vendors List (AVL).  Vendors interested in being qualified for future acquisitions must adhere to the following requirements:  Audited Vendor’s List (AVL) - To be added to the list for production of flight, quality, and/or critical products/services, an interested company must be a small business with 500 or less employees, must be located within a 100-mile radius of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) or within the same major city and/or county of the city and county and must be ISO 9000 compliant.  Vendors on the AVL undergo a full quality management system audit compliant to MSFC requirements as outlined in Marshall Work Instruction (MWI) 5330.1, “Evaluation of Contractors, Suppliers, and Vendors,” on-site at the contractor’s facility by the MSFC independent outsourcing quality and manufacturing representative(s).  An Export Control Process must be submitted along with the requested information to qualify, please see ITAR, 22CFR, Parts 120-130 for further guidance.  All offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be eligible for award.  Firms that recognize and can produce the required item described above are encouraged to identify themselves for possible future acquisitions. Once a vendor has passed this audit, other NASA and prime contractor personnel use the web-based list to obtain products and services other than the outsourcing acquisitions discussed herein.  Limited Vendor’s List (LVL) - To be added to the list for production of non-flight, non-flight support, and/or non-safety critical products/services, an interested company must be a small business with 500 or less employees, must be located within a 100-mile radius of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) or within the same major city and/or county of the city and county and must complete the MSFC Form 4446 survey and return to Vic Scheuplein as indicated below, and must be evaluated on-site at the contractor’s facility by the MSFC outsourcing quality and manufacturing representative(s) to ensure they have the capability to supply build-to-print products/services to MSFC. Vendors are on notice that there are limited government resources (time, personnel and funds) to perform these audits.  Priority for the audits will be given to companies who offer capabilities and/or processes most required by NASA MSFC. All other requests will be processed as resources permit.  Each year or when all vendors have had an opportunity to quote in cases where the list may be extensive, whichever is more practicable, a new sources sought synopsis may be issued to refresh the AVL and LVL lists.	At that time, vendors who have previously requested an audit but who have not been audited must respond to the new synopsis to indicate continued interest.  The Limited Vendor’s List is intended as a stepping-stone for vendors who may not be currently ISO compliant and provides them with an opportunity to do business with MSFC/NASA while upgrading their quality management system.  Vendors on the AVL may be utilized for non-flight work as necessary but vendors on the LVL may not be utilized for flight quality-sensitive work.	Generally, MSFC’s solicitations for this type work will be restricted to vendors on the AVL or LVL due to audit requirements.  This acquisition contains data with highly sensitive technology and is restricted for release outside the United States.  This information cannot be released outside the United States without prior approval of The Government.  This Acquisition contains Technical Data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751 ET SEQ) or The Export Administration Act (Title 50, U.S.C., APP 2401-2402) Executive Order 121470.   This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See note 26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1.  Quotes will be solicited from small business vendors on the Approved Vendors List (AVL) at MSFC as described above. The anticipated release date of RFQ 8-4200090161 is on or about December 22, 2004 with an anticipated quote due date of on or about January 17, 2005.   An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.	  All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax) to Kimberly S. Daniels, 256-544-0609; fax 256-544-3223; email Kimberly.s.daniels@nasa.gov not later than December 16, 2004.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS

Synopsis:  PRESOLICITATION NOTICE

The Transportation Security Administration’s Office of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing (OTVC) intends to competitively seek offers to provide OTVC with the following:

1.	Credit Reports.  The contractor obtains credit reports on subjects of investigations from each of three national credit bureaus; the contractor edits the reports to eliminate redundant information; the contractor then structures the credit report so that like accounts are reported together (e.g., all collections associated with the original lends are located together, etc.); and, finally, the contractor identifies if the subject meets TSA’s financial suitability criteria.  When an individual does not meet TSA’s financial suitability criteria, the contractor prepares a draft letter for TSA’s use in notifying the person of the financial issues.

2.	Criminal History Checks.  The contractor is responsible for identifying and reporting all state, county, and local law enforcement records involving the subject for the most recent ten years.  The contractor is encouraged to use the most efficient and effective procedures available for obtaining these records.  If no other method is available, the contractor is responsible for physically obtaining the law enforcement records from courthouses serving the area(s) in which the subject has lived, worked, and attended educational institutions in the most recent ten years.

If the criminal record check identifies that the subject has one or more of 28 specific disqualifying offenses, the contractor drafts a letter for TSA’s use in notifying the subject of the issue(s).  

3.	Falsification Check.  The contractor identifies instance in which the subject’s responses to questions 23, 24, 27 – 29 on the SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, are inconsistent with the results of the subject’s credit report and criminal history check.  If so, the contractor reports the potential falsification issue by citing the SF 86 item and the report that contains the discrepant information.

4.	Electronic Reports.  The contractor is responsible for establishing an electronically accessible system, such as websites, for providing TSA with PIs and PI components that are organized by TSA regions and, within each region, by the results of the PI.

The Government currently anticipates the award of a single indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery type contract with a base period of performance and three additional one-year options.  
This solicitation will contain a source selection factor requiring large businesses to participate in the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program.  In order to receive credit under the source selection factor, the offeror must provide, with their proposal, a signed letter of mentor-protégé agreement approval from the DHS OSDBU.  Information on the DHS Mentor Protégé Program can be found on the DHS web site (www.dhs.gov) under "Business".

Special Requirements:  Each employee of the Contractor shall be a citizen of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by Alien Registration Receipt Card Form I-151, or who presents other evidence from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that employment will not affect his/her immigration status.

For all interested parties, additional information and a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) regarding this announcement will be issued on or about December 17, 2004.  All responsible vendors are encouraged to submit offers.  Competition for this procurement is full and open.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), San Diego, intends to procure  a dual-frequency, PC-based acoustic imaging sonar system for installation aboard U.S. submarines.  Included in the requirement will be two software seats/licenses for the operation of the system plus training for two people.  The system will be procured on an other than full and open competition basis  from Colmek Systems Engineering, Salt Lake City, UT.   The CodaOctopus, LTD Echoscope V2 Acoustic Imaging Sonar is the only manufactured instrument that meets the physical, mechanical, and operational requirements for installation on top of the sail aboard U.S. submarines.  The physical characteristics are the size of the external components that have to be mounted to the sail, where the space available for components is extremely limited.  The mechanical characteristics include "off-the-shelf" component configuration that makes adaptation for installation reasonable.  The operational character! istics that are unique include dual-frequency operation of the sonar as well as a software package capable of displaying 3D images real-time.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipted with a six month delivery date.  Commercial procedures are being used.   RFQ N00244-05-T-0177 will be issued about 8 December 2004 and will close about 22 December 2004 at 1pm.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the specification requirements stated above and in the RFQ.     All proposals received before the closing date of the RFQ will be considered by the Government for the purposes of determining whether to compete the requirement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to negotiate an extension contract to the Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC), an ongoing, longitudinal follow up to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).     The goal of the DCCT, a multi-centered clinical trial that ran from 1982 until 1993 and involved 1441 patients with Type 1 Diabetes, was to investigate the early microvascular and neurologic complications of Type 1 Diabetes and whether intensive insulin treatment would prevent and/or ameliorate those complications.     The main results of the DCCT have been reported (NEJM, September 30, 1993).     In EDIC the surviving participants from the DCCT cohort are followed longitudinally to study the long-term effects of prior separation of glycemic levels, risk factors for macrovascular outcomes, and the correlation of progression of micro- and macrovascular outcomes.     
Ongoing EDIC assessments include:     biochemical analyses of blood specimens to ascertain renal and metabolic status, electrocardiography, ultrasonography and coronary artery calcification studies by computed tomography to determine macrovascular disease; and stereo fundus photography to ascertain retinal status.     The DCCT/EDIC Study Group has published a combined 90 reports and has produced an additional 150 presentations and abstracts based on the research findings (see Attachment 1).     Planned future assessments include cardiac NMR imaging, blood and urine proteomics, and repeat neuropathy screening.     Continued long-term follow-up of the currently active 1354 EDIC participants (see Attachment 2) will provide important scientific information on late macrovascular complications that have only recently begun to be observed in this cohort.     

The George Washington University Biostatistics Center has served as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for DCCT/EDIC since 1982.     The following describes the expertise of The Biostatistics Center and its collaborators and their contributions to DCCT and to EDIC.

EXPERTISE IN BIOSTATISTICS AND DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY       The Principal Investigator of the Data Coordinating Center at the GWU Biostatistics Center since the inception of the DCCT in 1982 is John Lachin, Professor of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, and of Statistics. Dr. Lachin has authored three books on biostatistical methods, over 55 articles on statistical and clinical trials methodology, an additional 30 articles of medical research results; and is a corporate author of over 100 additional articles published by research groups in which he had participated. Since the inception of the DCCT, Ms Patricia Cleary has served as Deputy Director, and now Director, of the Coordinating Center.     Dr. Lachin and/or Ms. Cleary have been an author of virtually all of the published reports from DCCT/EDIC and have each chaired writing committees for many of these reports.     In addition, both Dr. Lachin and Ms. Cleary have given presentations of DCCT/EDIC results to the annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association, the International Diabetes Federation, and the International Diabetes Epidemiology Group, among others. Dr. Lachin and Ms. Cleary are recognized internationally as experts in the epidemiology of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 
Dr. Lachin, often in collaboration with leading theoretical statisticians, has also developed statistical methods that have been employed in the design of DCCT and EDIC and the analysis of DCCT/EDIC results. These include statistical methods for the repeated interim analysis of the emerging results from the DCCT and EDIC, methods for the analysis of interval censored event-time data with time-dependent covariates, among others.
In addition, the Biostatistics Center (BSC) of The George Washington University has extensive experience with diabetes trials and longitudinal epidemiologic studies.     
The DCCT/EDIC Study has taken a leading position in studying the role of genetics in the development of diabetes.       Assessments of familial aggregation were performed during DCCT and will be repeated in EDIC in order to test whether DNA variation in a number of candidate genes is related to susceptibility to diabetes and its complications.     To this end, DNA is being collected from all available parents of DCCT/EDIC participants and at least one full non-diabetic sibling.     In addition, measures of diabetic complications are also being assessed on diabetic siblings of participants.     The DCC is currently initiating the establishment of a repository of DNA samples from the DCCT/EDIC participants and their relatives.     Mechanisms for accessing these samples by qualified researchers are also being generated.

PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE       All procedures necessary for data collection, editing, and processing; and for the maintenance of permanent study files and documentation related to the DCCT/EDIC database are implemented by the DCC staff as specified in the Internal Procedures Manual and in accordance with HIPAA regulations.     The DCC professional and technical staff includes the principal and co-principal investigators, database manager, statisticians, programmers, technology and web support specialists, research assistants, contractual, financial and administrative specialists, and data entry clerks.     Overall, the DCC staff has expertise in statistics, programming (SAS and FoxPro), contract and sub-recipient agreement management, clinical trials management as well as web site development and maintenance.

COMPUTING FACILITY       The DCC utilizes the computing infrastructure of the George Washington University Biostatistics Center.     At the core of the computing infrastructure is an IBM Multiprise 3000, S/390 class enterprise server.     This server acts as the central data warehouse for all data received for the DCCT/EDIC study.     The server provides one of the most fault tolerant, secure and stable platforms available in the industry.     Access to the computing facility is restricted to Biostatistics Center staff.     All access is monitored and logged.     Unauthorized access is prevented by way of account deactivation and is monitored 24 hours a day.     Data stored for the DCCT/EDIC study is kept separate from other studies conducted by the Biostatistics Center.     Access to the DCCT/EDIC data is restricted to the DCC staff and is password protected.     Physical site security is maintained by way of electronic access key entry system and closed circuit video cameras.

DATA SECURITY       Data is stored on the enterprise server and is accessible to DCC staff for analysis and reporting needs.     All data for the DCC is backed up on a daily basis.     Dozens of backups are maintained for extended period of time so that they would reflect the state of the databases and files at various points in time.     Extensive systems are in place to ensure proper backup of all information so that data loss is prevented.     All desktop systems are backed up using a central backup server.     Disaster recovery measures have been taken to prevent data loss in the event of a catastrophic disaster.     All data and files stored on the enterprise server and various network file servers are backed up to tape and sent off-site to a remote location where they are kept in an environmentally controlled safe.     In addition, designated desktop computers that house particularly important information participate in this off-site disaster recovery program.     

PROJECT, CONTRACTUAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT     The Administrative Group of the Biostatistics Center has extensive experience handling the various contractual mechanisms necessary including:     government and subcontract contracts, clinic, and consulting and service agreements.     The Administrative and Programming group have also developed an automated system to generate clinic reimbursement reports and payment requests linked to receipt of central laboratory data.     This system is programmed to interface with the University payment system.     The DCC also coordinates the existing subcontracts and service agreements with central laboratories, reading centers and coding units needed to perform subject assessments in accordance with study protocol.     

FORM DESIGN AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT       Sixty-eight EDIC forms and Twenty-four Genetic Studies forms were designed and developed by DCC staff for data collection, adverse event verification, patient status notification, certification of technicians, and mailing status.     Using SAS FSEDIT, software was developed and is maintained by DCC programming staff for data entry and data editing of EDIC forms.       Procedures used to create the data entry system include: creation of fifty-three map files and range edit files, software development to integrate map files and range edit files, software development to create main menus and selection menus for new and continuing data entry, software development to produce 131 data entry screens, one data entry screen for each page of a form for all forms, software development to create fifty-three driver programs, procedures to integrate data entry screens and driver programs into FSP, and procedures to incorporate text files into the SCL application using Interactive SAS.     
FoxPro was used to design and develop data entry screens for Genetic Studies data collection forms.     Procedures for software development using FoxPro include: creation of data dictionaries with finalized data structures and set requirement levels with logical ranges, uploading the data dictionaries to the mainframe, preparation for data entry by building an executable file that when launched will give the end user the data entry screens for keying, uploading keyed FoxPro files to the mainframe and executing the production program.     In addition to FoxPro software, SAS software was used for Genetic Studies to develop programs to integrate FoxPro data dictionaries and data files keyed in FoxPro, into SAS datasets on the mainframe.     The Genetic Studies Database Management System consists of 48 data entry screens.     The EDIC ancillary study URO-EDIC, also keyed in FoxPro, consists of 12 data entry screens.     
A separate data dictionary, and separate files containing valid ranges for each variable, were generated and are maintained by DCC Database Management staff for both EDIC and Genetic Studies data collection forms.     The DCC has 84 master files for the EDIC and EDIC Genetics Forms, some forms with as many as 5 versions.     The number of records for each file ranges between 5 and 8,530; and the number of variables in each file ranges between 12 and 466.     A list of all of the EDIC and EDIC Genetics Forms is attached to this document (see Attachment 3).     In addition, summary listings of the master files for the EDIC and EDIC Genetics Forms data are attached to this document (see Attachment 4).
Programs and systems have also been written and established to interface with, convert, receive, batch, check, scan and/or process data receive and process information received from the central coding and reading units.     A summary list of the master files for EDIC Central Reading Unit data is attached to this document (see Attachment 5). The procedures utilized at the DCC for receiving and processing this data is summarized below:

             The Central Ophthalmologic Reading Unit:
Fundus Photographic data is received via diskette from the Central Ophthalmologic Reading Unit, for both EDIC and EDIC Genetic Studies, and uploaded to the mainframe.     SAS Software is used to process the raw data and create a Master File.     SAS Software is also used to produce patient feedback reports based on Fundus Photograph and Visual Acuity data. 
           
                 The Central Biochemistry Laboratory:
EDIC CBL Data is received via diskette and uploaded to the mainframe.     SAS Software is used to process the raw CBL data and create a Master File. SAS Software is used to produce patient feedback reports based on CBL data.     EDIC Genetic Studies CBL Data is received via FTP at a secured web address.     SAS Software is used to process the raw CBL data and create a Master File.     SAS Software is also used to produce patient feedback reports based on CBL data.

The Central ECG Reading Unit:
Copies of ECG tracings are received via mail from the Clinical Centers.     The ECG tracings are batched by a Data Control Clerk and mailed to the ECG Reading Unit for processing.     Two types of ECG data are received via diskette from the ECG reading Unit: the raw Minnesota Code data and the ECG Serial Change Comparison data.     Separate SAS programs are used to process the data, and separate master files created.     SAS Software is used to generate patient feedback reports based on ECG data.

The Central Ultrasound Reading Unit:
Carotid Ultrasound data is received via email from the Central Ultrasound Reading Unit.     Raw data is processed using SAS Software and a Master File was created.     SAS Software was used to generate patient feedback reports.

           The Central Food Frequency Recall Unit:
Food Frequency Questionnaires are mailed from the Clinical Centers to the Data Coordinating Center.     Questionnaires are checked, batched, and mailed to the Central Food Frequency Recall Unit for scanning and processing.     Food Frequency Data was previously received via diskette and are now being received via email.     SAS Software is used to process the raw data and create a Master File for Food Frequency Questionnaire data.

           The Central Computed Tomography Reading Unit:
Data was received via EUDORA and uploaded to the mainframe.     SAS Software was used to process CT Scan data and create a Master File.     SAS Software was used to edit CT Scan data based on specifications received from the CT Reading Unit.     Patient feedback reports based on CT Scan data were generated and mailed to the Clinical Centers for distribution to the patients.     New data values were received from the CT Reading Unit based on adjustments to existing data.     SAS Software was used to incorporate the new data values into the Master File for CT Scan data.
Invoices were generated for payment of CT Scans along with several reports tracking payments for CT Scans.     

All software used for data entry and data editing for EDIC and Genetic Studies was designed and developed internally, by the DCC EDIC Database Management staff and are not available commercially.     

DATA MANAGEMENT       Over the past 20 years, the DCC has developed an extensive and well-established central data entry system and quality control procedures for receiving, checking, entering and verifying data to be entered into its central data entry system from the 28 EDIC clinical centers.     Forms are mailed from each of the 28 clinic sites in monthly mailings.     The procedures for receiving and processing the data from these forms are summarized below:     

Each of the 28 EDIC clinic centers mail all completed forms once a month on the Thursday of the week designated for each clinic.     When forms arrive at the Data Coordinating Center, the number and types of forms received is compared to the number and types of forms sent by the Study Coordinator as listed on EDIC Form 101, Forms Mailing List, and EDIC Form 100, Clinic Forms Inventory.     A trace is initiated if there are any discrepancies, and the Study Coordinator is contacted so that copies of any missing forms may be mailed with the next month?s batch.     Data entry specialists then key the data using SAS programs.     There is a separate FSEDIT data entry program for each EDIC Form.     FoxPro Software is used to perform data entry and initial editing of the EDIC Genetics Studies data.     Keyed data is verified by the execution of another SAS program.     Keyed batch files are transferred from each data entry PC to the mainframe for further processing on a weekly basis.     EDIC Genetics Studies data is uploaded to the mainframe from each PC on a bi-weekly basis.

A SAS program is executed to produce a listing of keyed batches in preparation for the weekly production run.     The report lists the number of Forms in each batch, the date that the batch file was transmitted to the mainframe, and the date that the batch file was processed.     The production program is executed on a weekly basis.     This program adds keyed batch files for each EDIC Form to the corresponding Master File.     The DCC maintains a separate Master File for each EDIC Form.     SAS Software is used to convert the FoxPro data into a SAS database Master File for each Genetics Studies form, separately.

A separate edit program that searches for missing data, inconsistencies, and values out of range edits each form.     If any are found, an error notice (which lists all the errors detected for a given form) is generated and mailed to the originating Clinical Center for recording the correct information.     Corrected notices are returned to the Data Coordinating Center in the next month?s mailing.     A SAS FSEDIT program is used to key data received via EDIC Edit Message Reports.     Batches containing keyed EDIC Edit Message Report data are transferred from each PC hard-drive to the mainframe for further processing.     Another SAS program is run to add the Edit Message data to a transaction file.     Finally, another SAS program is executed to apply the edits to the appropriate Master File.     

The DCC generates clinical and feedback reports for each participant.     The purpose of the Patient Clinical Report/Feedback Report is to provide the patients and their physicians with the centrally determined results of his/her examination each year.     The EDIC Patient Clinical/Feedback Report that the patient receives includes exam results for all DCCT and EDIC years.     The report provides the following results for the examinations:       
HbA1c Measurement (%)
Glomerular Filtration Rate (Creatinine Clearance Lothalamate)
Serum Creatinine and Urine Albumin Excretion
Lipids (Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL, and LDL)
Retinopathy Level as measured with the ETDRS grading system
Visual Acuity (Snellen units)
Macular Edema Status
Intraocular Pressure (mmHg)
Ankle/Arm Doppler
ECG
Yearly gifts and holiday cards are also circulated from the DCC to the EDIC clinics to be distributed to the participants.

The DCC also generates reports for the clinics and various monitoring committees associated with the study.     These include:     a) one annual report for clinical centers; b) one quarterly report for clinical centers; c) nine reports for the Data Quality Assurance Subcommittee; d) eight quarterly reports for the Adherence Monitoring Subcommittee; e) six monthly reports for the Genetic Studies Subcommittee; f) 15 monthly reports for the CT Scan Subcommittee; and g) ten annual reports for the External Advisory Committee. A summary list of these reports and their content is attached to this document (see Attachment 6).     

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - The statistical staff of the DCC has extensive experience with the various types of data that are recorded and analyzed in studies of Type 1 diabetes, and with the statistical methods that are employed. In some cases, these are highly specialized. These include the analysis of ordinal longitudinal retinopathy data using multivariate rank tests, the analysis of coronary calcification measures with a lower limit of quantification using Tobit regression models, and the analysis of interval censored event time data, among others.
The Biostatistics Center has numerous software packages and products available to its statisticians and programmers (SAS and related SAS products, S-Plus, StatXact, LogXact, NQuery and various others) for use in conducting analyses and running periodic, ad hoc and interim study reports.     

WEBSITE MANAGEMENT The DCC maintains and updates the secured, password protected EDIC website where current versions of EDIC and EDIC Genetics forms, manuals of operations and protocols, and directories can be found.     Meeting materials and minutes, as well as information regarding EDIC and its ancillary studies can also be downloaded from this site.     Recently, the DCC has begun to incorporate interactive web forms that allow the clinical centers and central units to update certain EDIC Genetics Studies data remotely.     Future plans to accommodate evolving data management methods for the DCC includes moving towards a paperless, web-based data entry system where the clinics can conduct the yearly visits with patients and the data would be immediately available to the coordinating center.     

COLLABORATIONS One important function of the DCC is to facilitate scientific collaborations utilizing this unique cohort. Extensive knowledge of the DCCT/EDIC database allows the DCC to function as an investigative partner. Currently, the following institutions are collaborators with DCCT/EDIC Study Group on ongoing research projects: 

The Medical University of South Carolina is studying candidate genes for vascular disease complications in the DCCT/EDIC and determining associations of a detailed serum lipoprotein profile with microvascular disease status by performing a cross sectional study of subjects from DCCT/EDIC.     

The University of Washington's School of Medicine is evaluating specific common polymorphisms in candidate genes related to insulin resistance and central adiposity.     

The University of California, San Francisco is studying the natural history of Urologic complications in adults with Type 1 Diabetes.

The Joslin Diabetes Center and University of Pittsburgh are working jointly with the DCC in evaluating the effects of chronic hyperglycemia and episodic severe hypoglycemia on cognitive function.     

Finally, the University of Toronto is assessing familial aggregation of DNA variation in candidate genes within the cohort and their diabetic and non-diabetic family members in order to assess associations with diabetic complications.

The DCC staff is also making preparations for impending analyses utilizing the extensive DCCT/EDIC data, including:     retinopathy, visual acuity, albumin:creatinine ratio, carotid stenosis, urologic complications, obesity and overweight, cardiovascular and sub-clinical events, quality of life and SCL 90, dietary data, family clustering of diabetes, heart rate, and mortality.


The Data Coordinating Center contract was competitively awarded to The George Washington University on February 8, 1982 through March 7, 1987, and extended non-competitively three times through February 2007.Data analysis and reporting in DCCT/EDIC is ongoing. 

Determination to use other than full and open competition is made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (C)(1). See Note 22. Interested parties may submit.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL (NSWCPC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Shelton Mechanical Systems Inc, 236 Pine Ridge Drive, Panama City, Florida 32405 for the acquisition of technical support to perform an inspection on three (3) MCM or MHC OK-520 winch gear trains.  The purpose of the inspection is to determine how the High Speed gear trains with the Monel cone sets are enduring over time.  The AN/OK-520(V) Common Winch is the Deployment and Recovery (D/R) control mechanism for the AN/SQQ-32(V) Mine hunting Sonar Set (MSS). NSWCPC has a requirement to modernize the Fleets 1980s technology used in the MCM OK-520(V) Winch System to state-of-art 21st century technology, with integrated Smart Motor Controllers (SMCs), Programmable Logic Controllers (SMCs), and an interface to the Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS).  The purpose of the modernization effort is to minimize Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and increase the relia! bility of the winch itself.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Shelton Mechanical Systems Inc. has over 20 years experience regarding OK-520 Winch, winch and winch gear train operation, inspection procedures, gear diagnostic analysis, and tacit knowledge for proper remedy evaluation.  Additionally, it is paramount that the contractor has a functional and operational history base and understands the OK-520 Winch and Winch Gear Train systems extensively.  These prerequisites are mandatory to achieve all three inspections and both modernizations within the allotted time for shipyard availabilities and within budgetary constraints.  System requirements and historical nuisances have been developed over years and years of hands-on-experience working with the SQQ-32 and OK-520 systems.  In order to achieve these goals, NSWC PC requires that only experienced entities be utilized with extensive background, knowledge, hands-on experience of the SQQ-32 Sonar and OK! -520 Winch Systems and their interoperability.  Modernization and Gear Train Inspections will be schedule driven and NSWC PC will not have adequate time nor funds to train / teach non-experts about OK-520 winch and SQQ-32 sonar system operations or interactions. Award will be based on the written quotation. The anticipated award date will be on or about Dec 20, 2004.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity  Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 541330 applies. SBA Size Standard is $4.0M. FSC is B599.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), in Port Hueneme, CA 93043, manages the Energy-Savings Technology Validation (TechVal) program.  The purpose of this contract is to install and evaluate newer, commercially available, cutting edge energy saving technologies for the U.S. Navy.  The work associated with this contract is for the planning, design-and-development, installation or construction, commissioning, monitoring and operational and maintenance support for energy saving hardware, equipment, and systems specified by the Government.  The awarded contract shall provide operation and maintenance support for the hardware, equipment, and systems for the first year of performance after commissioning has been completed.

 It is anticipated that there will be a minimum of two (2) installations of six (6) different technologies per year for a minimum of twelve (12) total demonstration projects per year at twelve (12) separate facilities.   Simultaneous support at a minimum of four (4) separate sites involving four (4) different technologies is necessary

The scope of this contract will include the planning, design-and-development, construction or installation, commissioning, monitoring, operational-and-maintenance support, and removal-and-disposal of the following technologies, systems, hardware, and equipment:

-	Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, Direct Digital Controls (DDC) – facilities management systems, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Domestic Hot Water Heating Systems, Lighting Systems, Steam Condensate Systems, Boiler Plant Modifications, Weatherization (improving the thermal envelope of a building), Energy Recovery Systems, Electrical Energy Systems (increasing the energy efficiency of an electrical device or system or reducing cost by reducing peak demand), Renewable Energy Systems, Other Energy Consuming Systems utilized by the Navy, 
-	The Government may order demonstrations of other energy-savings technologies not cited here

The work involves determining the parameters to monitor for each technology to ensure that the equipment meets operational requirements and design a monitoring system that monitors those parameters.  This will include but not be limited to performance, energy savings and system availability.  

The work includes the ability to design and install a monitoring system for each installation.  The ability to perform detailed scientific monitoring and analysis of the installed technology in order to prove whether or not the installed technology does in fact save energy and does not have any other negative attributes such as increased maintenance or environmental considerations is tantamount to the success of subject work.  Prior experience with data collection, analysis, conclusion gathering and report writing is mandatory.

The monitoring system shall be designed such that risk of failure of any part of the monitoring system during the data acquisition period is minimal.  In order to eliminate the consequences of individual parts of the monitoring system failing, redundant parts may be required.  Commercial grade trending and control systems generally will not be acceptable.  The monitoring period may be up to one year in duration.  The monitoring system must have the capability to automatically download data from a remote location.  Monitoring may include baseline monitoring of the existing system.  The work will consist of initially analyzing the recorded data a minimum of once per day until it is verified the system is operating properly.  After the system is operating properly, a minimum of weekly monitoring during the monitoring period is necessary to ensure both the technology being monitored and the monitoring system continue to operate properly.  If any part of the monitoring system fails, the monitoring system shall be repaired (at no additional cost to the government) and operating within three days of detection of a failure.  Parameters to be monitored may include but not be limited to:

·	Electrical power, Electrical energy, Steam flow, Condensate flow,
      Cooling load, Temperatures, Flow rates, Humidity, Solar heat gain,
      Heat flux, Albedo, Electrical harmonics, Electrical power factor,
      Pressure, Differential pressure, RPM, Exhaust emissions

Final reports are required and shall include all monitored data along with helpful graphs, conclusions with data to back those conclusions, and a final evaluation of whether or not this technology meets the Navy operational requirements as far as performance, energy savings and system availability  

Installations will be on U.S. Navy sites, or at other U.S. Department of Defense Sites, located world-wide.  

This requirement is open nationwide.

<DESC>Requirement:  

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Alexandria, VA that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 98,735 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 89,324 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for ten years, with termination rights.    The space must be available for occupancy by January 1, 2005.
The delineated area is:
     North:  South Glebe Road
      East:  Interstate 395
     South:  Sanger Avenue
      West:  North Beauregard Street to Walter Reed Drive

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

•	Parking (9 on site, reserved spaces (inside vs. outside) for official Government vehicles)
•	Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, etc.)
•	Security Protection Bollards on the outside of the building

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

<DESC>The Department of State provides notice of an upcoming solicitation to procure support services for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Visa Office as a SDVOB set-aside.  A draft Statement of Work and draft Section B are available at www.statebuy.state.gov.  The solicitation is expected to be released on or about December 27, 2004.  At this time, the Department desires informal input from industry regarding a performance-based work environment.    We anticipate that it will be extremely difficult to implement metrics at the macro level because CA/VO management may request the contractor to change priorities or refocus effort on other areas.  The Department is considering structuring the contract as an "award term" contract where the contractor could earn additional years of work for good performance, however, input from SDVOB companies is desired in order to determine if this would provide sufficient motivation.    Please direct responses regarding performance based contracting via e-mail to Kathy Mejia at MejiaKJ@state.gov NLT 4:00 P.M. EST, December 15, 2004.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Nature of Amendment 08 and “02_RDD_CAPS_Schedule_08Dec2004_Amend08”:      a.    Nature of Amendment 08:              1)  CAPS A+AS Step02 document Library  “02 RDD Notional CAPS  Schedule” is renamed  “02 RDD CAPS Schedule” and has been revised.  The  posting/release of the Draft RFP has been delayed.  Currently anticipated  posting/release is 14 Feb 2005.  Additionally, until further notice, it will be  deleted from the CAPS A+AS Step02 document Library and appear as paragraph 2.b.  of each amendment.              2)  After release of the Draft RFP and until the release of the  Final RFP, i.e. 14 Feb 2005, communications in the forms of phone calls,  conference calls, one –on –one scheduled meetings will be entertained.   However, there is no plan for a second Business and Industry Day or a second  draft of the RFP.            3)  The following response is provide for “CAPS01 Document 24_CAPS- 21 Jun04_B-I_Day_Q-A_09Aug2004_Amend05, Questions # 7 and #38” conciening Joint  Ventures:             a)  Q # 7:  Joint Venture Strategy – What does this do for Small  Business?           b)  Q # 38:  If a group of small businesses form a joint venture to  pursue CAPS, is the size for comparison to the size standard the total of all  joint venturers, or if all meet the standard individually, will this be deemed  as meeting the size standard?         Response:  Two or more business entities can form a joint venture for  purposes of competing for  a government procurement.  If the two entities have  a formal mentor-protégé relationship one of them may be a large business.  The  mentor-protégé joint venture may compete as a small business so long as the  protégé qualifies as small under the applicable NAICS code.   The small  business must perform a significant portion of the work.  SBA must evaluate and  approve the joint venture on a case by case basis.  The joint venture also must  comply with SBA rules and reporting requirements designed to demonstrate an  expanding role for the small business involved in the joint venture.      b.  “02_RDD_CAPS_Schedule_08Dec2004_Amend08”:    Consolidated  Acquisition  of  Professional  Services  (CAPS) Schedule (As of 08 Dec 2004) 1.

Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (formerly STRICOM). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-D. Synthetic Environment Data Modeling, Interchange, Access, and Reuse Development Effort” Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Ms. Connie Perry, PEO STRI, (407)384-3920, Connie.Perry@peostri.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. 
PROBLEM: A solution to the miscorrelation and non-interoperability of Synthetic Environment (SE) databases across a confederacy of simulation vendors has long been a challenge that continues to elude the industry.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core’s goal is to resolve these correlation and interoperability issues or at least mitigate and manage the problem.  
CONCEPT OVERVIEW: The high-level concept is to develop the capability to generate rapid, correlated SE databases for a simulation confederacy using a common robust, fully attributed master database and a software architecture that  employs the use of COTS tools, common SE database generation processes and confederate specific software plug-ins via a public Application Programmers Interface (API).  Since the generation of the SE representation is common to all confederate plug-in applications, all exported confederate databases are insured of at least starting with a common representation of the SE.
OBJECTIVE: Soliciting innovation and ideas for the performance of research, development, design, and testing that directly supports advancement to the establishment of the Standard/Rapid Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC). The STDGC will incorporate automated processes to generate databases within 96 hours (with a goal of 72 hours or better) of receipt of properly attributed source data.  If properly attributed source data is not available then the STDGC will allow for the generation of compliant databases through user interaction.  For a more in-depth overview on the entire STDGC concept read the “Concept Paper for the Standard/Rapid Terrain Database Generation Capability in Support of the Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Initiative” located at http://www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/SECORE-STDGC.jsp. 
TECHNICAL PROOF OF CONCEPT AREAS FOR THE STDGC:
1.	Research, design and develop the capability to generate and verify a Master Database (MDB) of synthetic environment (SE) data.  This capability includes importing, via a user interface, common standard source data (including digital elevation data, cultural feature data, geo-typical and geo-specific imagery, weather data, CAD and simulation modeling formats, feature models, SEDRIS and emerging source formats). The import capability should convert from different coordinate systems and datums to a common geodetic coordinate system and encode all attribution that is required by other processes in the STDGC into a MDB.  The MDB data schema and organizational design for storing SE data shall be documented, including the utilization of multi-resolution and multi-representation versions of models and terrain (if any), an environmental data model (EDM) and a data representation model (DRM). Also, coordinate the integration of the Rapid Generation of Urban Terrain Databases STO into the STDGC.  Through automated processes the MDB shall be verified to contain the content and attribution required by a simulation confederacy.
2.	Research, design and develop the capability to edit and maintain the MDB.  Using COTS tools to the greatest extent possible, in a configuration managed environment, edit and maintain the MDB which includes, but is not limited to, intensification, filtering, creation of new or artificial data, correlation between different data sets and types.  An open, API to the MDB shall be developed and documented.  Documentation shall be provided of the hardware and software tool suite solution including, but not limited to, computers, data storage, plotters, printers, digitizers, network infrastructure, database preview capabilities and COTS tools.  As part of the STDGC documentation, the architecture of the MDB editing capability and relationships between the individual tools within the tool suite shall be described.  
3.	Research, design and develop a Runtime Database Generation Toolset (RDGT) capability.  It shall use the open API to the MDB to extract and then dynamically manipulate and generate SE data based on confederacy defined rules.  These rules shall be defined via a user interface and shall include, but is not limited to, defining feature interactions, content fidelity and acceptable geometric correlation error tolerances.  Using these rules, the RDGT shall include, but not be limited to, the capabilities of supporting multiple culture feature thinning methods, multiple terrain skinning methods, cultural feature to feature interactions, and cultural feature integration with terrain.  An open, plug-in based, API shall be developed to access this dynamically manipulated and generated SE data.  This architecture shall allow simulation vendors to write software plug-ins to the RDGT that will then format the data from the RDGT to the simulation systems vendors run-time database formats.  This API shall be capable of supporting the requirements of multiple simulation vendors and their data formatting requirements, creating correlated databases for disparate simulation systems using this common software process.  
4.	Research and design the hardware and software for the prototype database generation facility based on your solution for the STDGC, and then construct the prototype to test and demonstrate the end to end processes.  The design of the STDGC must take into consideration the support of an information assurance plan that is consistent with the prevailing DoD standards for sensitive and secret data sets. 
BACKGROUND:  The Army strives for more efficiency in the development and support of training and simulation systems.  To this end, several initiatives are underway within PEO STRI to develop common architectures and processes, utilizing the product-line approach.  These initiatives include the SE Core for virtual simulation, Army Constructive Training Federation (ACTF) for constructive simulations, and the Common Training Information Architecture (CTIA) for live training.  In concert, the Live, Virtual, Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) initiative is working to integrate the three domains to create a LVC training environment.   SE Core is the Army’s virtual component of the LVC-IA. 
SE Core will develop and integrate new and existing software and hardware products to create the Army’s Common Virtual Environment (CVE). The CVE will link system and non-system virtual simulations into a fully integrated training capability.  
A significant output of the SE Core components will be rapidly generated, correlated terrain databases generated by the STDGC process.  The SE Core program will develop automated terrain database processes, tool sets, and a master library of terrain data.  Additional terrain development efforts will leverage urban operations insets, dynamic terrain, atmospheric effects, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High Explosive (CBRNE), and visual models.  This will provide a common environmental representation enhancing interoperability while providing efficiencies.  
PROGRAM SCOPE:  A phased approach to this effort is sought. White Papers should address a basic award (Phase I) and 1 priced option (Phase II) as stated below.  This effort is expected not to exceed 16 months in length.  The anticipated funding for this effort is $1,500,000.00.  Each white paper shall include a statement that the offeror agrees to: 
a)	Government purpose rights applying to both technical data and software developed under this effort 
b)	the formal exchange of technical information with other SE Core Programs, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and/or Associated Contract Agreements (ASA), 
c)	participation in interchange meetings with other SE Core STDGC and Urban Terrain Database STO contractors.
PHASE I.  The Phase I effort will consist of research, development and design for the generation of a MDB from source data, the manipulation of data within the MDB, and correlation of disparate data sources within the MDB (paragraphs 1,2 and 3). The offeror shall deliver system design documentation in compliance with the DOD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) process for the open interface to the MDB and the overall design concept for the full end to end STDGC process.  Phase I shall include 1-2 formal technical interchange meetings to discuss the design of the MDB generation software suite and progress in the design of the RDGT and Synthetic Environment Exchange (SEE) API. There shall be a demonstration of the MDB generation software tools at the end of Phase I to assess the progress made toward the program goals in development of the offeror’s solution.  Through the offeror’s developed automated processes the MDB shall be verified as part of this demonstration to contain the content and attribution required by a simulation confederacy.  This effort is estimated at $500,000 over 6-8 months.
PHASE II.  In Phase II, the offeror will further evolve development efforts and shall implement and demonstrate a full end to end capability that generates a SEDRIS transmittal that will support the generation of correlated visual and OneSAF databases (paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4).  The offeror shall also deliver system design documentation of the RDGT rules implementation, the graphical user interface to the RDGT, the SEE API and recommendations for the hardware and software for the prototype database generation facility, that is documented in compliance with the DoDAF process   Also, the offeror shall analyze correlation errors inherent in the process of extracting source data, storing the data in the master database, extracting and thinning data, formatting the data through the RDGT plugins and run-time databases for LVC events.  There shall be 2-3 formal technical interchange meetings and the final demonstration of the full end to end process, the proof of concept of the RDGT, the plug-in API capability and the generation of multiple SEDRIS transmittals using various RDGT parameters.  This SEDRIS transmittal will be verified by the offeror’s proposed test plan to verify the generated SEDRIS output conforms to the confederacy defined rules and the known input given to the process.  This effort is estimated at $1,000,000 over 8-10 months.
Reference Documents are provided on the PEO STRI website at http://www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/SECORE-STDGC.jsp.  This announcement constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.

REQUIREMENTS:  Radar Functions: Counter-fire target acquisition of mortar fire, cannon and rocket targets. The O-LCMR shall have the ability to simultaneously search 360 degrees and perform hostile weapon location, observe and process friendly fire. The O-LCMR's primary mission is to detect, locate, and report enemy indirect fires. Its secondary mission is to provide accurate 'did hit' data of friendly fires and template/ record hostile locations. The O-LCMR shall have the ability to locate and classify threats according to target types, subtypes and have the capability of reporting back to the command and control node (Combat Net Radio). Target information shall also be stored for historical records. As a goal, the radar system shall be able to complete the basic elements  of transmitting, receiving, processing, and digital target reporting within 10 seconds (current MTP Standards) of weapon firing. Optimization of digital exchange with the Current and Future Combat System (FCS) shall be analyzed. Minimum and maximum ranges  should be 500 meters out to 10 km for artillery, mortars and cannons. The O-LCMR radar system will be capable of calculating launch point locations (LPLs) and friendly fire 'did hit data' within approximately a 25 meter or less Target Location Error (TLE)  at maximum range on mortars and 50 meters or less TLE at maximum range on cannon and rockets. In addition to the TLE requirement the system shall meet a Circular Error Probability requirement of 50%. System should have the capability of self-leveling to i ncrease accuracy. The antenna(s) for the O-LCMR shall be installed on the host platform and include a radome to protect system components from dust and the weather envi ronment. The O-LCMR shall able to operate with no performance degradation when co-located with operational Firefinder radars. During co-located operation, a common display of data from both radars is desired to facilitate ease of soldier operation and targ et location reporting.  The O-LCMR should be capable of digitally communicating its target location data via wireless to an operator with a laptop or hand-held, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) at a minimum distance of 1 km line-of-sight from the radar. It  is desired the O-LCMR have a capability to display situational awareness. The O-LCMR shall be able to be manipulated with the use of a laptop or PDA (active or standby mode, establish target priority sectors within the 360-degree coverage span, etc.) The O-LCMR shall be able to transmit 13-digit UTM target location coordinates with altitude digitally via a wireless and/or wired connection to an appropriate counter fire control authority (Mortar Ballistic Computer, Mortar Fire Control System, AFATDS, Future  Force Battle Command System or equivalent). Multiple O-LCMR systems shall be able to operate in a local area network to perform their functions simultaneously. The O-LCMR shall have an inter-platform communication subsystem to perform cueing of targets to  other nearby O-LCMRs.   Environmental Requirements: The O-LCMR system will be fielded to US Army personnel. Therefore, the O-LCMR shall operate in various environmental conditions Hot to +130 degrees Fahrenheit, Cold to -40 degrees Fahrenheit ('winterization' kit can be used for extreme cold weather operations). The O-LCMR shall be capable of withstanding the effects of salt spray, humidity, rain, salt fog, shock/vibration, dust, sand and fungi with full functionality. The O-LCMR shall have a 90 percent probability of operating fo r 72 continuous hours without an essential function failure in all environments. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components that can meet field test environments are encouraged but not mandatory. The O-LCMR will not contain radioactive materials, carcinoge nic or cancer suspect agents, or high toxic materials. Operating and maintaining the O-LCMR shall not cause unsafe conditions for the soldier. All hardware and software will be DII COE compliant. The O-LCMR shall have built-in low light level characteristi cs for night operations to facilitate light discipline.  The O-LCMR design architecture shall ensure a two level maintenance support concept which allows for modular/sub-component replacement of repairable and non-repairable parts in the field. The system design shall include a comprehensive built in test capability to ensure that the O-LCMR meets or exceeds a mean time to diagnose and repair at the operator level of 5 minutes and 30 minutes at the maintainer level. The O-LCMR shall not require preventive m aintenance higher than operator level. A tool kit and maintenance/cleaning kit will be provided. No special tools or test equipment shall be required. Maximum use of the Army inventory shall be made for any identified tools. Interactive Electronic Operator  and Technical Manuals (IETMS), on hard or compact disk) shall be provided to support operational and maintenance and training concepts. Embedded Training capabilities are required to support both institutional and sustainment training at national training  centers (HLA or DIS may be required). Unit training shall be able to be conducted by unit commanders in accordance with Army Readiness Training Evaluation Plan (ARTEP), Mission Training Plans (MTP), the IETMS, Soldiers Manual, and the Battalion Training M anagement System (BTMS). IETMS shall be tailored to ensure that periodic organizational, and depot-level maintenance functions can be cost effectively performed.

<DESC>Modification of the Sources Sought Notice / Request for Information (RFI) posted to FedBizOps on 23 November 2004.  Additional information is provided based upon similar, multiple questions raised by a number of interested vendors.  1) The Government owns the programming language of the existing MODS platform, so that if this requirement were competed - the new Contractor could pick-up where ASM Research Incorporated has left off, or use those parts of the program that best fit their  proposed next-generation business solution.    2)  It is true that ASM Research Inc. has rights to the intellectual knowledge gained in the development of this system and thereby ASM is free to employ that knowledge for other Government agencies.  Given all present conditions now and in the foreseea ble future, MODS will continue to be maintained as the current operational system and MODS will be improved upon until a next-generation system is developed that supercedes it.  In the current operating environment, it is not foreseen that this next-genera tion system event will occur within the next 10 years.  ASM Reseach Inc. could attempt to create a new tri-service or even Army wide solution to replace MODS, but the big caveat is that the funding is not present nor is the interest out there at this time for such a next-generation leap above and beyond continuous improvements upon the current MODS platform. 3) The following programming languages are currently utilized under the MODS platform.  This is not necessarily an all-inclusive listing of all programming languages.  The MODS programming is performed in COBOL for mainframe and web, PROD, DB2MAINT, DB2PRP T, DB2PICS, DEGAUSS, and WRBU.  The data types, not necessarily an all-inclusive listing, includes Char, Float, Varchar, Nvarchar, Datetime, Int, and Text. 4) The MODS data resides on a server farm that transfers data seamlessly, such that if one server is down the entire load can be shifted without loosing the whole system.  Some servers owned and managed by Dencom and others by the Pentagon. The closing date for receipt of all RFI responses is hereby extended to Close of Business on 3 January 2005.  All other information and questions posed within the original RFI notice remains unchanged.

Requirements: The Air Force requires advanced technologies that facilitate the conduct of contingency base operations, combat support functions, and force protection in both homeland security and Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) operations.  In addition, provide opportunities for reduction of weight, volume, and costs of base emergency response, infrastructure support, and combat support systems.  

AFRL/MLQ solicits cutting edge proposals in the following general technology areas:  

Atmospheric Threat Protection - Identify characteristic emissions or patterns that enable detection, identification, and/or modeling of anthropogenic chemicals in or transported through the atmosphere.  Develop and/or evaluate methods or technologies enabling localization and/or identification of these emission sources, for example storage, use, or accidental/deliberate release of toxic chemicals.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from atmospheric threats, either inside or adjacent to forward operating bases, and that may contribute to reducing or eliminating threats to personnel and equipment.  

Protective Technologies - Develop chemical processes and passive or self-decontaminating materials that will reduce recovery time and provide a significant improvement in decontamination capabilities.  Develop sensing, active and passive protection, and decontamination technologies for improved force protection at fixed and forward bare airbases.  Develop systems for detecting and quantifying toxic materials or hazards (chemical, biological, radiological, and energetic).  Provide technology for automated hazard warning/avoidance, neutralization or decontamination, and decontamination validation in operational areas and industrial sites.  Develop technologies to technician operable/maintainable, affordable, deployable and modular, allowing rapid mobilization and demobilization.  Hazard avoidance during operations will allow sustained operations tempo; assurance of effective decontamination of equipment and operational areas; and ability to continue operations in “shirtsleeve” environment.  

Explosive Effects Mitigation – Identify explosive characteristic effects or patterns that enable detection, evaluation, and/or modeling of the explosive and resulting effects.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate protective technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from blast, ballistic, and fragmentation effects.  Develop new materials, technologies, and/or methodologies to mitigate blast effects resulting in reduced injuries and deaths to building/shelter occupants.  

Shelters – Develop new and advanced shelters that are lightweight and low volume, easy to erect, and requires low maintenance.  The new shelter will be used for housing personnel and aircraft maintenance and storage for long term and under harsh environments.  Specific areas of interest include: airbeam technology based on lightweight and high strength fibers integrated solar power and corporation of chem/bio and directed energy protection into shelter.  

Air Base Operating Surfaces  - Develop lightweight portable airfield evaluation technologies for surface and subsurface material characterization, expedient repair materials and techniques, lightweight high-strength materials, and measurement and prediction in response to traffic and environmental loads.  

Protection of Deployed Forces and Assets  - Develop lightweight rapidly deployable personnel and aircraft shelters, and protection systems for facilities and aircraft parking areas.  Specific areas of interest include ultra-lightweight, high-strength materials, exploitation of in situ materials, and post-construction reinforcement of facilities, simulation and modeling of effects of air-blast and fragmentation, and chemical/biological protection systems.  

Combat Utility Systems – Develop new energy and utility systems technologies that increase mobility, reliability, and efficiency on all deployable utilities required for AEF operations.  Specific areas of interest include: fuel reforming to produce hydrogen, fermentative and photosynthetic production of hydrogen from deployed base waste streams, active and passive power generation, power conditioning and distribution systems, environmental control units, and solid/liquid deployable waste management systems.  

Robotics/Explosive Ordnance Disposal – Develop automation technologies for use in high threat areas for AEF and related uses. The specific areas of interest include new technology for: explosive ordnance and mine detection, characterization, and disposal, including buried, surface and underwater ordnance; ground vehicle navigation and guidance; sensing systems; robotic vehicle systems, including teleoperation and automation technology; site survey vehicles; and related automated construction technologies.  

Fire Fighting - Develop agents, systems, equipment and hardware for use in aircraft firefighting and rescue operations, airbase structural firefighting, weapons systems firefighting, hazardous materials incidents, and improved firefighter training.  Develop DoD firefighting systems such as munitions protection and explosion mitigation.  Specific areas of interest include the development of environmentally compatible, operationally and cost effective fire extinguishing agents, aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles/systems, fire detection/suppression systems, specialized rescue and personnel protective equipment, and training technologies.  The objective is to enhance airbase and other DoD firefighting safety programs and training capabilities that significantly reduce the amount of time to extinguish fires, extract victims, and minimize damage/casualties.  

Biocatalytic Materials Synthesis – High-performance space and aerospace materials are often produced by complex sequences of reactions involving toxic solvents and expensive catalysts.  Some materials are derived from structures that are difficult to make via traditional synthetic chemical techniques.  Successful development of green chemistry approaches to materials synthesis would not only reduce the cost of the material, but also eliminate negative environmental impacts.  One successful approach for synthesis of industrial, pharmaceutical, and agricultural chemicals involves biocatalysis – the use of living cells or enzymes as catalysts for chemical reactions.  Biocatalysis may yield novel materials or better synthetic pathways to known materials by allowing targeted production of specific structures under mild conditions required to support biological processes.

Proposal Preparation: Responses submitted shall include a proposal for technical and cost/price as follows:

Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will compete for contract award based upon their potential value to the government in fulfilling the requirements set forth above. That value will be determined using a complex combination of criteria including the technical promise (originality, feasibility, desirability, etc.), affordability (of development, considering technical alternatives and funding available, and of implementation if otherwise successful), and the government's confidence in the effective pursuit of the effort considering the scope of the effort, the offeror's understanding of it, the competence and availability of experienced engineering, scientific, managerial, or other technical personnel, offeror's overall corporate experience (including past performance), and the availability of, or ability to obtain, necessary facilities to perform this effort. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, a part thereof or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Technical consideration will be given greater weight than cost in the selection decision. No further evaluation criteria will be used in source selection. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.

Firms responding should indicate whether or not they are a small business, small disadvantaged business, or a woman-owned business. Award Information: Multiple awards are anticipated. While no parts of this requirement lend themselves to being severed for set-aside to Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, or historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), the Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto. 

Preferred Type of Contract: Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF). Period of Performance: Maximum duration up to twenty-four (24) months. 

Security Requirements: Analysis capability, to include personnel and computer facilities cleared to Secret level, may be required. In such instances responding firms must have, or acquire prior to award of contract, appropriate security clearances.

<CONTACT>Mitzi Wall, 410-278-0868
<DESC>US Army Project Manager Soldier Equipment is conducting a market survey to identify manufacturers that have a commercially available, non-developmental integrated protective ensemble system to protect exposed Soldiers operating crew served weapons fr om a ring mount, cupola, or pedestal mount in military vehicles. The protective system, in conjunction with current US Army force protection equipment, must provide face, neck, head, and upper and lower extremity protection from the blast overpressure, fra gmentation, impact, and flash heat associated with the detonation of improvised explosive devices (IED), rocket propelled grenades, and other indirect fire weapons such as mortars and artillery. The primary purpose of this system is to enable an exposed So ldier to survive an IED ambush and continue to provide suppressive fires after the blast event. The system must not degrade the Soldiers ability to detect targets and perform tasks associated with operation of crew served weapons, and must make provisions  for comfort from excessive heat. The integrated system must be interoperable with the US Army Advanced Combat Helmet and the US Army Interceptor Body Armor system consisting of an Outer Tactical Vest and two Small Arms Protective Inserts.   Specifications: 1.  Threat.  The desired system must protect Soldiers from four types of blast related threats associated with IED and RPG: a. Primary Blast Injury: injuries produced by high peak overpressures of short duration associated with the blast wave of the IED.  b. Secondary Blast Injury: injuries produced by fragmentation, missiles, and spall associated with the detonation of the IED.   c. Tertiary Blast Injury: injuries produced by the impact resulting from the action of the blast wave on the Soldier. The overpressure wave may cause the mounted Soldier to be hurled against hard objects or thrown from a vehicle resulting in impact with th e ground or other objects.  d. Fourth Degree Blast Injury: burns and injury caused by the flash heat associated with the detonation of the IED.   2. Blast Protection  protect the soldier from primary blast injury from a detonation of 10 kg C4 at a 3 meter standoff. 3. Fragmentation/Ballistic Protection  provide ballistic/fragmentation protection for the upper and lower extremities equivalent to or better than the Interceptor Outer Tactical Vest. Ballistic face shield ballistic requirement is for a V50 of 450 meters/ second or better when tested with 17 grain fragment simulating projectile. 4.  Weight  the total system weight borne by the Soldier, not including the weight of Interceptor Body Armor and Advanced Combat Helmet, must be less than 25 pounds. 5. Visibility  the blast and ballistic resistant face and neck system must provide for full field of vision and optical clarity. An anti-fogging feature is desired.   6. Mobility - the system must be able to be donned in 90 seconds and doffed in less than 10 seconds by a Soldier wearing Interceptor Body Armor and Advanced Combat Helmet. The system must not significantly degrade the mobility of the gunner to engage enemy  forces and quickly load/reload weapons. 7. Cooling  the system must have a provision for cooling the Soldier for a duration of 2 to 4 hours while system is worn during convoy escort operations. Operation of cooling system from vehicle power is desired. The system must provide 100 watts or bette r of cooling per Soldier in a desert environment with temperatures to 130 degrees F. 8. Sizing  the system must be interoperable with all sizes of Interceptor Body Armor and Advanced Combat Helmet.  9. Environmental  the Soldier-borne components of the system must be water resistant, flame resistant, and durable to withstand extended wear in a desert environment with temperatures to 130 degrees F. 10. Test/Evaluation Process  the protective system will undergo ballistic, blast and fragmentation testing at an NIJ certified Laboratory and government test facility.  Product Manager Soldier Equipment requests that interested manufacturers having a non-developmental, commercially available solution meeting the above requirements submit for evaluation one complete sample product, with technical specification, performance  data, cost per unit, and production capability. Submit to the following address NO LATER THAN 23 Dec 04. Questions shall be directed to Karl Masters or Chris Perritt, (703)704-0068 or (703)704-0181 respectively.

<SUBJECT>99 -- CNRSE FACILIITIES SUPPORT CONTRACTS (FSC) GOVERNMENT/INDUSTRY FORUM
<DESC>Commander Navy Region South East (CNRSE) is hosting the second CNRSE Facilities Support Contracts (FSC) Government/Industry Forum on 5 January 2004 at the BOQ Conference Room, Building 11 Mustin Road, Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida 32212.  All current CNRSE FSC service providers are invited.  CNRSE has Navy activities in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina.

It is anticipated that approximately 40 to 50 participants from government and industry will attend.  The forum will be a one-day event that will include the full spectrum of CNRSE FSC service providers as well as key government representatives in the FSC program and acquisition functions.  Information and ideas of interest to this group will be shared with the continued intent of improving the general understanding of the 1) changing resource environment, 2) processes and approaches that may be used to balance resources with requirements and, 3) related issues and concerns from the government and contractor perspective.  These three themes continue to be be central to the government/industry exchange at the forum.  However, new issues that may affect FSC contracts will also be discussed as appropriate.  Discussion of specific contract actions or procurements in progress will be limited, as needed, to appropriately preserve procurement integrity and business sensitive information.  Otherwise, we welcome an open exchange and we are very interested in having you participate and share your views.  To receive a Forum Invitation and register to attend contact the Forum Coordinator Crystal D. Life, 02CL, at (904) 542-8745 X 1120, fax (904) 542-8710 or email:  crystal.life@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>58 -- MODE LOCKED TI: SAPPHIRE LASER
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Coherent Laser Group to purchase a mode locked ti:sapphire laser. The current laser system is composed of 3 parts, a pump laser, a mode locked ti:sapphire laser, and an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). A single vendor of all three parts is required to ensure compatibility. To meet our needs, the output of the ti:sapphire laser must meet the following specifications:
Autocorrelation:	Greater than 200 fs, but less than 100 fs
	Average power:	Less than 650 mW (using 5 watt solid state 532 nm pump source)
	Tuning range:	700-980nm with a single optics set
	RMS noise:		Greater than 0.1% (10Hz-20MHz)
	Polarization:		Horizontal
	Repetition Rate:	76 MHz
1) 	System must be completely compatible and characterized with the Coherent Verdi pump laser and Mira-OPO synchronously-pumped optical parametric oscillator.
2) 	The laser must be passively mode locked and use a variable saturable absorber or slit for preferential control between CW and mode locked operation. This configuration provides a means for controlling loss differential as well as gain differential which is necessary for reliable operation and control of the spectral purity of the mode locked output. The system must not use active electronic modulation such as AO modulators. Our measurements would be completely compromised if CW breakthrough components were present in the mode locked pulse spectrum, and would make many of our experiments impossible. It is therefore imperative that the system must include a mechanism for directly controlling differential loss in the laser cavity. Completely eliminating CW breakthrough can only be accomplished by controlling not only differential gain but also differential loss in the system.  Controlling loss differential eliminates the need for us to make adjustments to pump power, mode quality, and cavity alignment that cannot completely remove CW breakthrough as required over the duration of the experiments.
3) 	The laser must use a birefringent filter wavelength-tuning element. Moving slit tuning elements are unacceptable because of their wavelength drift.
4) 	The system must have a starter mechanism that reproducibly initiates mode-locked operation and shuts off automatically one the mode-locking has started.
5) 	Variable group velocity dispersion compensation must be provided with a simple 2-prism configuration within the laser cavity.  Four-prism configurations are unacceptable because of possible beam motion.
6) 	To simplify optical alignment, the laser must have a horizontal, two-dimensional optical path.
7) 	The system must have internal pump laser steering optics mounted to the laser base plate for maximum stability and control of the pump beam position into the ti:sapphire crystal. These mounts must provide independent translational and rotational positioning of the pump beam.
8) 	The laser must be able to be pumped from the side so that no turning mirror is required outside the laser to direct the pump beam into the cavity. This configuration allows the laser to be positioned as the corner of the optical table for convenient integration with our experiments.
9) 	The system must include a complete integrated diagnostics system with the following: a) an integral scanning interferometer to detect any CW spectral features which are displayed on the control unit to warn the user of this unwanted component in the mode locked pulse train,  b) an integral power meter/fluorescence detector that has a five decade auto ranging circuit is used to align the laser when changing optics or switching modes of operation,  c) an integral humidity detector to monitor purging effectiveness when tuning in wavelength ranges that are susceptible to absorption by water vapor.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Based on our market research, Coherent Laser Group is the only vendor who can meet the requirements of this procurement.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm.

<SUBJECT>75 -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>BACKGROUND
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Division for Human Resources Products and Services, Center for Retirement and Insurance Service, Retirement Services Program, mails Retirement Services Reference cards to new retirees, survivors of retirees, and retirees requesting a replacement card.  The card identifies the individual’s name, retirement claim number, and the back of the card has OPM internet and telephone contact information.  
SUMMARY
OPM intends to issue a sole-source, firm-fixed price purchase order to Xerox Corporation to purchase 100,000 Retirement Services Reference Cards in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
This requirement will be awarded to a large business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 333313.  A market research was conducted and there were not two or more small businesses that could fulfill this requirement. 
DESCRIPTION
The Contractor is required to provide 100,000 Retirement Services Reference Cards in accordance with the following specifications:  Document Specifications:  8.5” x 11”, 28 lb. white paper; pressure seal “C” fold format; 2 sets of horizontal, fold-assist perforations along 8.5” dimension (perfs are 1/16” x 1/16”); 2 sets of vertical tear-off perforations along 11” dimension (perfs are 1/32” x 1/32”); Prints 4-color process plus black. Card Specifications:  2-1/8” x 3-3/8”, .007” white; heat, tear, and water-resistant; prints 4-color process plus black.  These cards are to be used with the Xerox 4635 Printer and Moore LaserMate LM-20 Pressure Seal Mailing System.  
DELIVERABLES
100,000 Retirement Services Reference Cards made in accordance with the specifications above are to be delivered by February 1, 2005 to the Alexandria Distribution Center, 929 S. Pickett Street, Alexandria, VA 22304, Attn:  Dave Funsten, CON 158983, RI 20-2, 10/2003 edition.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:
We have tried other products by other manufacturers which caused major delays and incurred significant costs. It is imperative that these cards are distributed in a timely manner.  Delays and malfunctions will be detrimental with the deliverance of these cards to annuitants.  We have encountered significant problems caused by substandard paper produced by other manufacturers in the past.  We have met with other manufacturers about procuring an improved product.  It was suggested that we procure a credit card-like product which would have been costly and forced us to purchase new in-house printing equipment.  Contracting out because of equipment issues would have increased the final cost significantly.     

The Xerox Corporation has an existing product that meets our specifications – the DocuCard.  This product meets our budget requirements and can be used with our existing Xerox and Moore equipment.  
 
Interested parties are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Therefore, items that are confidential to businesses, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked.  Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when OPM or the Government determines disclosure when they are warranted by FOIA.  However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.  

This in no way obligates the Government to award a sole-source BPA. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are invited to submit a statement of capability with pricing information, within 15 days of publication of this notice.  The Government will not pay for information provided.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  Interested parties are requested to contact Toni Campbell at Antoinette.Campbell@opm.gov or by fax at (202) 606-1464.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

BACKGROUND

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  NARA is an independent Federal agency that helps preserve our nation's history by overseeing the management of all Federal records. Our mission is to ensure ready access to the essential evidence that documents the rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. We must make it easy for citizens to access this essential evidence regardless of the location of the documentation or of the people using it. 

In accordance with 44 USC 2108, the Archivist [of the United States] is responsible for the
“custody, use, and withdrawal of records transferred to him.”   44 USC 2109 authorizes the Archivist to “provide for the preservation, arrangement, .description, and exhibition of records....”  

Museum Programs (NWE).  The Museum Programs staff administers NARA’s exhibition programs, educational programs, and volunteer services.  It is responsible for developing systematically designing programs for various audiences that communicate NARA’s mission, develop an appreciation of NARA goals, and foster an understanding of the national experience.   Audiences served by Public Programs include the general public, educators and students, the researcher community, the Federal government, and the archival community.  

Each year, approximately one million visitors come to the Rotunda to view the Charters of Freedom and other changing exhibits.  Millions more visit the Online Exhibit Hall and The Digital Classroom each year.  Thousands of educators attend document- based workshops or use document-based publications in their classrooms, while NARA’s docents provide thousands more with behind-the-scenes tours and document workshops for community and school groups.  NARA’s archival holdings are also featured in public lectures, conferences, film series, performances, and special events attended by a wide variety of constituents throughout the year.  

Exhibits Staff (NWE-X).  The Exhibits staff creates and maintains the major exhibitions in the Rotunda and the Special Exhibitions Gallery of the National Archives Building in Washington, DC and at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland; develops traveling exhibits, facsimiles exhibits, and online exhibits (see www.archives.gov); and coordinates the loan of original documents for exhibition outside of the agency.  In addition to these duties, the exhibits staff assists other NARA units with the creation of permanent and traveling exhibits. 

Exhibition Spaces at the National Archives:   NARA exhibits original documents and artifacts from its holdings and from non-NARA sources at the National Archives Building in Washington, DC and its presidential libraries (Hoover through Clinton, except Nixon). 

National Archives Building.   Original documents and artifacts are displayed in the Rotunda, Special Exhibition Gallery, and East and West Rotunda Galleries.  Security guards are stationed in gallery spaces during public hours and patrol these space during non-public hours.  The galleries are also protected with electronic surveillance systems.   The building is equipped with a sophisticated climate control system for maintaining appropriate temperature and relative humidity and filtering pollutants from the air. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt Library.  Original documents are displayed in both permanent and changing exhibits galleries.   Security guards are stationed in gallery spaces during public hours and patrol these space during non-public hours.  The galleries are also protected with electronic surveillance systems.   The building is equipped with a sophisticated climate control system for maintaining appropriate temperature and relative humidity and filtering pollutants from the air. 

Storage Areas at the National Archives.    NARA stores original documents and artifacts from its holdings and non-NARA sources at the National Archives Building, the National Archives at College Park, and its presidential libraries (Hoover through Clinton, including Nixon).   All storage areas are protected with appropriate security and climate control systems.

C.1  Background.C.1.1 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC)licenses and inspects nuclear reactors, materials, and waste facilities to ensure compliance with applicable codes and standards during all phases of construction, testing, and decommissioning operation to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the effects of radiation. In furtherance of its mission, over the past 25 years, the NRC has conducted a variety of OD interventions for its managers, supervisors, and staff designed to strengthen the participants’ effectiveness and efficiency in their current positions and to develop their skills and knowledge for future work activities. These interventions have included coaching for specific projects, such as the licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository, crisis and risk communications, and conducting organizational development (OD) to improve group and individual performance. In Fiscal Year 2003, approximately 30 coaching and OD sessions were conducted. The NRC anticipates that requests for such services will continue during the next five years. C.2 Objective. C.2.1 The NRC seeks to obtain a five year contract (Base Year and four option years) to enhance the skills and knowledge of its employees (nonsupervisory, supervisory, and managerial) in all grades, including Senior Executive Service members, by offering organizational development consulting services, on an as needed basis, upon request by an NRC office.  C.2.2 The objective of this contract is to: Sustain a high performing workforce; Maintain and enhance the professionalism of its employees; Build public confidence and trust in the NRC; Enable the professional staff to meet new challenges confronting them in their positions; Prepare employees for management and supervisory responsibilities; Improve individual and group performance and address cultural and environmental issues through role modeling during presentation of OD interventions; and Provide state-of-the-art OD services at a reasonable cost. C.3  Scope of work. The contractor shall provide the OD services outlined in the SOW at NRC Headquarters and its regional offices, as requested by the PM. However, it is not anticipated that any one of NRC’s regions will require more than three visits in any fiscal year over the life of the contract. Should more than three (3) sessions in the regions be required, the number of sessions will be increased in accordance with the Changes Clause. Specifically, the contractor shall be responsible for performing the following activities: a. Developing individual participant materials necessary for conducting a topic specific OD/coaching session; b. Coaching staff and management on communication topics to prepare them for interactions with the public, media, Congress, and other stakeholders; c. Reviewing previously developed OD materials (i.e., slides, tapes, or other NRC-provided documents), and making recommendations for their improvement; d. Enhancing communication skills internally through OD interventions; and e. Facilitating OD sessions (to include using any instruments such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or 360 Degree Surveys) to add insights for performance improvement. C.3.1 Organizational Development Interventions. The NRC provides OD interventions covering a variety of situations to supervisors, managers, and executives, who request such services. These services include, but are not limited to: custom designed activities related to team building; conducting employee surveys and providing feedback on the results of those surveys; small group and individual improvement processes; organizational culture and environment; process re-engineering, diagnostics;  conflict resolution and techniques for solving conflict; executive coaching; information gathering relating to performance issues; communications coaching; and administering/interpreting MBTI or 360 Degree Surveys. The focus of OD interventions at NRC is the maintenance of the individual and of the NRC’s organizational health and effectiveness.  A. The following systems define various approaches the NRC has used to provide OD: 1. Whole system. May include an office, a division, a branch, or a combination of other work units. 2. Goal oriented. Intended to improve present or future organization effectiveness. 3. System approach. This is a systematic, planned, long-range approach to change, emphasizing a lasting change. This approach attempts to influence the culture and norms by changing values, attitudes, knowledge, behavior, processes, and structures. 4. Change intervention. Gains top management’s and any other person or
group’s commitment and involvement in order to influence a favorable outcome of the change. 5. Collaborative effort.  Includes those affected by the process and recognize the importance of involvement in developing commitment. 6.  Behavioral approach. Draws from the fields of organizational behavior, management, public administration, psychology, sociology, anthropology, education, and counseling. 7. Data-based. Uses real-life data of the organization requesting the intervention for analysis, problem solving, and motivating change, rather than making assumptions about issues. 8.  Education-based. Develops attitude and recommends practices for managers to have a more effective organization that rewards individual and group behavior leading to effectiveness and efficiency. 9. Guided. Focuses primarily on organizational and group change and secondarily on individual change. 10. Process and structures. Works with individuals and groups, and the organization as a whole, for improvements in an organization’s processes and structures. This aspect requires great skill.  10.  Follow-up. Planned follow-up. This is a necessary component to maintain the desired change. B. The OD required by this SOW is defined as follows: 1. Facilitating focus group feedback, improving communications (including listening skills), facilitating at retreats and meetings, gathering data for analysis to gain insight pertaining to the OD intervention to be used, and providing any training and requisite tools or instruments, such as the MBTI or the 360 Degree Survey that may be associated with a particular OD intervention. 2. Design interventions, such as risk communications, team building, and coaching for groups on nuclear related issues, and address other NRC-specific issues. C. As in instructional system design (ISD) course development and training, OD programs have a number of important stages. The following six stages are critical to OD for best results and should be adhered to: Stage 1. A preliminary need’s assessment is required for OD program design, negotiation, and commitment building. Stage 2. Diagnosis of the organization is required to determine organizational strengths, weaknesses, and needs. This is one of the most important stages of the process because it brings issues to the surface and starts the organization on the road to change.) Stage 3. To plan for change, OD intervention techniques are used to make improvements and needed changes in the organization. Several activities are included in this stage, such as: program design, problem solving, training, team building, intergroup team building, intragroup team building, and strategic planning. Stage 4. The stabilization stage is necessary for reinforcing, maintaining, and normalizing the values, skills, and changes learned in the OD intervention.  Stage 5. The evaluation stage is also necessary to OD interventions and must not be skipped. This stage may include the following: Making another diagnosis and comparing the result with the original diagnosis; Asking key employees for verbal or written comments on the value of the intervention; Looking at changes in performance and other important aspects, when appropriate, to assess the overall effectiveness of the intervention to encourage members of an organization to improve or maintain their performance; Stage 6. The follow-up evaluation plan is used by top management, the internal NRC person charged with implementing the plan, and the change agent (the OD facilitator) to learn more about the value of the intervention.  D. OD interventions are generally scheduled according to internal
need and frequently on short notice. OD interventions require contractor flexibility, a high degree of coordination to provide the service requested, and a close working relationship with the PO, Contracting Officer (CO), and the NRC requesting office. Occasionally, two facilitators may be required for an OD program. The second (junior) facilitator shall be less qualified and paid at a lesser rate than the lead (senior) OD facilitator. A second facilitator shall not be added to the activity without prior approval from the CO, nor shall extra time be added to an established length of time without prior approval of the CO.  C.3.2 Personnel Qualifications. The contractor shall provide qualified OD facilitators to conduct customized OD, such as team building; coaching in preparation for public meetings; reviewing and coaching on specific topics to be presented at a public meeting; quality management techniques; organizational and individual performance improvement; small group improvement processes; organizational culture and environmental issues; special learning groups; focus group feedback sessions; communications to include listening skills, facilitation at management retreats and meetings, and gathering data and analyzing it to gain insight pertaining to an OD intervention.  The facilitators shall be able to provide any training necessary that is associated with these activities. Proposed OD facilitators shall have a minimum of five years of experience providing similar OD interventions to other Federal Government agencies of a scientific and engineering nature. At a minimum, OD facilitators shall have the following skills: a. Knowledge. The proposed OD facilitator shall possess knowledge of OD, the behavioral sciences, management, general business, training, and current developments in OD. b. Conceptual. The proposed OD facilitator shall be skilled in the theory for understanding organizations and the process of change; a view of organizations; and an ability to visualize, design, and implement long-range training programs or other appropriate interventions.  c.  Humanistic. The proposed OD facilitator shall possess strong interpersonal skills in the following areas: communications, providing and receiving feedback, leveling and confronting, and the ability to handle stress and frustration. d. OD Affiliations. The proposed OD facilitators shall identify any affiliations they
have or have had with applicable professional OD organizations, such as the Organizational Development Network. They shall be certified in organizational learning, coaching, creative leadership, and qualified to administer and interpret the MBTI and the 360 Degree Survey instruments. C.3.3 Organizational Development Session Administration.  A.  The OD facilitator/ instructor shall make their needs for audio-video equipment known to the NRC Project Manager (PM) in advance of the OD session, so that such equipment will be in place when the facilitator arrives. B. The contractor shall reproduce and deliver a participant handbook for each participant in the OD intervention, where applicable. C. The OD facilitator shall arrive in sufficient time to ensure that the equipment and room setup is satisfactory and to distribute any coaching materials and handouts required for a particular coaching session prior to the official start time of the coaching session. D. The facilitator shall commence the OD session by describing the importance of providing the OD session, providing the objectives and outcomes for the session. E. The training room used shall be left in a neat and clean condition.  Upon completion of each OD session, the facilitator shall remove all extraneous  materials, including used flip chart sheets, extra handout materials, etc., that were used during the presentation of the OD session. F. The NRC may require that crisis and risk communication coaching be conducted by two-way televideo conferencing, so that participants located in the NRC regional offices may participate in the coaching session that is being held at NRC Headquarters. NOTE: While the contractor will not need to be technically knowledgeable about the NRC’s televideo equipment, the contractor shall be able to provide facilitators who will have experience adjusting their presentation style to include those virtually participating on a large monitor in the classroom. C.3.4 Participant Evaluation.  The NRC will provide a sample of an evaluation/feedback form (Attachment 1) that the contractor shall duplicate and distribute to each participant to complete. The NRC reserves the right to make changes to the evaluation form as necessary to meet its reporting requirements. The original copy of all completed participant evaluations shall be submitted to the NRC Project Officer (PO) on the day the course ends. The contractor shall summarize the findings on each evaluation form in the monthly report and provide the summary to the NRC PO no later than10 days after completion of the course. C.3.5 Quality of Performance.  During the life of the contract, the contractor shall assure that the OD facilitators and  OD materials are of the highest quality. The contractor shall, as a minimum: 1. Provide a qualified primary instructor that is capable of conducting an OD session with an estimated 12 to 30 participants and one alternate back-up facilitator for each OD session. The Alternate shall be capable to fill-in if the primary instructor is unable to perform the services on the date scheduled. The contractor shall obtain the PM’s approval before substituting a primary or a back-up OD facilitator in accordance with the Key Personnel Clause of this contract. 2. Be responsible for reading and understanding the materials and make recommendations to improve slides provided by NRC staff in the OD/coaching sessions and ensure that participant materials are designed and printed in a quality fashion, as outlined in this SOW, and acceptable to the PM. 3. Maintain control of the learning time so that the presentation of information and exercises are organized and timely (key points and course objectives are stated and met.) 4. Provide 10 minute breaks (generally every 50 minutes) within the overall schedule, and manage distractions. Consistently and tactfully defer questions of minimal interest to the group, to answer a later time, in an effort to save time. 5. Observe the effect of the coaching on the group and reasonably attempt to clarify, provide examples or, in some other way, help correct problems, and improve participants’ opportunity to learn. C.3.6 Program Management. The contractor shall be responsible for managing and coordinating the delivery of all services described in this SOW.  The contractor shall provide a full-time Program Manager (PM), available Monday through Friday, except for Federal holidays, during normal business hours (eg, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time), for implementing tasks pertaining to the contract and responding to all NRC OD requests effectively and efficiently in a timely manner. This shall include answering questions about invoicing, scheduling, delivery of course materials, availability of OD facilitators, and other related contractual matters. The PM shall perform the following tasks, at a minimum: 1. Ensure completion and timely delivery of required contract reports.  2.  Communicate, as appropriate, via e-mail, telephone, fax or letter regarding contractual matters. 3. Schedule OD requests, as needed. Calls for organizational development services are not scheduled in advance and requests for OD services can be sporadic–with many requests over a short period of time or intervals where little or no activity takes place. When offices need OD services, it is generally on a short turn-around time, sometimes immediately but usually within a week of the call for assistance. It is not possible, therefore, to establish a time schedule for OD interventions. The contractor’s schedule shall allow for flexibility of scheduling so that when the requests are made, the services can be provided. 4. Schedule additional OD interventions for the Headquarters and the regional offices, upon request from the PO. Such scheduling includes clearing the date with the instructor and advising the PO that the instructor has been confirmed to conduct the session. 5. Provide the PO with an OD facilitator roster, within 20 days after contract award. The roster shall include for each facilitator his/her full name, telephone number and facsimile number. 6.

1.2.  MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS.

1.2.1.  Monthly Inspections.  The following shall be performed at monthly intervals.

1.2.1.1.  Car Operation.  Contact the building representative and ask him if he has any comments on the performance of the equipment.  Investigate any reports of faulty operation.  Then ride each car and observe and note the riding quality, car stop and door operation.  Check safety ray and saf-t-edge, see that they are operating properly.  Investigate any unusual noise or condition and make necessary corrections.

1.2.1.2.  Control Panel.  

1.2.1.2.1.  Observe the operation of the equipment while the system is in normal operation.  Check the sequence of operation, look for any sign of faulty operation.  Is there any sign of excessive heat, noise or dirt?  Be on the lookout for telegraphing or slow relays.

CAUTION:  Never disturb relays that affect the operation of the elevator or the doors while the car is in service.

1.2.1.2.2.  Shut down the equipment as required and make a physical inspection of all parts.  Examine such items as air gaps, control follow up, worn contacts and shunts and coil insulation.  Check, adjust if required and record the rectified voltage.  Test firefighter service. 

1.2.1.3.  Hydraulic Power Unit.  Remove the covers and observe the operation of the power unit as the car makes a run in each direction.  Look for any oil leaks or unusual noise.  On the up run the pump should run for approximately one second after the car stops.  Correct any oil leaks.  Replace covers.  Check the level of the oil in the reservoir.  Keep a record of any oil that is added.  Any lost oil indicates an oil leak.  This condition must be corrected.

1.2.1.4.  Pit, Jack and Piping.  Park the elevator high enough to safely enter the pit.  Install a support to prevent the elevator from moving down.  Clean the pit equipment and the pit floor.  Inspect the jackhead and piping for leaks.  Check Jack overflow bottle.

1.2.2.  Every three (3) months inspection.  The following shall be performed at 3 month intervals.

1.2.2.1.  Car Top Operator.  

1.2.2.1.1.  Clean the car top and all accessible equipment.
