<DESC>Background and Objectives:

In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) Executive Branch Policy Fellowship in Child Development Program.   The SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellowship program is designed to provide greater interaction between the developmental research community and federal research programs and policies. Following a two-week science policy orientation program at American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Fellows work as resident scholars in a federal agency that sponsors developmental research, providing advice and guidance to programs, and working in partnership with research teams within the federal government. 

The period of performance shall be from March 1, 2007 thru August 31, 2007 with one additional one-year option period.

Scope of Work:

The contractor will provide the OBSSR with an SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow (Fellow) to perform the following tasks:

?	Assist the Director and OBSSR staff in (1) the process of establishing directions for social and behavioral sciences research at the National Institutes of Health and (2) also assist in the scientific planning in a wide range of behavioral and social sciences topics while gaining an understanding of the role of science administrators in the scientific process. 

?	In collaboration with OBSSR and NICHD colleagues, plan a conference/workshop on the evaluation of early childhood interventions.  A focus of the conference/workshop will be the methods for measuring child parent interactions.

?	Assist OBSSR and NICHD colleagues in implementing the Workplace Workforce Mismatch Initiative.  Specifically, assist in planning the 2nd conference, which will examine current workplace policies and programs, state and federal laws and policies pertaining to work, and employees? notions about workplace policies and programs.

?	Serve as the OBSSR Representative to the National Children?s Study.  This task involves attending the regular planning meetings and monitoring the role of behavioral and social sciences research in the design of the study.  Provide staff support as assigned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on cataloguing the available instruments to measure experience of racism to support the efforts of this study.

?	Serve as the OBSSR liaison person to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).  Attend the NICHD Advisory Council Meeting and report to the OBSSR on current and proposed initiatives relevant to behavioral and social sciences research.

?	In collaboration with OBSSR staff, NICHD, NHLBI, and other NIH ICs, and the CDC, plan a workshop on how to untangle the role of occupation from other common socioeconomic determinants in the social variation in most health outcomes in the US population.

?	Serve as OBSSR Representative to the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort.  This is a Department of Education study that has NIH support.  The Fellow will coordinate the review of applications for a training session on the use of this database.  The Fellow also attends regular planning meetings and reports to OBSSR.

?	Serve as OBSSR Representative to the Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Coordinating Committee.  The Fellow attends meetings and prepares reports on OBSSR activities in this area.

?	The Fellow will be responsible to perform other duties as assigned to help meet the pressing needs of the office on a day-to-day basis.


Sole Source Justification:

The Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) is the only organization that can provide an SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow on March 1, 2007 as required by OBSSR.  The SRCD has identified Dr. Dara Blachman as a candidate who is willing and qualified to perform the tasks identified above.  

Contractor Qualifications:

The SRCD was founded in 1933 to advance research in child development, to foster an interdisciplinary consideration of substantive and methodological problems in the field of child development, and to encourage applications of research findings.  The Society publishes two journals, a newsletter, a membership directory, and a social policy report; holds biennial meetings in March or April of odd-numbered years; sponsors conferences; and supports a Washington, DC-based policy and communications office.  Its membership of more than 5,600 is representative of the various disciplines and professions that contribute to knowledge of child development.  

Under the guidance of the Committee on Policy and Communications, the Society helps to bring the results of research to bear on the formulation of policy affecting children and families.  One way this is done is through the Society for Research in Child Development Policy Fellowships.  Since 1978, SRCD has recruited and facilitated the placement of more than 60 AAAS congressional and (since 1991) executive branch fellows.  The goals of these fellowships are to contribute to the effective use of scientific knowledge in developing public policy, to educate the scientific community about the development of public policy, and to establish a more effective liaison between scientists and the federal policy-making mechanisms.

Evaluation Criteria:

The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to allow NIH to evaluate the following criteria for award.  Criterion A:  (50 points) - Vendor must have at least 15 years experience in the area of child development and executive branch policy, as well as an in-depth understanding of the role played by social and behavioral sciences research within the NIH mission.  Vendor must be experienced in placing research and policy fellows within the executive branch (specifically NIH).   Criterion B:  (50 points) - Vendor must have an executive branch fellow with a Ph.D. in psychology from a highly rated academic program.  The fellow must also have extensive experience in psychology, child development policy, and the behavioral and social sciences.  


This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responses received by 4PM EST on February 23, 2007 will be considered by NLM.  The quoter shall include all information, which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. 

NLM Synopsis No. 07-072SB shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurment may be sent electronically to Sally Boakye, boakyes@mail.nih.gov .

The U.S. Air Force Surgeon Generals (AF/SG) mission is to develop and implement medical programs and policies that provide for the health care of active duty and retired military personnel and their family members.     AF/SG optimizes Air Force readiness potential to support national security strategies and defines and disseminates health care policy in support of the 42,000 personnel of the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), the 20,000 members assigned to the AF Reserves and the Air National Guard, and 74 medical treatment facilities (MTFs).     In addition, AF/SG ensures a quality, cost-effective, prevention-based health care continuum for 2.4 million beneficiaries worldwide.     The AF/SG serves as the functional manager of the AFMS.     In this capacity, AF/SG advises the Secretary of the Air Force and Air Force Chief of Staff, as well as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, on matters pertaining to the medical aspects of the air expeditionary force and the health of Air Force personnel.     The AF/SG has the authority to commit resources worldwide for the AFMS, to make decisions affecting the delivery of medical services, and to develop plans, programs and procedures to support worldwide medical service missions.     The Office of Headquarters, U.S. Air Force Surgeon General, Modernization Directorate (HQ AF/SGR), is charged with identifying shortfalls within the current health delivery system and planning, programming, budgeting, and fielding the technology and services required to surmount that shortfall.     
The scope of this effort encompasses identification, exploration, demonstration, and validation of new, advanced diagnostic technologies in realistic scenarios.     Research program areas focus on specialized medical materiel or procedures designed to enhance force health protection, restore health, prevent casualties, and maintain a fit and healthy force.     The scope of this effort and the priorities attached to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian medical science and technology, operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. The extramural research and development program plays a vital role in the fulfillment of the objectives established by the AFMS. 
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is intended to solicit research ideas, and is issued under the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369), as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).     This Announcement provides a general description of AFMS research programs, including specific areas of interest, general information, the evaluation and selection criteria, and proposal instructions.     The Appendices include forms that are required with the submission of a full proposal.     Research proposals are sought from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, private industry, and military organizations.     This announcement is open from 7 Feb 2007 through 7 May 2007.     Pre-proposals may be submitted and will be evaluated during this open period, unless otherwise noted or stated in a separate announcement.     Unsolicited proposals can be received at any time per FAR 15.6.

The AFDW/A7KM has contractual responsibility for the BAA as advertised under FEDBIZOPPS.     The BAA will be revised as other internal Air Force electronic processes are developed.     Amendments will be advertised in FEDBIZOPPS (www.fedbizopps.gov).     From time-to-time separate announcements or calls for proposals may supplement this BAA. 

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS BAA 07-01 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND BAA 07-01 APPENDICES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING PRE-PROPOSALS.     PRE-PROPOSALS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPENDIX 1 OR THEY WILL NOT BE EVALUATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to acquire Employee Assistance services for employees of NGA.  A Top Secret Clearance/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance is preferred but not mandatory.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods. The period of performance will be from date of contract award (estimated to be 1 May 2007) through May 2012, including options.   This acquisition will be solicited and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures. 
The NGA Human Development Directorate (HD) has a requirement for Employee Assistance services to support the needs of NGA employees and their family members. NGA provides employees and family members with Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services such as counseling on relationships, stress management, balancing work/life issues, substance abuse, depression & anxiety, grief/loss counseling, chronic medical and physical problems, and parenting concerns.  Additionally, referral services are provided for child & elder care, legal and financial needs. 
This requirement is for full and open competition. The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Questions will be received until 9 February 2007 at noon EST.  Only questions that may have a material change to the RFP will be accepted after 9 February 2007.   Questions and answers will be posted on FBO. Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Solicitation HM1576-07-R-0002 is scheduled for release on 2 February 2007, with a closing date of 28 February 2007. No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored.

It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTeDS (https://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure  Precipitation Static Test Sets with the capability of pinpointing airframe bonding issues on the P-3, E-6, and EA-6B aircraft platforms. The current P-STAT Test Sets are used by the Navy for pin-pointing the areas prone to P-Static problems such as:  Fin Caps, Tail Cones, Structural Plates, Antenna Mounting, Inspection Panels, Bonding Straps, Radomes, etc.

The objectives for this procurement are to provide the Navy with portable, ruggedized, lightweight P-STAT Test Sets while satisfying aircraft maintenance needs with a modified commercial variant of the current P-STAT Test Set. The new P-STAT Test Set shall be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified COTS item.

The P-STAT Test Set shall be capable of inducing a localized, high voltage static charge onto the outer skin of the aircraft to simulate actual atmospheric precipitation conditions that occur during aircraft flight. The Test Set shall also be capable of inducing three types of electrical discharge generated by problem areas on the aircraft: Metal-to-Metal Arcing/Sparking, Corona Discharge, and Streamering Effects. The Test Set shall be capable of charging windshields, radomes, and other non-metal surfaces, as well as charging isolated metal sections. Based on the high voltage produced by the P-STAT Test Set, risk of shock or electrocution is a primary concern. The procurement of a common piece of support equipment will allow for configuration control and common operation practices, as well as logistics support.  

The Government intends to procure up to a maximum of (50) P-STAT Test Sets over the life of the contract. The first (3) P-STAT Test Sets shall be pilot production units procured under the first delivery order under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract along with associated technical and logistics data and training. Delivery of the (3) pilot production units and associated technical and logistics data and training will take place within 330 days after date of delivery order award. The pilot production units shall be used for pilot production testing and supportability evaluation/approval testing. Upon completion of contractor pilot production testing and Government suitability/supportability evaluation, up to a maximum of (47) production units may be procured under one or more delivery orders. Delivery of the production units and associated technical and logistics data will take place within 6 months after date of delivery order award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm-fixed price effort.

The contractor shall organize, coordinate, and control all program activities to ensure compliance with the contract requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services. The contractor shall provide necessary system engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the SOW and the Performance Specification.

The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website located at http://www.navair.navy.mil on or about 28 FEBRUARY 2007. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The point of contact is: James W. Maxwell, phone: (732) 323-4589, FAX: (732) 323-2359, email: james.w.maxwell@navy.mil.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to the INDUS Corporation pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC) Information Technology and Communications Directorate (ITCD).  This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-02038 for a period of 6-months from February 28, 2007 through August 31, 2007 and increase the total CORE contract value and IDIQ maximum ordering value.  ITCD is currently working to refine their technical requirements in order to go forward with the most efficient and effective set of technical requirements for follow-on to the current BASE contract.	This extension will allow for a continuation of current service orders issued, for modifications to existing service orders, and for new work until the BASE competitive follow on contract is awarded.  The contract extension and total CORE contract value and IDIQ maximum ordering value are necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts to the BASE program The current Contractor provides the following mission critical services to NASA's GSFC ITCD: program management services; computer operations services; business infrastructure support services; application development, deployment, enhancement, and continuous support for business information systems; and sustaining engineering support.  INDUS Corporation, as the current incumbent, has the combined training, experience and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support.  Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, INDUS is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA's GSFC needs given the short period of performance for the extension.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 PM. local time on February 22, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>ROBIN S. HARRIS, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 919-541-0955, E-Mail: harris.robin@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), School of Public Health, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 to analyze 220 urine samples for metabolites associated with environmental exposure to poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH?s) for the Mechanistic Indicators of Childhood Asthma (MICA) Study.   The UNC laboratory has experience analyzing PAH urinary metabolites, with the required sensitivity, through their publications on studies of occupationally exposed individuals and controls (jet fuel workers, coke oven workers). UNC has also demonstrated ability to produce meta analysis reports comparing the results of their studies to that of other studies, including a national representative sampling study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). UNC has access to all of the data from their occupational studies and the CDC study.  Access to this data and the resulting report is critical to the MICA study because EPA seeks to compare levels of chemical markers in children relative to levels of chemical markers in other national data bases (like CDC) and to levels of chemical markers in urine that would be detected in occupationally exposed individuals or these studies' control populations.   In this way, EPA can better understand the body burden measurements in children relative to adults, environmental exposures vs occupational exposures, and relationships between internal measures of these  chemicals and health outcome measures.  Therefore,  EPA believes that UNC is the only vendor qualified with the expertise capable of satisfying this requirement.   The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" at this time.  The anticipated period of performance is 36 months.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO Aoolied Mathematics, Inc., 1622 Rout 12, Gales Ferry, CT 06335-1532. The following sets forth the background, objectives, and required services of the anticipated contract: 
Background: Numerous algorithms have been fielded as an integral part of the tactical control and sonar systems.  While guidance exist on how to set up and operate the algorithms, scenario driven tactical guidance on the preferred algorithm employment to optimize solution generation does not exist.  The lack of tailored guidance based on performance against real-world and exercise data sets sub-optimizes the tactical employment of these advanced systems. The objective is to transform the accumulated knowledge from numerous exercises and at-sea test data into scenario driven tactical algorithm employment guidance.  The final product will be the development of a TACMEMO.  During the development of the TACMEMO the need for a TACAID may be identified. If necessary the contractor shall develop and deliver the TACAID.

SPECIFIC TASKS: TASK 1: POA&M.  Develop an initial draft Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) and provide a written POA&M report (electronic media).  The purpose of this report is twofold: (1) present a plan of action, and (2) establish key milestones. This report shall document the results of initial project data research and analysis.  It shall outline project analysis objectives, describe analytical approach, and identify project assumptions/ constraints/ limitations.  The primary objective of the POA&M Report is to provide a clearly defined plan for developing the final end-product(s), and should be used to identify shortfalls in available data and determine if there is a requirement to conduct any type of exercise or test.  If testing is required, this report shall attempt to identify specific test opportunities and assets.  The report should also identify the final products (i.e., TACMEMO, TACAID or both).  The POA&M Report will list all milestones for the project deliverables?.  
Due date: 15 days after contract award.  TASK 2:   An Initial Concept Brief (ICB) outlining the POA&M shall be provided to the Project Sponsor, Project Manager, and Program Director, and a hard copy of the presentation shall be provided to ICB attendees.  The POA&M shall have been revised based on feedback received on review of the initial draft POA&M. Due date: 45 days after contract award. TASK 3: Analysis Report:  Provide a written report to document the analysis.  The report will provide recommendations on objectives, threats to be analyzed (both areas and platforms), and format for the TACMEMO.  Identify missing information deemed critical to development of the TACMEMO.  Identify deficiencies in tactics and guidance currently provided to submarines for employment of combat control system solution development algorithms.  Identify data from several sensor and tactical control system bearing accuracy exercises executed with controlled geometries and the necessary data sets required for algorithm testing. This analysis report shall be used to identify shortfalls in available data and requirements for at-sea testing. 
Due date: 60 days prior to start of testing. TASK 4:  Tactical Memorandum.  A TACMEMO will provide the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to address and correct the tactical deficiency.  The TACMEMO shall include an evaluation plan with associated MOEs/MOPs to guide post-development validation.  Due date:  60 days prior to end of contract. C.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498, for a three-year (one base year and two one-year options) production procurement for the fiscal years (FY) 2008 through 2010 for the AN/ARC-210 family of Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment requirements for domestic and foreign military sales (FMS).  The FY08 through FY10 procurement requirements include up to approximately 3000 AN/ARC-210 family of EP radios consisting of the RT-1556B, RT-1747D, RT-1824(C), RT-1794(C), RT-1851(C), RT-1851A(C) and FMS variants, inclusive of options and associated equipment; a Standard Commercial Warranty, support equipment; engineering technical support; integrated logistics support; spare and repair parts; and associated data.  The RT-1556B configuration functional capabilities include simplex two-way communication of normal and secure voice amplitude modulated (AM) or frequency modulated (FM) signals in the 30.000 MHz to 400 MHz radio frequency (RF) bands.  The RT-1556B also provides the following modes of operation: a dedicated guard receiver which can provide continuous monitoring of the guard frequency in UHF/VHF bands of 243.000 MHz or 121.500 MHz, a receive-only mode of operation in normal and secure voice from 108.000 through 117.9975 MHz (AM), a maritime mode of operation in the 156.000 MHz through 162.025 MHz frequency band, and variable AM and FM electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) mode(s), these being HAVEQUICK, HAVEQUICK II, and SINCGARS.  The RT-1556B utilizes several types of data buses to convey control and status information among the various WRAs making up the system.  These include the MIL-STD-1553B AVMUX Bus, the Remote Control Data Bus, the Antenna and Filter Data Bus, and the DS-101 Data Loading Bus.  The RT-1556B provides 8.33 kHz channel spacing capability for compatibility with EuroCae (ED-23B), and is software loadable using Advanced Memory Loader Verifier (AMLV).  The RT-1747D has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus an added 70 MHz half-duplex converter and the software needed to select half-duplex channels, including SATCOM channels, and operates in the 70 MHz half-duplex mode for UHF beyond line of sight operation.  The RT-1794(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus added capabilities including embedded COMSEC, embedded DAMA for UHF SATCOM, Link 4/4A/11/Aircraft Carrier Landing System (ACLS), MIL-STD-188-220A protocol implementing Variable Message Format, and DS-101 COMSEC keyfill capability.  The RT-1824(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1794(C).  The RT-1824(C) provides hardware compatibility for future DAMA A SATCOM interoperability, a plain text data mode, and enhanced VMF message processing.  The RT-1851(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1824(C), and incorporates an embedded FM Immunity filter and upgraded processors, allowing for software upgrades to add Bandwidth Efficient Advanced Modulation (BEAM), a waveform compression algorithm providing 80 kb/s in a 25kHz SatCom channel and 80 kb/s in a 25kHz LOS channel.  The RT-1851A(C) extends the frequency range to 512MHz to provide interoperability with land-based civil agencies.  The FY08 through FY10 procurement will be supported by an organizational to commercial depot maintenance strategy.  RCGS is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the AN/ARC-210 Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment and is the only firm with the necessary knowledge, data, equipment, and experience to perform this effort within the required time frame.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This follow-on contract will require from the outset, and at all time s during the performance term, a sufficient number of fully-qualified personnel with experience to provide the full range of help desk, network operations, and other (technical) research, development, testing and evaluation activities (as directed).  Thi s also includes leasing of office automation equipment and supplies.  The current TATRC staff member would not be able to perform their assigned tasks without the services and support this contract offers.  In addition, the delay to get a new contractor on board and equipment leased will have an adverse impact on operations at the TATRC West Coast office.  In essence, TATRC staff members will have to stop work until new office automation equipment could be ordered.  Also, trying to get a new contractor to pr ovide another set of leased equipment to take the place of the current equipment would be more expensive then awarding this contract to Capitol IT Solutions.  This difference in cost is not anticipated to be recovered through competition.  In the meantime,  TATRC senior staff is currently strategizing on the validity of keep this facility open beyond the building lease expiration of September 2007.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No s olicitation document is available and telephone request will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be  advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the service will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discret ion of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, 14 February 2007.  EMAIL: michelle.maldonado@amedd.army.mil.

IxChariot console Seat License, 10 concurrent users.  Software maintenance. 2) Identify the statutory authority permitting this non-competitive procurement : 6.302-1	Only one responsible source and No Other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  This software is the existing DTS-PO standard for service/network testing.  This is an upgrade/increase of software already in use by the DTS-PO.  Since the network has grown, more licenses are necessary to meet out testing needs.  This software must be used as a console/endpoint matching combination.  Other testing software does not interoperate with this software. 3) Describe the efforts that the COTR and Requesting Office made to ensure that the supplies/services describedabove could be solicited from as many potential sources as practicable: Other testing systems, both hardware and and software, were tested previously by the DTS-PO.  In addition, many other testing systems have been purchased and are in the DTS-PO lab.  They have been evaluated.  The Ixia Chariot software was chosen to best suit our distributed testing requirements. 4) Describe the market survey conducted and the results and attach a copy if documented elsewhere, or provide a statement of the reasons market survey was not conducted.  When potential sources other than the company identified herin are available, identify the circumstances which preclude their solicitation for this requirement: This is an upgrade to our existing testing capability.  As the number of systems under test increase more licenses are needed.  Since the software is already in use within the DTS, only upgrades to the existing licenses are necessary.  These upgrades are only available from the creator/developer of the software.   5) Identify the Companys unique qualifications or describe the circumstances of the procurement that justify the use of that authority. Ixia is the developer of the software.  It is no resold by other sellers. 6) Discuss any actions that could be taken to encourage competition for future acquisitions of similar supplies/services: The market for testing software is limited.  The government could encourage this vendor to offer their software for sale by other resellers and allow it to be bundled in other systems.<BR><BR>

1.0	PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The Global IT Modernization Program under the purview of the Director of IRM/OPS/PMA is responsible for refreshing 25% of overseas workstations, and a percentage of OpenNet printers for overseas sites on an annual basis.   Due to the continuous pressure to reduce IT life cycle costs, PMA is exercising due diligence in exploring potential alternative methodologies to meet current operational requirements.  Vendors will be responsible for storing OpenNet workstations and printers at their facility, installing a GITM provided image on DoS OpenNet workstations, power on and print test OpenNet printers, provide GITM with location specific serial numbers for CPU?s, monitors and printers, and notification when subject equipment is inducted into shipping consistent with Diplomatic Pouch Guidelines and Restrictions to DoS Embassies and Consulates overseas.   

2.0	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

GITM will provide the vendor with site specific quantities in addition to providing updated copies and or access to the Unclassified Diplomatic Pouch Guidelines and Restrictions for packing / shipping instructions.  No partial shipments of workstations, monitors and printers are authorized.  All shipments must be 100 percent complete.  The Department of State will reimburse for shipping expenses upon receipt of GBL?s / invoices. 

For the purposes of this RFI, vendors can assume a total of 262 overseas sites in addition to the following quantities in determining their cost estimates:

Annual Quantity of Overseas OpenNet Workstations:  6,067
Annual Quantity of Overseas OpenNet Monitors: 6,067
Annual Quantity of Overseas OpenNet Printers:  970

Workstation Imaging

GITM would provide a bootable ISO image (DVD - over 2 GB) that would need to be applied to every workstation prior to shipment.  This image would be made available on a DoS FTP site, or uploaded to a vendor FTP site.  Reasonable advance notice (at least several days) would be given of the release of a new version.  See Attachment (A).  

Note:  The GITM image is structured to permit the addition of new drivers, hot fixes, or new software to the workstation during the loading of the image on the workstations.  Additional software such as the types mentioned above could be released by GITM at any time for incorporation into the new workstations and GITM would provide advance notice.  The vendor must provide prompt notification to GITM of any problems with an image.

GITM will provide a power cord to be included with each workstation to be included with the shipment.  
All equipment must be labeled with an approved U.S. Government Unclassified property label (DoS provided).  

GITM Quality Assurance personnel will perform periodic random sampling to verify / validate compliance of the workstation imaging process at the vendor facility.  

The vendor will provide a weekly status report documenting the following areas:

?	Total number of workstations imaged
?	Total number of printers tested
?	Total number of locations awaiting shipment (staged for shipping)
?	Total number of shipments by location 
?X	Serial Numbers
?X	Part Number
?X	Manufacturer
?X	Date shipped
?	Total number of DOA equipment

The vendor must provide GITM with a shipping manifest prior to actual shipping.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer
<SOLNBR>NRMJ2000-6-03025DT

<CONTACT>Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3872, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email doris.p.turner@noaa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the period of performance for the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer being leased from the University of Idaho.  It is now expected to remain in place in Eureka, Canada through February 1, 2008.  Any responses are required to be submitted in writing no later than February 23, 2007.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Idaho, Dept. of Geography, 875 Perimeter Dr., Moscow, ID 83844-3021 to lease a Polar-adapted, low maintenance, Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (P-AERI) to be deployed in Eureka, Canada for the amended period February 1, 2006 through February 1, 2008. Collaborators from the Canadian Network for Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC) Program are planning to commission an AERI-ER system from the University of Wisconsin for long term deployment in Eureka, Canada but the CANDAC system is not expected to be operational until early 2007 at the earliest. An AERI-ER system is needed to monitor crucial atmosphere/climate parameters until the CANDAC system is available and tested in Eureka. The Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) is an important instrument for Arctic research and monitoring that measure downwelling spectral infrared radiance from approximately 3 - 20 microns. AERI spectra provide information on key Arctic parameters such as cloudy conditions, fractional cloud cover, and infrared cloud radiative forcing. Furthermore, AERI spectra provide information on total column abundances of some atmospheric trace gases including H2O, CO2, O3, CH4, and HNO3, which play significant roles in climatically important processes such as the carbon and ozone cycles. The extended range AERI (AERI-ER) is particularly well suited for many of these observations because it provides both high accuracy and precision and can operate in the polar darkness when solar transmission instruments are not useful.  

The system is required to have a 1/cm resolution, a spectral range of at least 3-20 microns, a robust and documented calibration, shall operate autonomously, and be specifically adapted to operate in Polar environments. Prior successful operation in Polar conditions must be demonstrated. In addition, quality controlled data sets, containing calibrated spectral radiance measurements at the specified resolution and spectral range, must be provided to NOAA within three months of observation time.

This announcement is being issued under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any responses shall be received in writing no later than February 23, 2007. Anticipated Award date is February 26, 2007.

There is no solicitation available at this time.  PM-S KOT is seeking POTENTIAL SOURCES who have the capability to provide the container as specified in the below-referenced web-link. A general description is as follows:  The container will store heavy duty construction equipment such as 40+ lb pavement breake rs, concrete saws, chain saws, grinders, etc, as well as miscellaneous items that support a new system.  The shipping constraints of air transportation and the Primary Mover (M1084 5ton truck) limit the container dimensions.  Our intention is to package ou r tools in a container so that we do not protrude above the top of the cab, keeping transport issues to a minimum.  Also, to protect the equipment from outer elements (heat, rain, water, sand, etc) while stowed.  The following information is available on-l ine at https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/SOWandSPECS/index.htm - Tool Load, Crane Specs, Cab Space and Container Specifications.  Quantities are not know at this time, but it is estimated that approximately 1,000/year would be required.  Responses mus t include the weight of the container, as well as the maximum weight the container can hold. Estimated price and delivery schedule is also requested.  Interested sources should respond by 23 February 2007 to Cindy Wagoner at cindy.kay.wagoner@conus.army.mi l Questions may be directed to Cindy Wagoner at (309)782-0246.

<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, P. O. Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail:  tbrookie@usgs.gov.  The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Energy Team, has a requirement to obtain a database with extensive worldwide coverage that contains organic geochemical data on oil and gas samples from exploratory wells and producing fields.  The database must be in digital form with precise location information such that data can be plotted on maps using Geographic Information System (GIS) computer software.  Access to such a database is critical to the identification and mapping of petroleum systems for the World Energy assessment project and for future National assessments.  The petroleum database must contain oil and gas data on at least 7000 oils and 2000 natural gases.  The database shall be manipulated using Access (TM) and is displayed via the ArcView (TM)  GIS.  This database shall be updated every six months.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the requirement specified as a sole source from GeoMark Research, Inc., 9748 Whithorn Drive, Houston, TX 77095, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the requirement specified are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>This is not an announcement of a Solicitation, it is only a Request for Information (RFI), and a request for proposals may or may not result from it. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to assess external capabilities to provide Landsat-like satellite data on a global scale in the event of a Landsat system failure and ensuing data gap.  Interested parties from U.S. or international industry and/or government programs are welcome to respond. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) that seeks to identify potential suppliers of moderate resolution satellite data with characteristics reasonably similar to those of Landsat to cover the global landmass at least twice per year - cloud free or nearly so. This data requirement is defined by the "Gap-filler Data: Acceptable Specifications" column in the following table.  These specifications were developed by a multi-agency Landsat Data Gap Study Team.  Data meeting the Acceptable Specifications would replace (in quantity and quality) a portion of the Landsat data stream should Landsat fail but may also be useful for ongoing augmentation of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) beginning in 2011.  If obtained, Gap-filler data would be placed in the USGS satellite archive and distributed to the Landsat user community under the current unrestricted data-use policy. It is anticipated that any significant procurement of Gap-filler data would not occur before FY2008, although it is possible that data could be needed sooner.

For example, show and discuss any differences from the nominal bandwidths.  Acquired data will be characterized and verified against these specifications to ensure data quality and continuity. Data processing could be performed by the provider or by the USGS with provided ground processing systems/algorithms needed for creating Level 0 and Level 1 orthorectified products.   The USGS is also interested in learning about new approaches or new technology for collection of Gap-filler data even if they do not meet the entire Acceptable Specifications criteria and twice-annual global coverage.  For example frequent coverage of Gap-filler data limited to the conterminous U.S. would be considered, as would the concept of frequent global coverage with more limited spectral bands than Landsat.  Providers may provide base pricing, only as a matter of interest, to the USGS.     A formal solicitation or contract may or may not result from this RFI announcement.  All responsible sources are encouraged to respond via email by March 27, 2007 to Joanne Lowe, Contracting Officer at jlowe@usgs.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING ANNOUNCEMENT N68335-07-T-0013 ? NEXT GENERATION VISUAL LANDING AID (NGVLA)

The Industry Day Briefing will not occur on 13-14 February 2007.  It is anticipated that the Industry Day Briefing will take place on 21-22 February 2007.  These dates are subject to change.  Location and arrangements will be forthcoming.

At this time, there are no specifications available for release.  

Please ensure a certified DD Form 2345 is completed and provided to the NAVAIR Contracting Office (Fax # 732-323-7192) prior to attending the briefing.


This is a Request for Information and Notice of Conference.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources that can design, develop, manufacture, integrate hardware and software, test and support components for a Next Generation Visual Landing Aid (NGVLA) system).  The NGVLA is intended to be the Navy?s newest shipboard Visual Landing Aid system capable of guiding the present and future naval rotary wing aircraft along with Unmanned Air Vehicles for safe landings.  The NGVLA is being developed for forward fit into the DDG1000 class destroyers, with potential applications for other future surface combatants.  The major design objectives for the NGVLA are: improve reliability, reduce maintenance & manpower, meet specific requirements of the DDG1000 functionality, mounting configurations, power and controls, lower radar cross section, and meet Night Vision Device compatibility requirements.  Proposed performance parameters for the new NGVLA will be sent to interested parties upon request from the Naval Air Engineering Station Contracting Officer on a CD.  The NGVLA program will reflect a system?level acquisition approach for three new components of the total system, which will each be contracted separately.  The Navy?s goal is to develop and procure an entire NGVLA system (Multi Function Display (MFD), new Stabilized Glideslope Indicator (SGSI), and a new Flight Deck Lighting (FDL) system with associated interfaces.). Contracts for each component development and test are anticipated with follow-on options for production quantities and Logistics support. The government intends to structure a program that is economically feasible while meeting the needs of the fleet.  This may result in the contractor(s) pricing out one or more of the NGVLA components as a Modified Cots option. The SGSI is composed of a stabilized optical projector which projects Green-Yellow-Red beams of light corridors for pilots to receive a visual cue of correct glideslope.  In the Night Vision Device mode, the pilots will receive pulse coded signals for proper glideslope approach. The MFD consists of a ?bill-board? type display mounted on the ship?s superstructure above the hangar doors. The MFD will present a horizon reference bar and deck status indication, with capability for future expansion. The FDL is composed of all of the deck lighting an other approach and obstruction indicators required for US Navy aviation certification. All of the control for power, brightness/dimming, fault indication, and status display will be interfaced through the ships Total Ships Computing Environment Infrastructure ( TSCEI ) system. Operator control functions will be provided by the ship?s CEDS displays.  Interface to the ships data distribution for control and interface will be specified in the respective component specifications.  The development effort is anticipated to be conducted through an Integrated Product Team (IPT) structure. The IPT will consist of the contractor/ NGVLA component designor, the ship builder and NAWC Lakehurst NGVLA team members.    The first phase to be executed is the Development phase. During the Development phase, contractors will develop program plans, Develop and produce the System Development & Demonstration SDD hardware, and test to prove compliance with specification requirements.  A single contract will be awarded for the (SDD) phase (formally Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) phase) through a fully integrated, production representative system for Technical and Operational Evaluation. (plus additional subsystems/ components required to support environmental and shock qualification of the system components). The SDD system may initially be tested at the NAWCADLKE Test Site. Following successful completion of an initial Developmental Test (DT) program, the system may be refurbished and installed aboard the DDG1000.   The SDD phase will begin in FY 07 and continue into FY 08 (18 months). The test and integration phase is expected to last for 36 months, including shipboard install and test. Following a successful test at the land based test site or test facility and shipboard testing, a sole source contract for production quantities will be awarded to support DDG1000 class ship availabilities and possible other class installations. The production option contract is anticipated to be a sole source, fixed price incentive (FPI) contract for production units including technical and logistic data to support DDG1000 class installation availabilities.  Options will be included to support the DDG1000 construction schedule. 
 The Navy will host an Industry Briefing at NAWCAD Lakehurst, New Jersey on or about January 10 & 11, 2006 to discuss the program goals and technical requirements, present government information, anticipated scope of effort and background and to answer questions.  Draft copies of the program plan, SOW and Specifications for each respective component will be available prior to the meeting upon request.  Specific meeting location and agenda will be provided pending receipt of participant?s request to attend.  If you plan to attend the industry brief, please submit a fax to the Contracting Officer at (732) 323-4822 with the company name/address, names and positions of attendees, and citizenship of attendees.   Attendance is limited to U.S. citizens and authorized foreign nationals only. You must obtain the proper security authorization through your respective embassy for foreign national participation. Your request must be received not later than 1600 on 4 January 2006 to obtain access. Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.  In order to facilitate the question and answer period, you are requested to submit preliminary questions to the contracting officer no later than 4 January 2006.  Note that information to be provided is subject to export controls.  Please ensure a certified DD From 2345 is completed prior to attending the conference, in order to receive information.

<DESC>Market Survey / Sources Sought Announcement

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the  National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is seeking the assistance of an organization capable of providing information regarding genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, in-stent restenosis in support to the CardioGene Study being conducted by the NHGRI.  

This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.   A market survey is being conducted to determine the availability and potential technical capability of businesses to provide support to The Nabel Laboratory, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences, with a size standard of 500 employees. 

The Nabel Laboratory, NHGRI has conducted a genomic analysis of the vascular disease, in-stent restenosis.  This study, titled the CardioGene (protocol #02-H-0102) is a large body of work that has been ongoing in Dr. Nabel?s laboratory for several years. We have identified several candidate genes that are linked to the disease. Scientifically, it is necessary to investigate whether these genes are linked with restenosis in another population.   NHGRI is in need of finding a resource capable of providing a large biorepsoitory in which patients present to a cardiac catheterization laboratory and are enrolled in a longitudinal study with DNA samples and clinical data available for collaborative research.

A crucial area of research in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) of the NHGRI is to understand the genetic susceptibility to common, complex diseases. As a study of a complex cardiovascular disease, the CardioGene Study is an excellent example of a cardiovascular clinical study that aims to understand the genetic susceptibility of complex diseases. To determine the significance of findings from the CardioGene Study, further studies in independent cohorts is needed, and these are not available currently within the DIR. Therefore, the NHGRI DIR has a need to find a resource that can provide such patient samples and clinical data for analysis from several hundred unrelated patients who have received bare metallic stents and have restenosis outcomes after stenting.

The data obtained from this study will significantly enhance the information gathered by the CardioGene Study. The merging of these scientific elements from the CardioGene Study and further validation analyses in an independent cohort of patients treated with stents will offer a direct benefit to patients in making a determination of which patients are likely to respond best to stent placement in addition to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of restenosis, which will assist with the development of new targets to prevent and treat restenosis.

Specifically, the contractor shall:
1.	Include a sufficient number of patients who have received bare metallic stents prior to the widespread use of drug-eluting stents in the United States (2003).
2.	Provide clinical follow-up data for each patient is needed to determine restenosis outcomes 12 months post-stenting.
3.	Provide a medical history review to determine whether any bare metallic stent did or did not develop restenosis, so that determination of whether a patient has ever experienced restenosis may be made.
4.	Provide clinical data regarding demographics and catheterizations must be available.
5.	Provide high quality genomic DNA, which is obtained by purifying DNA from a blood sample.
6.	Provide assurance of patient confidentiality through the use of assigned study numbers to de-identify patient samples and clinical data.
7.	Obtain IRB approval for such a study.

This requirement will not involve either Government-furnished or contractor-acquired materials,
facilities, and/or equipment.  A fixed price, single award is anticipated, with an estimated performance period of seven (7) months from the date of award. 

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., large business, small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concern, Veteran, and or Service-disabled Veteran; 2) Business size information which states, the business size, annual receipts (average gross revenue) for the last three (3) fiscal years, and whether or not the firm has been approved as a small business by the SBA under the applicable NAICS code; and 3) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested.   If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to be considered technically capable in the performance this effort, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain full-time labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the ?limitation on subcontracting?  imposed on small business set-asides.   
 
The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) documented evidence which clearly reflects their organizational experience in providing sufficient number of patients who have received bare metallic stents prior to the widespread use of drug-eluting stents in the United States (2003).   2) documented experience in conducting patient related clinical cardio genetic clinical trials of a similar magnitude.  

Interested organizations responding to this survey are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.  Responding firms should provide one printed (1) copy and an electronic copy of a tailored  capability statement to the attention of Ms. Kesha L. Williams, Contract Specialist, within ten (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Room 6145, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902.   

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND ONE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.

<SUBJECT>Letter of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), intends to procure Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF) Support Equipment, on a sole source basis from Optikos Corporation of 286 Cardinal Medeiros Ave, Cambridge, MA 02141.  This procurement is being made in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The justification for such action is based on the findings of a commercial market analysis, that there is no other supplier or manufacturer in the optomechanics industry that can supply the Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF) with the required support equipment of: one (1) calibrated, photometric digital video camera with data collection and analysis and tools designed to measure the performance of optical and electro-optical devices and systems by imaging and analyzing the output display as well as a!  nalyzing the system under test.   Optikos Corporations products are used extensively throughout the photonics industry and within government laboratories and provide a critical capability to sensor evaluation laboratories.  The EOTF currently uses the TETS EOV to evaluate electro-optic imaging systems by digitizing the RS-170 output.  However, the EOTF requires the capability to quantitatively evaluate display quality and display artifacts as part of the overall system performance.  In order to accomplish this, a calibrated photopic camera, which mimics the human visual response, must monitor and analyze the display output while electro-optic systems are run through a series of tests.  The Photometric Camera must closely follow the human visual system photopic response and support interchangeable lenses for different magnifications.  The lens magnifications and photopic calibration must be NIST traceable.  In order toe ensure cost effectiveness and ease of operations, a single supplier is required for the c!  amera, lenses, data acquisitions and control systems to be readily configured for immediate operation.  This integrated capability reduces risk of integrating diverse components and readily translates to immediate EOTF operation and minimal development time.  Optikos Corporation can supply such a capability in a commercial off the shelf (COTS) solution and is the only known provider to meet these requirements.   The Performance Specification document for the EOTF Support Equipment is specified with minimum requirements in Attachment 1.  This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations; however, if you believe that your company can provide the required items, please call or e-mail the Contract Specialist.  Inquiries should be directed no later than 14 February 2007 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) to Sonya Powers, Contract Specialist at Sonya.powers.ctr@usmc.mil or via telephone at 703-432-3622, Reference: M67854-07-R-1027.  The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the PG-13 IWS/ONS Program requirements.     Note: If documents are sent via e-mail, the contractor will be responsible for validating Government receipt by calling the Contract Specialist,  Sonya Powers 703-432-3622.

<SUBJECT>A -- Quantum Chemical Modeling of Chemical Warfare Materials
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source, cost-plus-fixed fee contract to Auburn University, Auburn, AL, for Quantum Chemical Modeling of Chemical Warfare Materials.  Auburn University has been determined to be the only responsible source to fulfill this requirement.

DTRA has a vital interest in determining chemical species present in chemical weapons (CW) facilities that have been attacked by an agent defeat (AD) weapon.  Since these facilities are expected to be in denied areas, the ability to determine those chemical species must be accomplished at some distance.  This effort, entitled, Quantum Chemical Modeling of Chemical Warfare Materials, is to identify which chemical species will be created and released during the attack on specified chemical weapons materials (CWMs).

It is desirable to determine the products of combustion and/or pyrolysis reactions as a function of the temperatures that are realized by use of various weapons.  It is especially important to identify temperature ranges that result in the production of reaction products that minimize toxic hazards.  Both experimental and theoretical techniques are available for the determination of reaction products and for the identification of optimum temperature ranges.  

Cost mitigation while performing the Quantum Chemical Modeling of CWMs is also an important objective of this effort.

Duration of performance is a 12 month basic effort and two successive 12 month options.

The successful contractor will require access to classified information at the SECRET level.  

Contractual questions should be addressed to Mr. Russell Kelley, DTRA, at russell.kelley@dtra.mil.  

Questions regarding the availability of subcontracting opportunities should be addressed to:  Tony Ventimiglia at ventiaf@auburn.edu or 344 844 5954.    

Numbered Notes 22 and 25 apply.  In regards to note 22, the DTRA Contracting Office recommends interested parties submit White Papers, not-to-exceed five (5) pages, vice submitting a proposal for the Government to consider in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for this requirement.

<SUBJECT>U -- Education Methodology Project Evaluator Services
<DESC>This announcement is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) is conducting market research to determine the availability of contractors to perform an educational program methodology assessment for an Inter-American Foundation (IAF) grant recipient in the Andean highland communities of Cusco, Peru.  

The IAF is an independent agency of the United States government, established as part of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969. The mission of the IAF is to promote sustainable grassroots development throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.  To that end, the IAF provides cash grants directly to grassroots and community based organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean to help them implement their own creative ideas for development and poverty reduction.

The IAF defines "grassroots development" as the process by which disadvantaged people organize themselves to improve the social, cultural, and economic well being of their families, communities, and societies.  This concept is based on the premise that the key to sustainable democracies, equitable societies, and prosperous economies is a people oriented strategy that stresses participation, organization, development, and networking to build the social capital needed to complement human and physical assets.  As a pioneer
in grassroots development, the IAF seeks to support projects that produce real improvements on a local level, but that also have the potential to offer lessons and inspiration to others.

A project is being conducted by the Asociacion Cultural Ayllu Yupaychay YUPAY) to design, implement and evaluate a teaching methodology more appropriate for instructing indigenous youth in remote Andean highland communities of Cusco, Peru.

This unique project introduces a teaching methodology that builds on the cognitive skills of indigenous children and is substantially different from traditional methodologies that require learning skills unknown to the children.  The methodology employed during this Project utilizes the oral traditions and complex imagery that are part of Andean indigenous society and incorporates them into the cognitive exercises for the education of indigenous children.  Therefore the contractor must demonstrate extensive knowledge and experience with multi-sensory instructional methods, especially when used with young people who have consistently underachieved with contemporary educational methodologies.  The contractor must demonstrate expertise in the field of multiple intelligences through the authorship of refereed publications, evaluative reports, formal presentations, consultations, lectures or addresses before universities and organizations of professional educators or education administrators.  

The contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment to perform the methodology evaluation.  The contractor must demonstrate technical knowledge, experience and good interpretative and writing skills.  The contractor must possess field experience in the monitoring and evaluation of teaching methodologies that address the unique characteristics of the beneficiary group and the capacity to clearly and succinctly share findings with all interested parties.

The Contractor will perform the following tasks:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor?s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered.  The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Firms lacking a record of relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall receive a neutral evaluation.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category for the base year and each option year.  The labor category totals for the base year and each option year will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.   Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror?s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY AND SPECIFIC ID OF THE DOCUMENT AS A "Justification for other than full and open competition." US Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center.  HSCG44-07-Q-03NAIS001.  IAW FAR 6.302-1(iii).  This is part of an existing system. 

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRE, AND THE INTENDED USE: Need to replace existing PCS-100INS Radar Simulator due to multiple module failures. This model has been out of production for 2 years and is beyond economical repair, the PCS-200INS Radar Simulator is the replacement. The PCRadar user interface models the SPS-73 Radar display and provides target acquisition & tracking, leading vectors & history trails, trial maneuvers and navigation points. Target Track Data is also output via serial NMEA-0183 for integration with the Shipboard Command and Control System (SCCS). Simulated Radar and sensor data is critical to the engineering, stress testing, and acceptance testing of many C2CEN products.

UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  BCG simulators are currently the only devices that support the COMRIC interface which is the backbone of radar and AIS communication for the VTS, SCC, and COMDAC INS systems.  These simulators interface with existing systems at C2CEN which are used for software engineering and training for the SCCS systems. Radar Simulator Specs:PC-based, using latest Windows Operating System.;Single plug-in module design requiring minimal maintenance. Compatible with existing CSC/BCG network interface.
Single unit drives multiple radar displays from varying manufacturers, full ARPA support. NMEA-0183 Support, RS232, RS422, network.          Support for Automatic Identification System (AIS).Supports various radar and sensor failures.
Market research shows that BCG simulators are currently the only devices that support the COMRIC interface which is the backbone of radar and AIS communication for the VTS, SCC, and COMDAC INS systems.  The Enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUIenh) Software is proprietary to BCG. Using another vendor would require the development of a COMDAC interface, which only BCG has at this time, and would not allow us to combine multiple simulators in the building to create one multi-radar scenario.  (IAW FAR 6.302-1(iii).  This is part of an existing system.)
This is specialized equipment designed specifically to interface with COE base products with a COMRIC interface.  Interoperability with already purchased, deployed and currently in use machines provides a long term cost savings to the government vice developing an entire new system and deploying it Coast Guard wide. Questions may be directed to,  Carrie Houck (757) 686-4215,  Carrie.F.Houck@USCG.Mil or may be fax to (757) 686-4018, or mailed to the Contracting Officer, USCG, C2CEN 4000 Coast Guard Blvd. Portsmouth, VA 23703.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-APO1-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 22 FEB 2007, 5:00 P.M.

<DESC>J & A for Other Than Full and Open Competition.     Log Number 07-021 	            PRW NO: 78DMR2L00-0026 Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition 1.  Contracting Activity: The contracting activity responsible for Informix License Maintenance for the Defense Medical Logistics (DMLSS) Program is USAMRAA.  The requiring activity responsible for this action is the DMLSS Program Office, which is a compon ent of the Military Health Systems Program Executive Office Joint Medical Information System. The documentation provided shall serve as justification for entering into the referenced contract on the basis of services being available only from a single sou rce. 2.  Description of Action: This contracting action is for the continued service maintenance Agreement for Informix License maintenance worldwide for the DMLSS program. The DMLSS Program has a requirement for continuity of service supporting the current lic enses.  The manufacturers warranty that currently covers (either fully or partially) the licenses can not be provided by another vendor.  This would result in a break in service for coverage and the possibility of downtime for the logistics department if license maintenance is negated.  The current maintenance support contract number is W81XWH06-F-0073.  This action will cover maintenance requirements for calendar year 2007 for (12 months) with one option year.     3.  Description of Supplies or Services: $313,968.60. The contractor provides software license maintenance. Without support the DMLSS system would be in violation of the Authority to Operate (ATO).  4.  Authority Cited: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1.  Because of the specialized skills required for the DMLSS software application, only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements.  The skills an d services required are available from the original source. 5.  Reason for Authority Cited: IBM as the manufacturer would not honor the warranty if another vendor were given the service contract.  They are the only source for the DMLSS program to get this maintenance support 6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: None 7.  Actions to Increase Competition: None 8.  Market Survey: No Market Survey was performed since IBM, as the manufacturer, would not honor the warranty if another vendor were given the service contract.  They are the only source for this maintenance support. 9.  Interested Sources: No other sources have been identified or have approached the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support Program Office (DMLSS) regarding this work or follow-on effort. 10.  Other Facts: The government conducted a Full and Open Competition for the initial agreement and Informix was selected for the DMLSS application because it provided the best value to the government.  Subsequently, the original company was purchased by IBM. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR TEAM  AND INDIVIDUAL COACHING.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to ANSWER the following QUESTIONS: RFQ -	NNL07184563Q1  QUESTIONS and ANSWERS Question: (1) Number of participants to be trained? Answer:       This is not a request for training.  It is for    	      leadership coaching. There are 12 individuals	  	      that require coaching. Question: (2)  Class size    Answer:        12 individuals that require coaching Question: (3)  Is the 182 hours of training per participant,  	       e.g., 40 hours of classroom training and 142  	       hours of coaching per participant? Answer:        The 182 hours is the total amount of coaching,  	       which includes coaching for 12 individuals and  	       Team Coaching sessions.	There is individual  	       coaching and team coaching.  There is no  	       classroom training being requested. Question:  (4) Is there a limit on the number of pages our  	       proposals can contain?	 Answer:        Limit to 10 pages Question:  (5) In the quote sheet, what does 'NSN =' and 'P/N ='  	       mean? Answer:        NSN -  National Supply Number -	P/N -  Part  	       Number  Question:  (6) In the quote sheet there is a field to enter   	       unit  price, but where do you enter the total  	       price? Answer:        You can put the total price under item 3 -  Item  	       3 is the Statement of Work for items 1  and 2. Questions: (7) Given that the government would like 182 hours of  	       coaching at the 75/25 percent ratio, do you  	       have in mind the length of the individual    	       sessions?  The length of the group sessions? Answer:        The individual coaching sessions shall be 1-hour  	       in length for each session.  The Team sessions  	       would be approximately 6 hours in length. Question:   (8) The description says 'The contractor shall   		provide leadership coaching for individual  		managers and team coaching for managers      		and their employees."  Is the offeror to    		assume that the team coaching will include more  		than just the managers? If so, how many    		employees do you anticipate to be in the team  		coaching? Answer: 	The Team coaching includes the lead manager and  		the managers that works for them. Question:   (9) Coaching usually involves a level of  		confidentiality.  With that said,what are the  		level of detail and the length of the reports  		you are asking for regarding the monthly reports  		on the individuals? Answer: 	We are looking for high level reports.	Is the  		individual showing up for the coaching?  Is  		progress being made, etc.  How many hours has  		each individual been coached? Question:   (10) Please clarify the sentence under  		 Deliverables:	"Written reports \     		 from coaches providing information of  		 individuals attendance in coaching weekly."  Do  		 you mean to say that individuals will be in  		 coaching weekly?  Or that you expect weekly  		 reports, in addition to the monthly reports?   		 Please clarify if you are looking for both   		 weekly and monthly reports detailing progress  		 and attendance.  Or just monthly reports  		 detailing progress and attendance. Answer: 	 We are looking for monthly reports.  The time  		 frame between coaching sessions should be  		 decided between the coach and the individual,  		 but should not exceed the number of hours  		 allocated for the individual. Question:  (11)  It is stated that: 'offerors will be evaluated  		 on a brief description of their approach to  		 meeting the requirement, their demonstrated   		 coaching experience .........".  How does the  		 government want this information submitted (via  		 additional documents or in the Comments  		 section of the web site) and how 'brief' is  		 it intended to be? Answer: 	 Additional documents or in the Comments  		 section, as long as it is submitted.  Brief. Question:  (12) Is this a new procurement?  If not who is/are  		the current holder(s)? Answer: 	This is a recompetition of a similar  		requirement.    Question:  (13) Please provide us a list of the organizations  		that requested copies of this RFP. Answer: 	Because this is an on-line RFQ, no  		one "requests" a copy of the RFQ from us - it's  		available to anyone on line - and because it's	 		available on-line, we do not have any idea of  		who is intending to participate. Question: (14) The requirement states that you expect 75%  	       individual coaching and 25% team.  Are there  	       constraints on how much time we can pull a group  	       away for team coaching (ex., can we do half or  	       full day sessions)? Answer:        The expectations approximately 6 hours a day. Questions: (15) The requirement also states that the coaching  		will be performed for technical managers, who  		have frequently been promoted from the  		technician workforce.  What is the range of  		managerial experience level for these  		individuals?  Ex, are they newly promoted  		managers, managers with 1-5 years of experience,  		senior managers with a great deal of experience,  		or all of the above?  Answer:	Managers with 1-5 years experience and senior  		managers. Question: (16)	What is expected on the "Required Delivery Date? Answer: 	All coaching hours will have been expended and  		all monthly progress reports will have been  		delivered throughout the year. Question: (17)	The initial coaching relationships were  		established in April 2005, and there was concern  		that introducing a new firm would cost  		government start up time and costs.  Is Pulse  		Point Coaching still being considered as a  		candidate for this procurement? Answer: 	All submissions will be considered. Question: (18) I have a question concerning  RFQ# NN07184563Q1  	       for Team and Individual Coaching for NASA Langley  	       Research Center.  In the on-line RFQ submittal  	       form, there are three price blocks to be  	       filled. Line item 1 is for the coaching, line  	      item 2 is for ODCs, but what  	      does line item 3 cover? Is it necessary to place a  	      cost in this box? Also, is it fair to assume that  	      a breakdown and explanation of these costs can be  	      attached as additional information? Answer:       Line item 3  is the Statement of Work for line  	      items 1-2.   It is not necessary to put a cost, or  	      you could put the total cost of line items 1-2.   	      The breakdown and explanation of these costs can  	      be attached as additional information. Question: (19) We are preparing a response for the Coaching  	       solicitation and I noticed in the   	       Data/Deliverables section the RFQ requests "  	       Written reports from coaches providing  	       information of individuals attendance in coaching  	       weekly."  Can you please clarify if the  	       expected number of individual coaching hours is  	       for weekly sessions or monthly sessions.  If it  	       is for monthly sessions do you want weekly  	       or monthly written reports? Answer:        We are looking for a report each month that  	       identifies the number of coaching hours an  	       individual has had during the month. Question: (20) We noticed the unit of price was JB.  I assume  	       that stands for job? Line item 1 - Are we quoting  	       a price for the coaching of each Technician    	       manager for the entire 12-month period? Answer:        Each manager will have a designated number of  	       hours they are to be coached.  This coaching must  	       be achieved over the 12-month period. Question: (21) Line item 2 - Travel and materials, is that  	       another total price for the 12-month period? Answer:        The amount of the travel and materials should be  	       what is needed during the 12-month period. Question: (22) Line item 3 - What exactly are we quoting for  	       here?  Would this be Our administrative/ 	       logistical fees, initial and mid-point meeting  	       times? Answer:        Line 3 is the Statement of Work, you do not have  	       to quote on this line item, or you can put the  	       total cost of line items 1 and 2 Question: 23) Can we add a separate attachment and not use the  	      slots provided as line items 1-3 for our pricing?   	      We will definitely add a sheet with a breakdown of  	      our prices, but would like to know if the total  	      had to be broken down as stated in line items 1, 2  	      and 3. Answer:       Yes Question: (24) We calculated approximately 12 individual  	       coaching sessions for each of the 12 technician  	       managers.  This leaves about 38 hours of team  	       coaching.  How many group sessions do you  	       anticipate having and how long would each session  	       be? Answer:        Approximately 2-3 team sessions for approximately  	       6 hours each. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on [ENTER DATE].

<DESC>The following question and answer were posed:

Q:  What is the likelihood that collections can be done at our two DC metro area clinics.  I am asking because under Collections Site 2. It states that only in unusual circumstances when a government facility does not meet the established collection site specifications, the DPC will arrange with the contractor for an outside collections site.  Under Collections 1. What resources are available to expedite drug testing for applicants located throughout the world?  Collection centers etc.

A:  We only refer pre-employment applicants to outside locations.  If an applicant is in another state, the contractor will have to provide an approved lab (approved by Health and Human Services) to perform the test.

<DESC>This amendment is for Questions and Answers. 1. With respect to the expander head, do you have any additional information concerning the vertical axis guidance support frame? Are there prints available for the product and/or components that are undergoing the vibration testing? The physical size and surfaces which would be guided by the support would be helpful. I assume these surfaces are on the expander head? The only drawings prints available are of the Unholtz Dickie T5000 CSTA configuration and approximate dimensions. Items tested are commercial and military equipment, generally one in. cube to 8 ft. cube dimensions. The guided surfaces are on the expander h ead. 2. Do you have additional detail on the configuration of the pneumatic load support, and its interface with the expander head and support system?    The load support operates under the expander head structure with the existing pneumatic support system to provide capability for adjustment of the test item position. The load support support connects directly to the expander head and frame.   3. Am I correct that both the (2) cargo fixtures and (2) head plate fixtures are AZ31B? Yes, the materal requirement is stated in paragraph 4 ( AZ31B material ).
