<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a renewal of Edison Welding Institute Membership and Friction Stir Weld License for a period of one year. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Edison Welding Institute, 1250 Arthur E. Adams Dr., Columbus, OH.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The EWI is a non-profit membership-based organization that provides metals joining expertise in the area of welding process selection, optimization, troubleshooting and research.  The EWI is the largest industrial consortium dedicated to welding in the United States with an estimated $9.0 Million annual applied research program dedicated to metals joining procedures and process development, which makes it the only source with the resources to address critical welding issues.  There are no other organizations in the U.S. offering these services.   2.  Membership in the EWI will enable NASA personnel to have direct access to a broad array of researchers and analysts with expertise in the welding of aerospace materials.  This expertise has been a direct benefit in the realm of NASA welding activities including, but not limited to: resolution of weld cracking in the Super Lightweight External Tank Program, continued microfissure elimination in the Space Shuttle Main Engine Program, the development of the friction stir weld process, and providing other welding support services to NASA and aerospace contractors.  In order for NASA to have access to this, it must pay EWI membership fee directly.  Membership is not available from any other source. 3.  The EWI's sister organization, The Welding Institute, Cambridge, U.K., holds all intellectual property rights to the friction stir welding process.  No other entity, worldwide, offers a similar welding process.  NASA is developing the FSW process for NASA programs.  In order for NASA to use this process, it must obtain a license directly from EWI.  The license is not available from any other source.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 22, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Moya, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 202-220-5407, Fax 202-220-5711, Email elizabeth.moya@csosa.gov
<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for a planned Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract in support of security system requirements for Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, CSOSA.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in, and on behalf of, the District of Columbia. Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities. In executing this mission, CSOSA operates from leased spaces throughout the District of Columbia. 

The IDIQ-type contract is intended to provide for quick, cost-effective responses to Agency requirements for installation of new, and repair & maintenance of existing, security systems and/or security system components at various CSOSA sites in the District of Columbia.  The successful contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, and material to install and repair access control security systems, accompanying equipment and associated system components on a firm, fixed price Task Order basis.  All work shall be performed in accordance with the contract specifications and Task Order-specific technical requirements.  Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of security systems and an understanding of Federal agency security requirements, including unique CSOSA security requirements.  Schedules for performance will be negotiated on a Task Order basis, however, contractors may be required to meet compressed schedules to deal with emergency or urgent requirements.

Under the planned contract, all installed systems, accompanying equipment and associated system components must be compatible with the present CSOSA legacy systems such as WINPAK 2.0 (release 3), PELCO systems (in order to control access), RADIONICS, as well as function with the existing proximity card-making system, and CCTV system.  The Contractor shall be responsible for properly interfacing all system components, including required connectivity to 633 Indiana Avenue NW, Washington DC.  An interface requires not only a physical connection, but also a matching of signals with regard to impedance, signal level, timing, synchronization and termination. The Contractor shall coordinate all installation and testing of systems and/or system components with CSOSA Security staff. The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one-year warranty agreement on all new systems and / or system components.  The Contractor shall also provide on-site service and repair within 24 hours of notice should new system components fail during the one-year warranty period.  Any perimeter device that fails during the one-year warranty period shall have same business day response.  The Contractor shall respond to all COTR requests for Emergency Service 100% of the time during the period of performance, with definitization to occur after performance.

The IDIQ-type contract will consist of a one-year base and four (4) one-year option periods.  The estimated dollar value is $50,000 for the base and for each of the option periods (total estimated contract value of $250,000).  The minimum Task Order limit under this contract is $2,500 and the maximum is $150,000.  The minimum guaranteed funding for the base and each of the option periods is $5,000, which may be met through the award of a task order.  The Government is not obligated to exercise any of the option periods, but reserves the right to do so on unilateral basis.  The Government also reserves the right to exercise option periods early in the event contract capacity is reached prior to any 12 month period of performance.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement shall be issued on or about the 30th of August 2005.  FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures shall be utilized for the award of the planned contract, using a Trade-off between technical and price.  Technical evaluation criteria are weighted in following, descending order of importance: Technical Approach (40%), Personnel Qualifications (35%) and Past Performance (25%).  The technical evaluation criteria, when combined, are equal to price. The closer overall technical ratings are to one another based on evaluation of the offers received, the greater will be the importance of the price proposals in making an award determination.  To be highly rated, firms shall demonstrate adequacy in approach, qualifications and past performance to establish their proposal will provide maximum benefit to the Government. The Government reserves the right to independently verify contractor past performance. The Request For Proposal will be available ONLY on the Internet at the FedBizzOpps website: http://www.eps.gov  Telephone, written or e-mail requests for a hardcopy of the solicitation will not be accepted.

This is an unrestricted procurement; it is open to both large and small businesses.  Therefore, all responsible sources may respond to the Request for Proposal, once issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561621, Security Systems. The small business size standard is $10.5 Million average annual gross revenue over the last three completed fiscal years.  If a large business firm is selected for award, the firm will be required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award. The subcontracting plan shall identify goals for Small Business (SB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Veteran-owned Small Business (VOSB) concerns. The required subcontracting plan from large business will be based on the aggregate pricing from the successful firm.  Any planned subcontracting should support the mandatory Agency subcontracting goals of 23 percent for small businesses, with 5 percent for both women-owned and small disadvantaged businesses and 3 percent for HUBZone businesses.  The Service Contract Act applies to this requirement.  Firms must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive contract award. To register, visit the CCR website at: http:// www. ccr. gov

<SUBJECT>70--The National Park Service intends to negotiate a Sole source for follow-on type contract for the continued development of a database tool.  Original developers of two independent tools are joining together to produce an integrated product.
<SOLNBR>A9560050048
<RESPDATE>122705
<ARCHDATE>12162006
<CONTACT>Del McCann Contracting Officer 3039876738     Del_McCann@nps.gov;
<DESC>This project seeks to integrate two complementary database tools that were produced by the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service for related purposes.  It will utilize the strengths of each tool, resulting in an easy-to-use fire ecology and fire effects monitoring system that has direct-to-digital (via PDA) data collection, GIS data management and analysis capabilities, and standardized analysis and reporting capabilities.  Limited additional functionality will be added to the integrated tool.  The tool shall provide a single software application to reduce the costs for software training, maintenance and support. The solution shall demonstrate functional modularity, such that additional application features can be phased-in as needed (i.e., extensibility, scalability, reliability, performance), and how the solution will work in a multi-bureau environment.   A standalone desktop database tool that can be placed and worked on in a network server-only environment is anticipated.  Multi user access to the system is a requirement for all FFI functions.    Other technology such as a web portal would not be discouraged if it provided for full off line capabilities.  The successful Vendor must demonstrate their solution for a variety of users.  Any Vendor suggesting a cross bureau single server solution will need to discuss additional requirements within their contract proposal.  Things to be considered are system reliability, availability, system performance, security, password management, capacity, data retention, backup, contingency, communications and connectivity issues. The original developers of FIREMON and FEAT have agreed to work together on this project.   Therefore, SEM brings their extensive knowledge of FIREMON and their user community and Spatial Dynamics does the same for FEAT.  No other contractors can bring together this level of skills through collaboration; these are the original developers of these two unique database tools. - The work requires expert knowledge of monitoring protocols used by federal agencies, specifically for fire effects, and the proposed contractor has demonstrated expert knowledge of the users needs in these areas. - While the Government owns the custom software developed by SEM for FIREMON, and Spatial for FEAT, it is not reasonable to expect a third-party contractor to be able to maintain or enhance this customized software in an efficient, timely, or cost-effective manner without the previous experience in developing these tools. - Without experience and skill with developing existing products and the strong understanding of user expectations that the contractors have from creating FEAT and FIREMON it is unreasonable to expect a third-part contractor to develop and test the integrated tool and deliver a useable product. Spatial Dynamics has been the sole developer of NPS Fire Ecology Assessment Tool (FEAT) and SEM the developer of FIREMON.  Both of these tools are sophisticated software programs and at this point it would take a substantial amount of time for a new contractor just to understand the architecture of FEAT and FIREMON and the design for the Intergration.  Moreover, a new contractor would also need to invest significant time and energy to develop a comparable understanding of the business needs of the DOI and USFS that SEM and Spatial Dynamics currently have.  In order to capitalize on the investment that NPS and USFS have made in FIREMON and FEAT we need to continue the strong working relation that we have established with SEM and Spatial Dynamics when developing FIREMON and FEAT; switching to a different contractor could effectively halt the development of FFI. Any firm that believes it can furnish the items described above is encouraged to give written notifciation to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements in a timely and cost efficient way.  All responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competative procurement.  Inquireies will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 987-6675, Attn:  Dell McCann, Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's business size.

<DESC>This project is located in Meade County, 6 miles south of Sturgis, South Dakota.  Previous treatment on this project included whole tree yarded commercial removal and pre-commercial thinning.  The pre-commercial thinning was then hand piled in a subsequent contract.  The project consists of 257 acres and is located primarily in Township 004N, Range 005E, Sections 4, 5, 8, and 9; Township 005N, Range 005E Section 33.  The primary objective of this contract is to remove created hand piles by disposing of piles on site.  Chipping, mulching, or masticating hand piles was selected because the lack of snow in this area makes removal of piles by burning difficult to achieve. Numbered Notes:  1

The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $4,000,000 to $6,000,000, with an anticipated project duration of approximately 480 calendar days.

The project scope consists of upgrades to the existing curtain wall system (renovation/ replacement of the existing system) of the Harold Washington Social Security Center.  The Scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Pre-construction phase services with the construction phase services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option.  This will be a firm fixed price contract.  A firm, fixed price for the general construction services will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction phase option.

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and source selection procedures using the Best Value trade-off process.  All elements of work to be executed must be within congressionally mandated cost limitations.

<DESC>Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, the General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture and is seeking an Architect-Engineering (A-E) design team for the construction for a new FBI Agency Campus to be located on 11000 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA. 
SCOPE OF WORK
The new construction includes mid-rise buildings for office and storage space; a special maintenance facility and parking structures located in the southwest corner within the existing 28-acre Government site in west Los Angeles bounded by I-405 and Wilshire Boulevard.  These buildings will be located within the existing campus of a 1970’s international-style18-story Federal Building.
These new buildings will be built in two project phases, Project Phase I and Project Phase II.  Upon project completion of Project Phase I, the Agency will have approximately 228,000 gsf of office space, 190,000 gsf of library-style storage, a 47,000 Automotive Radio Maintenance Facility (AMRF), secured parking for 800 cars in addition to the existing 600-vehicle parking structure, and a secure barrier around the campus to meet current security standards.  Upon completion of Project Phase II, the Agency will have an additional 472,000 of office space and secured parking for 400 cars.
These new facilities shall conform to the latest building codes, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements including blast mitigation and progressive collapse mitigation, utility systems, fire safety, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS).

The estimated total construction cost for Project Phase I is between $140,000,000 and $160,000,000.  The overall design and construction project will have a contract completion period of approximately five years.  Project Phase II is planned to follow immediately after Project Phase I.

The Firm Fixed Price base A/E Services contract will include Pre-Design, Preliminary Concepts, and Final Concept phases for both Project Phase I and II.  At the end of the Base Contract, the Government will determine the procurement method, (i.e. traditional design/bid/build, bridging design/build, etc.) based upon economic times and funding conditions.


The Government reserves the right to exercise additional work as options.  The scope of the A-E Services under this Firm-Fixed Price Contract may include as options for Project Phase I only but is not limited to the following: Pre-design services including special studies, surveys, site investigation, schematics design, design development, preparation of working drawings and contract documents to be completed in AUTOCAD, specifications, estimating services, value engineering, post-construction award services and other supplemental services as appropriate to the project needs.  
A/E firms are advised that at least 51% of the level of contract effort for Project Phase I must be performed in the State of California.  The A/E firm will address the contractual relationship with the lead designer and project team in Stage 2.
SELECTION PROCESS
The Selection is comprised of two stages as follows:
Stage 1: This stage will establish the Design Excellence capability of the lead designer and the associated A-E design firm.  The lead designer is the individual or team of designers who will have primary responsibility for the project design. The A/E Firm referred to in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The lead designer will also be involved in commissioning an artist or artists for this project and in assisting with the successful integration of works of arts into the architectural design.  Additionally, the lead designer must be an employee of the A/E firm.  In this first stage, a minimum of three lead designers and their associated A-E firms will be “shortlisted” based upon the submittals in response to this Request for Qualification (RFQ).  
Identification of team members, other than the Lead Designer(s),is not required at this stage. Consultant and “production firm” (if different from the Design Firm) information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio.
All submissions will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format. The assembled content for the Stage I portfolio should be no more than 1/4 inch thick. Pages may be double-sided where feasible. The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II (dated not earlier than 12 months earlier than this announcement), and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions. Qualifications submitted will be reviewed and evaluated based on the evaluation criteria listed below.  
1)	Past Performance on Design (35%): The A-E design firm shall submit a portfolio of three completed comparable projects by the firm within the past ten years; include a maximum of two pages per project describing design objectives, approach, results, project significance, key features, awards and up to three illustrations (no larger 8x10 inches each) for each project to indicate visual evidence of design quality.  The narrative shall discuss how the client’s design, economic and operational objectives were satisfied by the design.  It should comment on the relevance of submitted projects to this project.  This section of the submission should include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence, and provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, email, phone, and fax numbers. A representative floor plan, a site plan, a building section, or other appropriate drawing should be included.
2)	Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the lead designer’s words, the submission shall include a statement (maximum of two pages) indicating overall design philosophy, understanding of design issues, and approaches and solutions specific to new construction including strategies for addressing integrated and sustainable design. 
3)	Lead Designers(s) Portfolio (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the lead designer’s ability to provide design excellence. Address his or her participation in each project. If a single designer, submit a portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). If the lead designer is a team, submit graphics and a description of up to two projects from each lead designer or lead design discipline. The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operations and maintenance objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. Include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence. Where there is duplication with criteria (1) Past Performance on Design, the lead designer shall address his or her participation in the project. 
4)	Lead Designer(s) Profile(s) (15%): Submit biographical sketch(es) including education, professional experience, and recognition for design efforts for similar projects for the lead designer(s); identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.  One of the goals of this project is to develop an award-winning quality design that meets the project’s programming and budget parameters.  In addition, appropriate and cost-effective integration of sustainable design principles will be required.  Formal LEED certification as outlined by U.S. Green Building is required.  LEED 2.0 (or most current) criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project.  Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence, the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated.
Stage 2:  In this stage, the entire project team for each A-E design firm selected in Stage 1 including the designated lead designer, design principal (if different), project manager, and consultants who will work on this project will be evaluated.  The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the lead designer and project team in Stage II.  The short listed A-E design firms will submit Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications for the entire project team for this stage of the selection process.  Sufficient time (30-days) will be provided to the A-E design firms to establish project teams.  Information shall be provided outlining how to describe the team’s capabilities and accomplishments with an emphasis on the projects that the team has collaborated on previously.  .
Consideration for selection will be based on the following criteria:
1)	Proposed Project Team:  Key personnel background and qualifications including previous relevant experience.
2)	Project Management:  Proposed project planning, scheduling, team coordination, cost control methods, quality control methods and production facilities.
3)	Design Experience:  Visual and narrative evidence of the proposed team’s design capability with respect to new construction.
The Government will establish the date these Stage 2 submittals are due and provide selection criteria for the interviews and final selection process in conjunction with the Stage 1 shortlist announcement.
In Stage 2, A joint venture and/or a firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of members to provide a quality effort.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.

Additionally, the modified/new system will stay within existing size, weight, and power restrictions without changes to the existing airframe.  Ammunition loading in austere locations/environments including Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP) and shipboard environments is required.  This change will be incorporated into the AH-1W and reused when the AH-1W is remanufactured into the AH-1Z.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for the furtherance of a Phase II Research and Development (R&D) study through the acquisition of: Spinning Slosh Test Rig (SSTR) Drive Assembly Dynamometer Redesign and Fabrication; Eddy Current Testing, and; Extended Lateral Fuel Slosh Testing.  These proposed action items will be a follow-on effort to an on-going study entitled, “Centerline Generic Nutation Study, Phase II” (NASA Contract No. NNK05LA81P).   Phase 1 consisted of design and analysis tasks dealing with the creation of a test tank and the modification of the SSTR to accommodate centerline mounted tank investigations.   Phase 2 required the final design and manufacture of a generic test tank and the modification of the SSTR to ultimately allow data collection for centerline-mounted tank configurations. Additional work under Phase 2 will require: 1 – The redesign and fabrication of a dynamometer assembly that enhances the Generic Centerline Study test data by minimizing large unwanted force signals that cannot be repeatedly offset during system calibration. 2 – The safe and proper performance of eddy current Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) testing on the SSTR drive assembly tube steel at all forty (40) thru-hole locations. As part of the contract completion process, a report detailing the inspection activities will ultimately be submitted to the Government.  3 - The development of a new lateral slosh and natural frequency test---to be added to the data collected under the existing Centerline Generic Nutation Study contract (NNK05LA81P)---in order to extend the results and techniques of current testing to future Delta II missions by expanding the present test matrix. The functional purpose of these tests will be to define the one-g lateral slosh parameters and to identify the one-g natural frequencies of spacecraft fuel tanks. That is to say, the resulting test data will be collected and evaluated to help validate any analytical technique that relates the lateral loading sloshing affects of hydrazine fuel on spacecraft performance. The test articles to be used for this test are the test tank, diaphragm and dynamometer developed for the STEREO mission. NASA/KSC intends to purchase these professional services from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, TX  78238, Email: sgreen@swri.org; Web: http://www.swri.com This sole source procurement is entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	  SwRI has the unique expertise as the design agency and developer of the SSTR to successfully implement the described tasks. SwRI generated the design concept for the SSTR, built the SSTR, and has performed all of the required strength and failure modes and effects analyses to support the operation of the SSTR. SwRI has successfully used the SSTR to generate critical data in support of three NASA expendable launch vehicle missions; GENESIS, CONTOUR, and STEREO. The NASA-owned SSTR that SwRI developed, built and tested is the only one of its kind in the aerospace industry. Due to the uniqueness of the SSTR, it is the only existing hardware that can meet the requirements of this task, and SwRI has unique expertise to perform the test and analysis. Previous research was performed during the concept study phase of building a spin test facility, and SwRI was determined to be the only organization that could meet the technical and schedule requirements in support of the GENESIS mission. With the hardware built, tested and operated in support of two NASA missions, it is obvious the SSTR is the only asset that can satisfy the requirements of this task. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item/service using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 22, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Offers may be emailed to:  Justice.K.Harvey@nasa.gov by the time and date set for closing (12/22/2005 not later than 4:30 p.m.).	 An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and (b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.

SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 3.

For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This research effort is a result of a solicited proposal from the FBKFF Project being conducted within the Fusion and Technologies Branch, AMSRD-CER-IW-FF at I2WD Fort Monmouth, NJ to the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA Computer Science Department  to build upon the initial proof-of-concept investigation of applicability of advanced blackboard and multi-agent system (MAS) techniques for creating a collaborative information-fusion environment for Army analysts and decision makers within the Armys Br igade Combat Teams.  Under the existing contract, the contractor conducts R&D to advance the scientific foundations in the problem domain, and to develop and enhance software that will increase the speed and accuracy of intelligence analysis in support of answering commanders PIRs under severe information overload and challenging time constraints for making tactical decisions.  The contractor is required to:  illuminate a number of the key sources of complexity underpinning the problem of answering PIRs; i ncorporate the development of new algorithms and computational representations in a highly flexible and responsive software architecture; demonstrate speed and accuracy improvements  in answering PIRs with respect to the identified sources of complexity in  the context of government-furnished scenarios and data sets; and to document the results, approach, rationale, interpretations and conclusions in a Final Scientific and Technical Report.   The software developed will be delivered to the government in a wo rking prototype system. Technical Point of Contact is Dr. Gerald Powell (732)-532-2429. Contractual Point of Contact is Andrew Dellomo (732)-532-3569. Reference Note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise a paragraph in the BAA.

1.  Section I. INTRODUCTION, paragraph three, in the BAA, is revised to read as follows:

The FY06 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is focused on developing medical counter-measures to emerging threats, genetically engineered and nontraditional toxins, virulence factors and microorganisms as biological warfare (BW) threat agents.  An important consideration is a more expedient approach and/or a shorter timeline to advanced development for a potential product.  It is anticipated that these counter-measures would include, rapid resequencing,  pre-treatments (excluding vaccines), therapeutics and basic science to characterize the nature of the threat and identify key targets for intervention or disruption of these agents.  The agent classes that are to be focused on are: intra-cellular bacterial pathogens and hemorrhagic fever viruses.

Work disciplines include conventional and specialized machining processes inclusive of, but not limited to:  milling, turning, boring, electrical discharge machining, drilling, fitting, polishing, sanding, filling and sawing, precision grinding, precision lapping, metal finishing, precision assembly and integration of systems, numerically controlled wire electrical discharge machining, numerically controlled turning, numerically controlled milling, numerically controlled high-speed milling, and CAD/CAM programming.  The service provider shall be capable of performing precision machining of hardware to tolerances as accurate as +/-.002 inches on contoured surfaces and produce surface finishes as low as 2 rms (micro inches).  Other dimensional requirements may require accuracy to within .0002 inches.  The service provider shall have expertise in the application and machining of a full range of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other materials that are common to the aerospace industry.  Materials most frequently used for these activities are 15-5 PH stainless steel, Vascomax and aluminum alloys.   Some end items will require the service provider to collaborate with NASA research scientists and engineers to enable the concurrent design and development of research hardware. All qualified firms, both large and small, are encouraged to respond.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this procurement is 33641, and the size standard under this code is 1,000 employees. Firms having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement documenting their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  It is required that responses be limited to 7 pages.	Responses should be comprehensive and specific in describing experience related to the requirements specified above.  For example, responses should describe experience in:  metallic test article development, listing types of models or other hardware produced; general and precision machining, listing types of service performed or product delivered; producing flight hardware, working with specified materials, and meeting stringent tolerances as listed above.

Responses should indicate affiliate information, parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if respondent is a potential subcontractor) or subcontractors (if respondent is a potential prime). No solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

The EPA envisions a fixed rate structure for each BPA with line items for  each area of expertise and associated fixed hourly rates for each line item.   The government may make multiple awards for each area of expertise. A vendor does not need to be able to provide all the aforementioned services in order to be eligible for award of one or more line items.   To  determine if there should be small business set asides for any of the line items, the EPA will post a sources sought notice.

In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Fabrizio Previdi, Via Cremagnani #16, Vimercate, Italy for continued development of the Environmental and Genetic Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study for a one year base period with one, one year option period.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the US. Improved insight into the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer may mitigate one of the greatest public health problems of our time. The cause of the large majority of lung cancers is tobacco; however, the precise molecular mechanism of smoking carcinogenesis is poorly understood. The GEB has a large population-based case-control study of lung cancer, the Environmental And Genetic Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, which explores the genetic determinants of lung cancer and smoking. Cases enrollment is conducted in Italy, within thirteen hospitals of the Lombardy Region. Controls are enrolled from the general population of the same catchment’s area of the cases. The study includes over 4,000 individuals and collects questionnaire data, clinical forms, measures of exposures, and blood and tissue specimens from each subject. Genetics analyses, including polymorphisms in candidate genes, expression arrays, proteomics and whole genome analyses. The follow-up of the lung cancer cases to collect data on therapy efficacy, toxicity, recurrence of the disease, and survival after the first diagnosis is planned. Thus, there are several thousands variables per subject to analyze. The EAGLE study has a complex relational database (SQL server) that was built for data storage and analyses that the NCI Principle Investigators have access to via the internet.  This is a continuation of an on-going project and Dr. Fabrizio Previdi is uniquely qualified to continue to perform the required service for the EAGLE project which he has been collaborating on since 2001.   Dr. Previdi, an expert in computer science specializes in field activities management and database design for large studies and created the EAGLE database and has a unique knowledge of the tables, coding procedures, internal quality checks, server connections, and internet transmission of the EAGLE data.   Dr. Previdi has expertise in the practical aspects involved in the collection of epidemiological data, clinical charts, informed consent forms, and biospecimens, according to NCI standards and needs, and has access to all epidemiological and clinical data from the hospitals involved in the EAGLE study.  Dr. Fabrizio Previdi is the only known source to the NCI researcher with the knowledge and expertise who can meet their needs.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.     All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on December 22, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed to (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>DESC:  MARKET SURVEY -  SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR AUTOMATED CONSTITUENT SERVICES SYSTEM (CSS).  The purpose of this sources sought notice is solely to gain knowledge of potential qualified industry sources with a commercial off-the-shelf automated constituent services system that will meet the stated requirements for use in United States Senate Member offices.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the United States Senate to an award of a contract.  This sources sought notice contains the most currently available information.  This information is subject to change at any time.  Responses will be used by the United States Senate to make appropriate acquisition decisions - see submittal requirements below. 

The United States Senate, Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA) is responsible for managing the acquisition, implementation, maintenance and operation of information technology for Senate offices.  Principal among the needs of Member offices is an automated system for managing services provided to constituents.

The SAA is initiating a project to select vendors with commercially available products or systems able to meet the functional and operational requirements for such a system.  The general requirements are as follows:

Functional
The system must be able to receive and record communications from constituents (individuals and groups) via postal mail, electronic mail (e-mail), facsimile and other methods including notes of oral communications via telephone and person-to-person. 

The system must track all communications (both incoming and outgoing) in a client-manageable database with the ability to: report on status, route communications within offices, and maintain accurate records of constituent data (names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc.).

The system will integrate the creation of responses (outgoing communications) inside the system to allow for easy distribution of responses to one or many constituents via postal mail, e-mail or other electronic and non-electronic distribution methods.

The system will maintain an archive of all communications received and distributed by offices.  Office will be able to search and retrieve information from the archive as needed to respond to constituent requests for information and services as well as to track issues and trends.

The system will format and deliver correspondence to local office printers that communicate with Microsoft compatible operating systems (Windows 2000 and higher).  The system will also format and deliver correspondence to high speed printers as typically found in federal government printing facilities.

Operational

The current Senate office environment primarily uses desktop operating systems from Microsoft Corporation (Windows 2000 and higher), and also has systems with Apple Macintosh operating systems.  The SAA supports server environments using Windows 2000 and higher.  The standard communications platform is built on Microsoft Exchange with some application of Active Directory. Proposed CSS applications must perform and interoperate with standard applications within this environment.

Systems must provide for local (Washington, DC offices) and remote (Senators’ state offices) operation of the CSS.  Each Senator averages four state offices for constituent support, with access through a wide area network which has circuit speeds from 56 Kbps up to full T-1 speed (depending on office size) to servers in the respective Senator’s Washington, DC, office.

Systems must provide security of operations based on role.  Such role based-access will govern access to and operations on data based on the individual’s role and level of authority.

Vendors will be required to provide installation, maintenance, training, help desk support and documentation.  Vendors may also need to provide data transition services to capture existing data into newly installed systems.

Vendor responses should demonstrate the capability of the described products or systems to meet the general functional and operational requirements outlined above in a method other than a simple affirmative declaration. Respondents to this sources sought may be invited to demonstrate the capabilities of their respective products or systems in a laboratory environment in the Washington, DC area.

INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this Market Survey-Sources Sought request are due to the POC no later than January 16, 2006 at 12:00 Noon ET and shall be submitted electronically via email only to the attention of Jill T. Johnson at acquisitions@saa.senate.gov.  The subject line of the email message shall be SSN 2006-S-010 Automated Constituent Services System (CSS).  No other method of transmittal will be accepted.  The response shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages.  Pages over the page limitation may be discarded.  Access by the SAA to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party.  Neither the SAA nor the Senate is responsible for any failure to access vendor’s information.  The information supplied in response to this sources sought notice will be used to qualify firms, which may then be invited to demonstrate the capabilities of their respective products and systems.  Vendors responding to this sources sought notice and deemed qualified by the SAA may be requested to submit a proposal in response to a solicitation.  Only firms deemed qualified will be permitted to submit proposals.  If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the SAA anticipates release of a solicitation in March 2006.  Neither the SAA nor the Senate will be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this request.     

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SAA OR SENATE.  ANY TELEPHONE OR E-MAIL REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being released by the General Services Administration (GSA) on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and Access Card Office (ACO), collectively, the “Requestor”.  This RFI is being issued for planning purposes and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Requestor to acquire any products or services.  If an RFP is issued, it will be officially issued by the appropriate government contracting office.  The Requestor does not intend to pay for the information requested.  All information provided is for government planning use only.  If proprietary information is provided, please mark as “Proprietary for Government Use Only”.

Purpose
The purpose of this RFI is to request comments from handheld computing manufacturers and designers about existing products, planned products, or feasible designs for a portable rugged Windows CE handheld that can meet the needs of various DoD, federal, state, and local government programs.  Although it would be preferable to find vendors who have existing products that meet all the requirements, it is understood that vendors will need to customize their devices or design completely new devices to fully meet the specification.  It is thus equally important that product roadmaps are submitted along with the vendor’s products’ technical specifications, which will be used to identify vendors that have plans consistent with the Requestor’s requirements.  Qualified sources may be asked to present their product and/or roadmap with key government planners and decision makers.  This process is designed to assist the government in determining how to best draft any possible future RFP.

Background
The proposed device is targeted at several government programs, including but not limited to DMDC’s Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS), DMDC’s Noncombatant Evacuation Operation Tracking System (NTS), Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) National Capital Region First Responders Program, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  These devices are to be deployed in harsh environments typical of military and first responder field use.  The primary driver for this RFI is the pending issuance of a standardized Federal Government Identity Credential as per Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS-201).  Several existing programs which are managed by the Requestor are in the process of being modified to support this new Identity Credential.  The primary feature in the new devices is the ability to read the new FIPS-201 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Identity Credential.  In addition, the Requestor would like to enhance certain features within its programs and add new programs which can utilize a handheld computing device.  And finally, during the requirements gathering process, it was found that there exist several other complementary applications for the Requestor and its affiliates.  These complimentary applications have hardware requirements which overlap substantially with the government programs listed above.  Examples of the complimentary applications include physical security, incident command, victim management, hazardous sample management and resource tracking.  These applications share a common hardware feature set and therefore are included in the RFI requirements specification.

Requirements Specification
The attached Handheld Requirements (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) have been generated by compiling the requirements from several government agencies with active programs utilizing handheld computing devices.  Requirements that are shared across all agencies have been separated into their own tab in the spreadsheet, labeled “Common Requirements”.  Each group’s specific requirements are listed in separate tabs of the spreadsheet, labeled “Group 1”, “Group 2”, etc.  Additionally, each requirement has a “Yes/No” attribute indicating whether it is a mandatory requirement.

The Requestor would like to receive the following information from prospective manufacturers or product distributors:

1)	Minimum acceptable response from vendor:  Information regarding the characteristics/technical specifications of their handheld products
2)	Preferred response from vendor:  Add a column for each product and mark features as either “Yes, No, Available with Customization (AWC), or Future” in all tabs of the attached Requirements Specification spreadsheet (Note: If answer is “Future” or “AWC”, please indicate expected time to deliver feature).
3)	Expected changes that are anticipated in next generation products and/or product roadmaps out as far as developed
4)	The month and year the products are expected to be available
5)	The estimated product production and End Of Life timeframes planned
6)	Number of years the supplier has been in business
7)	Please indicate if you would be willing to travel to the Washington, DC area to present your response to this RFI within a month or two of the RFI Response Date.


The Requestor would like the following information from prospective designers:

1)	Description of design work (i.e., specify what type of design such as PCB, case, etc.; specify if any off-the-shelf components will be utilized)
2)	Estimate of development time
3)	Mark features that will be fulfilled in the attached Requirements Specification spreadsheet
4)	Number of years company has been in business
5)	Please indicate if you would be willing to travel to the Washington, DC area to present your response to this RFI.

Note that the Requestor presents this plan to promote competition and provide fair access to all handheld vendors.  However, the government reserves the right to adjust this plan based upon programmatic and operational need.  All products in the vendor’s response must be compliant with Trade Act Agreement (TAA) requirements in order to meet DoD procurement regulations.  The Government may request meetings with the candidates to provide more in depth technical briefings as necessary to complete the survey.

Questions regarding this RFI should be addressed via e-mail to Matt.Sanders@gsa.gov no later than 5 January 2006.  

Interested parties shall submit their response via e-mail to Matt.Sanders@gsa.gov no later than 18 January 2006.  Responses should be sent in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and/or .pdf file formats.  ALL inquiries and responses must be submitted by email - Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>SYSNOPSIS:  TCDLS FOR NAVAL BATTLEFORCE NETWORKS-AIRBORNE COMMS PACKAGE
<DESC>TACTICAL COMMON DATA LINK FOR NAVAL BATTLEFORCE NETWORKS â€“ AIRBORNE COMMUNICATIONS PACKAGE SYNOPSIS The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSYCEN), San Diego intends to solicit and award a Firm Fixed Price type contract to L-3 Communications Corporation (Communication Systems â€“ West) 640 N 2200 W P.O. Box 16850 Salt Lake City, UT 84116-0850 on a sole source basis to provide four (4) Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) terminals that are compatible with hardware previously developed by L-3 under an Office of Naval Research (ONR) contract.  The TCDL terminals procured under this action will be used to exercise and demonstrate existing Naval Battleforce Networks â€“ Airborne Communications Package (NBN-ACP) hardware. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Authority for Other-Than-Full and Open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Based on previous research and development efforts performed for SSC SD, the government has determined that L-3 Communications Systems - West is the only concern that can deliver these radios.  The use of any other source for this acquisition would result in the duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractor's workforce, which would result in substantial added cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Additionally, the existing L-3 NBN-ACP proprietary hardware would need to be replaced or reconfigured to interface with another contractorâ€™s radios, which would add significant program costs and delay reaching program milestones.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334220; the size standard is 750 employees.  The anticipated delivery date is 31 March 2006, with a total estimated value of less than seven hundred thousand dollars. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to LCDR Patrick Ingram, SC, USN at pat.ingram@navy.mil.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW, the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Price Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-06 & DFARS change notice (DCN) 20051209.

Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3728, FSC code is 1630& the size standard is 1000 employees. NAICS is 336413.


The Air Force Flight Test Center has a requirement for Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly.  The assembly consists of the items as listed:  30 each - P/N 140-285, Wheel Speed Transducer, and 30 each – P/N 140-28530, Hubcap.  The function of the entire assembly is to sense wheel speed at landing to prevent skid on a runway by communicating with an on-board control unit that monitors brake application pressure.  Other salient characteristics are described below:

Two wheel-speed transducers provide individual wheel velocity measurement for each of the braked wheels. The transducers have axle adapters to allow them to be mounted inside the axles.  The transducer-adapter assembly is secured by threaded fasteners protruding through the axle and castellated wheel axle nuts.  The transducer shaft extends from the transducer toward the hubcap.  On the shaft, a drive coupling is installed, which is driven by the hubcap drive mechanism.  The field-proven hubcap-transducer drive interface is of sufficient rotational stiffness and strength to prevent transmission of erroneous wheel-speed velocity signals.  The coupling design can accommodate angular and parallel misalignment and axial assembly tolerance without degradation such as premature bearing or drive coupling wear.  The transducer is a variable reluctance alternator with 36 poles (teeth) on the rotor with 36 matching poles (teeth) on the stator.  The magnetic field is provided by a coaxial coil energized by the control unit transducer bias current.  With the excitation applied, a static magnetic field is established between the north and south poles of the rotor, air gap, stator and return path iron of the transducer, and no output is produced.  As the wheel rotates, rotor teeth pass the stator slots and teeth, causing variations in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, which causes a change in the flux linking the coil.  The transducer output is, therefore, a sinusoidally varying voltage, with a frequency directly proportional to wheel rotational velocity.

Transducer Weight:  The weight of the wheel-speed transducer is 1.1 pounds.  The weight will be further defined after final axle adapter design.  The transducer weight does not include the weight of the hubcap, which is included in the total system weight estimate.  The proposed wheel-speed transducer is similar to Hydro-Aire 36-tooth wheel-speed transducers used on numerous commercial, business and military aircraft.
See attached specifications for clarification. 

Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required equipment.  FOB Destination is the Government preferred method of shipping. Please submit FOB Destination shipping information with all submittals to the office. Delivery Schedule:  Five months ARO. Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
