<SUBJECT>R -- Support  Added  Value Enterprises (SAVE) Activity, Phase II
<SOLNBR>114-02-008
<CONTACT>Gary Kinney, Regional Contracting Officer, Phone +995-32-77-85-40, Fax 995-32-00-14-33 (RCO)/+995-32-00-10-13++, Email gkinney@usaid.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is issued to inform of USAID's intent to issue an option to ACDI/VOCA to implement Phase II of the SAVE activity.

On December 12, 2001, USAID/Caucasus issued Request for Proposals (RFP) No.  114-02-008 for the Support Added Value Enterprises Activity to award a contract pursuant to full and open competition.  That document set forth the periods of performance for Phase I and Phase II of a "design and build" type of contract (more accurately, perhaps, "design and implement") to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of Georgian agribusiness enterprises.  The RFP set forth USAID's intention of awarding the contract in two distinct phases.  As stated in the RFP, "The second phase will be for approximately forty two months and will concentrate on the implementation of activities identified in Phase I to remove constraints to the growth and development of the agricultural sector, added-value processing and exports."  The RFP contained technical evaluation criteria that evaluated both the Phase I, and Phase II approach.  ACDI/VOCA was awarded a contract in the amount of $2,173,332 for Phase I and USAID was to consider the inauguration of the second or option phase dependent upon the satisfaction of several conditions of the statement of work.  USAID is now satisfied that all conditions have been met and intends to enter into Phase II of this contract with ACDI/VOCA without further competition. 

USAID believes that cost negotiations with ACDI/VOCA can be easily achieved for Phase II and there is sufficient information to confirm that costs will be fair and reasonable.  This synopsis is not a request for the submission of proposals and, thus, no RFP exists. This synopsis is published by way of information only in accordance with Numbered Note 22 and specific USAID authorities to carry out this transaction.  The content of this note is contained below.

Note 22.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center is soliciting proposals from interested academic medical centers to develop and evaluate, a National Center of Excellence (CoE) in Womens Health, a national model program to advance womens health care.  The CoE model includes a comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated program in five key areas:  clinical care, research, community outreach, professional education, and the retention and promotion of womens faculty.  Funds are provided by the Office on Womens Health to be used to coordinate and leverage resources to accomplish program goals.  The Government anticipates making up to three awards to be effective September 30, 2003.  The period of performance shall be for a 1 year base period with 3 one year option periods.  The CoE program is a national program that encourages geographic diversity among its sites and for that reason states may only have two CoEs.  Currently there are 2 CoEs in the states of California, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.  Additionally, academic medical centers in DHHS Region VIII will be given preference during this solicitation since there are currently no CoEs or National Community Centers of Excellence (CCOEs) in this region.  Region VIII includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.  Solicitation 233-03-0023 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website approximately 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for one each Stabilized Single Longitudinal Mode Laser Seeder Unit.	Develop a compact, rugged, electrically efficient, tunable diode laser source suitable for seeding ND:Yag lasers at 1064 nm.  Unseeded ND:Yag lasers exhibit shot-to-shot intensity fluctuations caused by longitudinal mode beating, which under high power operation can damage internal optics and reduce the laser's lifetime.  Injecting a low-power, narrow-linewidth, CW laser beam into the ND:Yag laser cavity eliminates these problems.  The seed laser source will consist of a custom developed semiconductor laser coupled to an electro-optically tunable bragg grating embedded within a waveguide laser.  This development will provide a seed laser source for ND:Yag laser that is significantly more compact, less expensive and more robust than currently available.  All necessary components will be ordered with exact specifications, bragg waveguides will be embedded in KTP substrates that will narrow and stabilize the output of the semiconductor laser.  Parameters will be varied during this process that will product bragg waveguides optimized for this application.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Advr, Inc. Bozeman, MT. Advr, Inc. has a proprietary process which writes a bragg grating in a KTP microship substrate.  This grating is then tuned with low voltage to reflect a desired wavelength.  When coupled with a specially grown strained quantum well laser diode, an externally cavity tuned laser can be set precisely at a variety of wavelengths typical of near infrared solid state materials such as ND:Yag, NC:Vanidate, NDYLF and others. ADVR, Inc. is the only company that is capable of supplying this item.  Currently, there is no laser company that produces an external cavity tuned diode source that can meet the wavelength and packaging requirements.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 3, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Description

A.	INTRODUCTION. The Starfire Optical Range (SOR) Division of Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DES) is located at Kirtland AFB. The Government is interested in receiving proposals in the advanced technology development and research into optical beam control in the presence of the Earth?s turbulent atmosphere.  The total program hours budgeted for these efforts is 122,880 hours over five years (FY03: 7,680 hours, FY04: 24,960 hours, FY05: 24,960 hours,  FY06: 24,960 hours, FY07: 24,960 hours,  FY08: 15,360 hours.  Award to a single offeror is anticipated. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), 03-DE-02, will remain open 45 days after date of publication.  Proposals are solicited for solutions to the problems of optical acquisition/tracking, the sensing of turbulence-induced optical wave front distortions, and real-time mechanical correction of said distortions with adaptive optics techniques.  SOR has investigated and will continue to investigate application of these technologies towards:  1) high-resolution imaging of space objects; and 2) enabling of low and potentially high energy laser propagation systems that can realistically be expected to operate in the presence of the Earth?s turbulent atmosphere.  The contractor should consider innovative techniques for exploring technologies, concepts and applications in these areas.

Utilizing existing range assets and Air Force S&T and customer funding, the SOR seeks to explore and develop advanced techniques that will expand the current ?state of the art? of optical atmospheric compensation.  SOR is equally interested in demonstrating the defense-related capabilities and payoffs of this technology.  Contractors contributing to these efforts will be part of a large, dynamic, integrated team including military personnel, Department of Air Force civilians, and other contractor personnel.   The contractor should address each of the following concepts to insure the Contractor Statement of Work (CSOW) submitted is inclusive.

1.  Field testing of beam control technologies.  SOR is interested in the planning, design and engineering of experiment concepts investigating and demonstrating beam control technologies.  The particular interest is in such technologies as interfaced with large astronomical telescopes, in particular, the assets located at the SOR site.  The interest areas include both imaging and beam projection experimentation.  Innovative techniques and designs utilizing both specially developed technology and commercially available components are desired.  The vision driving all such experiments is the improvement of the Strehl ratio of overall telescope-atmosphere ?system?, and to measure, account for, and mitigate any factors that reduce the Strehl ratio.  To this end, we desire to investigate novel methods for both implementing adaptive optics concepts and measuring the performance of resultant systems.  SOR is especially interested in advanced, real-time Data Acquisition System (DAS) concepts for advanced electro-optical systems, as well as near-real-time processing, data basing, and storage of relevant assessment data.

2.	Analysis, modeling, and simulation.  Assessment of the relative merits of proposed and actual beam control technologies requires knowledge and a demonstrated ability to carry out detailed numerical, analytical and Monte-Carlo simulations of the propagation of light through turbulence.  The simulation of the interaction of light with real and proposed electro-optical and adaptive optical systems is also critical to expanding the state-of-the-art of this area.  Therefore, simulations of the ideas discussed in Area 1 are of interest.  Additionally, the SOR is interested in innovative approaches to analyzing the large volumes of data that would be collected from experiments in Area 1.  It is especially important that the relevance of the experiments to areas of DOD interest can be meaningfully extracted from such data and reported to interested parties throughout the DOD and government.  Unique algorithms and processes that are written in common computer languages and data visualization scripting languages are desired.  It is envisioned that these codes would be flexible, adaptable and user-friendly to the extent that they could serve the entire team of SOR scientists and analysts.

3.  Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) Program Status.  The engineering and analysis mentioned above works with the Ground-Based Laser (GBL) Advanced Technology Demonstration.   The effort will include contract coverage to SOR on current DEBCEA research effort (which includes the GBL ATD) including cost, schedule, and performance.  It is envisioned that contractor personnel will occasionally represent the SOR to other AFRL directorates and other DOD agencies.  They shall attend various program management meetings, project reviews, technical interchange meetings, etc., presenting and preparing materials describing SOR capabilities, activities, and ongoing projects.  External agencies include but are not limited to: government and non-government laboratories, academic institutions, all DOD services and government agencies.

B.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Work performed under any resulting contract may be classified up to the Top Secret Level. The contractor who is selected for an award under this BAA will be required to obtain a Top Secret facility clearance. Open communication with the Technical POC is encouraged until proposals are received.  AFRL evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation.

A site visit is scheduled for 28 Feb 2003.  Interested parties must fax a signed DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, and a Visit Request with clearance information for each visiting employee to the Project Officer, Major Allan Arb, AFRL/DES, FAX:  (505) 846-2213 no later than 21 Feb 2003.  Contractors must be U.S. citizens and will not be allowed to bring in portable computers, cameras, etc. The Project Officer will conduct surveillance of the visit.   No more than two people per firm will be allowed to attend the site visit.

The Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) term contract is expected.  In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror. If the offeror is a large business, any resultant contract will include a subcontracting plan, which will be submitted prior to award. In addition, AFMC 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause, will be applicable, with probable inclusion of Alternates III and VI.  The successful awardee will be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the AFRL/DES support contractor to permit administrative access to proposal data.  Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.  It is anticipated that contractors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, in these cases, offerors will need to be certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) prior to submitting offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572), or logon to http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL for further information on certification and the approval process. All DOE Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs) and DOD FFRDCs C3I Lab, Lincoln Laboratory or Software Engineering Institute may submit proposals in response to this solicitation.  Other FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs not discussed herein shall provide rationale in the proposal that research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that the research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government. Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 52.215-1(e). The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified.

For the purposes of this BAA the business size standard is 1000 employees, NAICS 541710. The acquisition is unrestricted, full and open competition. All firms submitting responses must reference this announcement and indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a woman-owned business, a hubzone certified small business, a historically black college or university, a minority institution, a veteran-owned small business or a service-disabled veteran owned small business.

C.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  Proposals will be evaluated using the following factors in descending order of importance based on scientific peer review: (a) capabilities and related experience, techniques or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives (b) overall technical approach and/or scientific merit of the proposed effort and its relevancy to current and future AFRL/DE needs, and (c) affordability. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the successful proposal other than price realism and reasonableness will be evaluated and negotiated on the proposal selected for award.  Price overall is a substantial consideration in selecting a proposal for award but it is secondary to technical considerations. When requested, a debriefing will be provided IAW FAR 15.505 and 15.506.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Lisa Sedlar, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, for a continuation of services for the indexing of digital documents produced by the Digital Manuscripts Program of NLM.  The contractor shall provide a range of analytical tasks for the indexing of digitized documents in the Digital Manuscripts Program.  Lisa Sedlar, while a student employee here at the Digital Manuscripts Program, National Library of Medicine, developed the system for indexing the documents of the Program.  In this work, she carried out an analysis of the project and its documents and became familiar with the subject headings that most often find usage in the program.  Thus she is uniquely skilled to carry out the project to index the backlog of documents.  Her background assists in developing and maintaining this skill level, with both a degree and experience working in clinical medicine, a Master's degree in Library and Information Science, and experience with the delivery of information through the web.  Ms. Sedlar has also completed Center for Information Technology (CIT) training courses on ADA's Section 508 standards and worked for 2 years assisting the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS) offices in the development and implementation of regional web sites.  Ms. Sedlar provided assistance with website layout and content as prescribed by regional CIS office guidelines; evaluated the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and CIS websites; and assisted with the development of the CIS Intranet site.  This combined experience has provided Ms. Sedlar with both the scientific and information specialist skills and knowledge to perform this job with skill, speed, and accuracy.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of training time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of eight (8) months.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ) nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Responses are required within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate on a noncompetitve basis with INH Technologies in Bendbrook, TX for 90 units of NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Remote Off Air Monitoring System (ROAMS) with an option to acquire an additional 90 units.  The ROAMS, developed by INH Technology, is designed to assist in determining problems that may occur at NWR transmitter sites, both local and remote.  When installed at a transmitter site, the ROAMS monitors the status of several key operational parameters of the transmitter system at the site.  When it detects an error or fault condition in the monitored parameters, it reports that condition by placing a telephone call to a designated location.  ROAMS also is used by the Console Replacement System (CRS) to capture NWR specific area message encoder messages for validation purposes.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a system capable of meeting the previously cited requirements.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A
determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is issued by CH2M Hill Mound, Inc. (CHM) Prime contractor to the Department of Energy (DOE) under prime contract DE-AC-03OH20152 to identify potential small business sources who are interested in submitting a proposal for the outsourcing of the Radiological Instrumentation Calibration, Maintenance, and Repair Operation at the Miamisburg, Ohio Mound site. 

The effort required for the operation of the Radiological Instrumentation Calibration Operation is extensive and critical to the successful Miamisburg Closure Project. The management of this operation shall be in accordance with Title 10 CFR 835; American National Standards Institute (ANSI N323); and, 10 CFR 830.120 through the implementation of Mound Technical Manual 10215 operating procedures and the CH2M Hill documented radiation protection program (PP-9350).

Specifically, the responsibilities of the Radiological Instrumentation Calibration function include, but not limited to, the following:

(a)  Troubleshoot and repair of radiation monitoring equipment;
(b)  Calibration of radiation monitoring equipment;
(c)  Maintenance of instrument tracking database;
(d)  Perform "as found" reading on instrumentation;
(e)  Conduct performance testing of instrumentation;
(f)  Develop acceptance testing procedures;
(g)  Conduct validation and verification on new instrumentation;
(h)  Maintain source control and tracking;
(i)  Establish and maintain spare parts inventory;
(j)  Control and maintain facility security.

Since the outsourcing of this function may eventually lead to the commercialization of the Radiological Instrumentation Calibration, Maintenance, and Repair operation, it is our intent, at this time, to require all Offerors to possess or demonstrate the ability to obtain all federal, state and local licenses required for the handling and possession of various radioactive sources.  Because of the security requirements Offerors must either have or be capable of receiving a positive Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) determination.

Interested companies shall submit the following pre-qualification data:

(a)  Prior and current corporate experience related to 
     radiological instrumentation calibration, maintenance and 
     repair;	
(b)  Description of staff qualifications;
(c)  Description of applicable by-product material and special 
     nuclear materials licenses or plan and schedule to obtain 
     necessary licenses.

The pre-qualification submittals will be evaluated by CHM to develop a bidder's list. It is currently estimated that the RFP will be issued in late-March 2003.  Submittals are required no later than February 27, 2003 addressed to:

<DESC>MICHELSON-CHAUVENET HALLS RENOVATION - PHASE I

The Project is located on the campus of the United States Naval Academy and consists of Phase I of the complete renovation of the Michelson-Chauvenet Halls complex, including Architectural, Structural, Mechanical, Fire Protection, Electrical, Telecommunications/Data, and Security systems.  The project involves complete demolition of all non-structural interior elements of the building, including HazMat abatement, and involves complete reconfiguration of the interior walls, circulation and engineering systems of the building, as well as limited renovation of the exterior building envelop.  Phase I and Phase II together form a 82,300 GSM (270,000 GSF) academic complex consisting of laboratories, classrooms, offices and support spaces, configured as twin office/classroom towers on the upper levels and sharing a common laboratory floor at ground level.  Phase I consists of approximately half of the complex or approximately 41,000 GSM (135,000 GSF) and includes the Michelson tower and a portion of the common laboratory level. The total Michelson-Chauvenet complex houses the Science and Math Departments of USNA and is used for the teaching of Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Oceanography, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.  The complex was built in the early 1970s and the building systems and laboratory equipment have both reached the limit of their expected service life and therefore need to be completely replaced.  The building layout and services do not effectively support the requirements of current teaching methods and curricula and therefore need to be completely re-configured.  The estimated project cost range is approximately 25,000,000 to 35,000,000.  The project is subject to a very compressed construction schedule due to mandatory academic year constraints.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>JEFF PALACHAT CONTRACTING OFFICER 9283438138     JPALACHAT@LC.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, has a new requirement for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the Water Quality Improvement Center (WQIC) advanced water treatment research facility located within the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP) complex at 7301Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona.  The WQIC research facility includes: the Yuma Area Office (YAO) Analytical Laboratory; Reclamation's only research and demonstration pilot-scale facility specializing in the advancement of water treatment and desalination technology; and other related WQIC and YDP requirements. The WQIC is a designated National Center for Water Treatment Technology, a nation-wide affiliation of publicly-funded water-research facilities that partner with the public for testing. The National Water Research Institute, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Army sponsor the National Centers Program. The goal of the National Centers Program is to promote improved water-treatment processes through united research efforts by government, academia, and private industry. There are currently only seven National Centers in the U.S., and each center explores different water research focus areas.  The Analytical Laboratory supports the YDP, WQIC and other Government authorized operations by performing chemical, biological, and physical tests; and preparing the data for engineering and data reporting.  The mission of the WQIC is to advance the development and transfer of water purification technologies at its state-of-the-art facility through field tests, hands-on training, and implementation. The varying levels of research focus on the following research goals: (1) analytical laboratory services for YDP and the YAO; (2) to reduce the cost to operate and maintain the YDP; (3) securing safe, clean water supplies for the West now and in the future; and (4) transferring federally-developed technology to the public pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. The successful contractor shall provide all contract management, planning, supervision, administration, personnel, operation, engineering support, labor, tools, equipment, supplies, materials, chemicals, services, transportation, and facilities necessary to perform service in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).   The selected contractor must exhibit extensive advance water treatment research experience specializing in reverse osmosis (RO) desalting technology as specified in the SOW areas:  (1) Administration; (2) Operations; (3) Maintenance; and (4) Engineering support. The proposed contract is a fixed price labor rate incentive type contract.  The performance period will have a base (1 year) and four 1 year options.  The Government is responsible for determining the contractor's level of responsibility for each contract year.  The Government, at its option and with notice, may increase or decrease the level of responsibility to achieve a desired level of support in accordance with the SOW.   This solicitation is a Two-Step Competitive Procedure:  (1) Step one - offerors will be invited to submit a technical proposal in accordance with Section M.  The Government will determine which firms are technically acceptable (down-selecting to all technically acceptable contractors).  The planned evaluation criteria are as follows: corporate experience, past performance, management and technical approach, staffing requirements, transition approach, subcontractors (small business).  Firms determined technically acceptable will be provided the opportunity to compete in Step two (cost).  (2) Step two - offerors will be invited to submit a fixed price proposal in accordance with Section M.   A fixed price labor rate award with an incentive (up to 6%) will be made to the firm that has been rated technically acceptable and offers the lowest acceptable price.   Effective October 1, 1997, contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.ccr.gov.  This solicitation is a full and open competition solicitation.  The NACS code is 561210 (Facility Support Services).  The solicitation will be available on or about May 01, 2003.  Requests for the solicitation must be in writing and should be directed to the Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, Attn:  Jeff Palachat, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ 85364.  A fax request will be accepted at the following number 928-343-8568.   Requestors must provide a physical mailing address, fax number, e-mail address and telephone number.  All responsible sources may compete and be considered by the agency.  There is no charge for the first copy; additional copies are available at $25.00 per copy, non-refundable.  Checks should be sent to:  Yuma Area Office, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Attn:  Jeff Palachat, Yuma AZ 85364.

5.	Building Marine Corps Multi-Switch Networks (BMCMSN)
This course teaches Marines how to build campus networks using multilayer switching technologies over high speed Ethernet. This course addresses the integration of routing and switching technologies to create an efficient Marine Corps network.
The one sentence goal for this course is best stated:
The purpose of this course is to design, build and configure a Marine Corps network so that if any physical link, switch or router fails an end user won't know; i.e. 24x7 user access to the network.
To meet this goal the Marines will be taught not only to design physical redundancy into their network, but about the Layer 2 and 3 protocols that are necessary to guarantee users constant access to the Marine Corps network.
Spanning Tree is a layer 2 protocol that permits redundant layer 2 physical paths. Spanning Tree is covered in depth in this course. Marines will review the default spanning tree rules, then be shown why they usually do not want to accept many of the default spanning tree parameters. They will be shown how to "tweak" the default spanning tree parameters so that their data is taking the correct physical path and that in the event this path fails, a backup path is quickly made available. They will learn about protocols such as Uplinkfast and Backbonefast that need to be configured to speed convergence times in the event a physical path fails. They will learn why DHCP will fail unless "portfast" is enabled. They will also learn how to get more bandwidth between network devices by configuring etherchannel.
At the higher layers the Marines will learn the advantages of Layer 3 and 4 switching and the steps necessary to configure this process. They will also learn how to configure routers to run HSRP so that if a router fails another router will take over routing user traffic.
Among the skills the Marines will learn are: To create VLANs. To propogate VLAN information with VTP. To manage Redundant Links with Spanning Tree.To enable InterVLAN Routing.To improve IP Routing Performance With Multilayer Switching.To implement HSRP for Fault Tolerant Routing.To manage High Bandwidth Broadcasts With IP Multicasts.

THIS 5 SESSION TRAINING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE ORDER ABOVE AND BE PROVIDED DURING THE MARCH ? JULY 2003 TIME FRAME.  BIDS SUBMITTED SHOULD BE BROKEN DOWN BY COST PER COURSE.  10-20 STUDENTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO ATTEND EACH COURSE.

Are there other similar contracts already awarded? Can you tell me who the Project Manager is if that would be appropriate ? RESPONSE: Currently, there is no contract in place for this requirement at the MTMC.  However, USTRANSCOM does have a contracting vehicle in place for this requirement.  This is not a follow-on procurement.  No preliminary work has been completed on this project.  A t the present time, the government cannot release the name of the Project Manager.  Any and all inquiries regarding this procurement should be sent in writing directly to the Contract Specialist and/or the Contracting Officer. QUESTION #18: Endeavor Systems is a small woman owned company in Northern Virginia Specializing in network security.  After reviewing the solicitation DAMT01-03-R-0034, Endeavor is too small of a company to respond to such an RFP. Endeavor is capable of doing portions o f this work.  Is there are small business set aside for this contract, or a list of bidders that Endeavor can solicit to in an attempt team as a subcontractor? RESPONSE: The government is seeking a firm from industry that can accomplish all the required task outlined in the Statement of Work.   At this time, the government cannot award a contract for portions of the task.  However, the government does encourage teaming arr angements and/or subcontracting possibilities.  This requirement is not set-aside for small business nor does the government retain a bidders mailing list.  All requirements are synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPS) web page. QUESTION 19: I received the above referenced solicitation today and noted that it is listed as a full & open competition.  My question -- Does the customer have a preference on a contract vehicle type or have one in mind? RESPONSE:   In accordance with the solicitation, the contracting vehicle will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP). QUESTION #20: The solicitation calls for some portion of the tasking to be accomplished by an MTMC-based contractor team. Can you clarify how much and what type of work must be performed onsite and how much can be performed at contractor facilities? Burns & McDonnell is  currently performing very similar work for the Joint Program Office for Special Technology Countermeasures in support of the Infrastructure Assurance Program. However, 80% of our analysis and database development efforts are performed in our facility. RESPONSE: At the present time, the MTMC does not have this information. QUESTION#21:   Is this solicitation for a new effort or is it for the continuation of an ongoing effort already being provided by contractors? RESPONSE:   This is a new requirement for the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC). QUESTION #22:  The length of time between provision of the solicitation (1/22/03) and the closing date (2/5/03) is a very short time period in which to Respond. Can you provide clarification on the requirement for such a short response period? RESPONSE:   In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), all commercial items over $25K must be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Website.  All commercial solicitations must be synopsized up to 15 business days.  It is up to the Contract ing Officer if the solicitation will be closed prior to the 15- day window or if the solicitation closing date will be extended.  However, in this case, this solicitation will be synopsized for the entire 15-day window.   QUESTION #23: Will opportunity be provided for oral presentation of proposals? RESPO NSE: At the present time, the government is not entertaining oral presentations, however, the solicitation may be amended to include oral presentations and their relative weighting factors. QUESTION #24:  In reading the major tasks in paragraph 3. OBJECTIVES, page 3 of the solicitation I understand those tasks to be referencing the Critical Infrastructure Protection of the actual physical transportation infrastructure itself such as road, rail, and waterbor ne resources; and not the information systems in support of those Critical Infrastructure Protection systems. Is that a correct assumption?  RESPONSE: No. QUESTION #25: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), McLean, VA is interested in submitting a proposal for this solicitation.  I called your office this morning and left a voice message in reference to the subject Request For Proposal (RFP).  Trying to t rack down a copy of the statement of work (SOW) for this RFP.  I understand that this solicitation has been posted for reviewing under MTMC's homepage under Business Center, Solicitations and locate the number.  Unfortunately, I've tried and was unable to retrieve or review it.  I understand there's a closing date of 10:00am EST on 5 Feb03 and would like to get a copy of the SOW so that we can submit our proposal.  Additionally, do you have any information on another MTMC proposal for Cooperative Threat Red uction SOW (264)?  Any assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated. RESPONSE: The Contracting Officer did return the telephone call.  The MTMC web page has this solicitation listed and can be downloaded.  If you are still experiencing difficulties with downloading this solicitation, please contact Ms. Nora Cherry, Contract Specialis t at (703) 428-2013 or Ms. Toye Latimore, Contracting Officer at (703) 428-2067 and one of us will walk you through downloading this solicitation from our web page. QUESTION #26: Is there an incumbent currently satisfying this opportunity or is this a new opportunity.  RESPONSE: No QUESTION #27: Is price evaluated at all?  The evaluation criteria indicate the price factor is not rated. RESPONSE: This is correct; price is not evaluated with an adjectival rating.  QUESTION #28: If price is not evaluated, do you have a price range or anticipated level of effort? RESPONSE: The Government has an Independent Government Cost Estimate that cannot be released to industry. QUESTION #29: Will there be an evaluation preference for 8A and/or Hub zone firms? RESPONSE: No. QUESTION #30. Can a short (i.e. 5 day) extension of the proposal due date be granted to permit for response/adjustments after receipt of questions and answers? RESPONSE: See this amendment for the revised extension date.   QUESTION #31: Please provide direction as to the proposal submission instructions for this RFP, type of submission, hardcopy only, or will an electronic file be required via CD, or other means?  If electronic, what software/version? RESPONSE: The proposal submission was addressed in amendment 1.  The MTMC request that all offerors submit 2 original signed hard copies of their proposal and 1 CD version of their cost and technical proposal, in word format.  The cost proposal should be in excel fo rmat and also submitted on a CD. QUESTION #32: On page 14, CLIN 1002, should there also be a NTE $15,000 for travel? RESPONSE: See item 6 above. QUESTION #33: DFI International is a small research and analysis firm located in Washington, DC with both government and corporate consulting practices.  Is there an incumbent?  Is there a bidders list and would it be possible to obtain a copy? Is it a small business se t aside? RESPONSE: There is no incumbent for this requirement.  The government does not maintain a bidders mailing list.  This is not a small business set-aside requirement. QUESTION #34: Can the fill-in clauses be reduced in content to those sections 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certi fications) and 52.223-13 (Certification of Toxic Chemical Release Reporting for which the offeror is to provide the appropriate information)? RESPONSE: Yes, QUESTION #35: Are the cost proposal and BOE pages to be considered within the 100-page limit? RESPONSE: Yes. QUESTION #36: In order to accurately determine the scope and complexity of the tasks in this solicitation, can you provide a summary, additional information, point of contact or the following program guidance as referenced in your solicitation:  A) The Presidential and SECDEF guidance MTMC is using to implement the CIP program as referenced in the Background Paragraph 2 of the SOW.  B) Information on the USTRANSCOM mapping of critical surface transportation assets and USTRANSCOMs development of the DoD Transportation da tabase referenced in the Objectives paragraph 3 to the SOW.  C) Information on the DoD CIP Integrated Staff (CHIPS), the USTRANSCOM CIP Program guidance, and DoD Directives 8320.1-M-1 required supporting Task 5.2 and subtasks 5.2.1 through 5.2.4.  D) Infor mation including number, frequency and duration of the exercises such as USTRANSCOMs annual command post exercise referenced in Task 5.2.6.  Subtask 6. RESPONSE: A)    Presidential is PDD 63; SECDEF guidance is DOD CIP Plan.  B)	 USTC mapping refers basically to the focused 5678 spreadsheet  DOD transportation database is a USTRANSCOM contractor task, with minimal MTMC effort. C)	 Information on the CIPIS is in the DOD CIP Plan; USTRANSCOMs CIP program guidance essentially is our DISAP (extract attached); DODD 8320.1 can be found at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/dir2.html  D)	 USTRANSCOM CPXs:  Normally one or two per year at USTRANSCOM  minimal if any MTMC contractor support required. QUESTION #37: Currently the SOW does not provide any scooping of FTE for tasks and subtask that appear to be level of effort such as in paragraph 5.2.1 Subtask 1 The contractor will continue to identify critical surface transportation assets as stipulated Tier-I nodes  and in Paragraph 5.2.2 Subtask 2 As directed by the MTMC CIP PM, the contractor will provide support under subtask 3 Could level of effort anticipated for each of the subtasks be defined to enable an accurate FFP submission to meet your needs? RESPONSE: No. QUESTION #38: Paragraph 8.1 and 8.2 Option years:  It is not clear whether the customer foresees a change in scope or content of effort for each option year.  It would be useful if the SOW would provide some definitization of FTEs anticipated and skill required. RESPONSE: At the present time, the MTMC does not foresee a change in scope or content of effort for each option year.   QUESTION #39: In light of this request so contractors can accurately scope this solicitation and provide the best services for the fairest price to MTMC, request an extension to the current submission date of February 5, 2003 to February 12, 2003 to incorporate answers to questions in our proposal. RESPONSE: Granted to 21 February 2003.  See this amendment for time submittal of all proposals.

Additionally, an option for an additional quantity of eight (8) each of the above listed part numbers will be included. This basic quantity and option quantity represents all known requirements at this time. The acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not own specifications or complete drawings. Leica Geosystems Inc. is the only known source with the knowledge, experience and technical data required to perform this effort. The TM5100A Theodolite comprises of 1 TM5100A Motorized Precision Theodolite with Autocollimation, 1 GEB87 Plug-In Battery, 1 GDF22-I Tribrach with grey optical plummet, 1 GKL22-1 Battery Charger, and 1 AL51 Autocollimation lamp. The TM5100A Theodolite is the only known replacement for the T2 Universal Theodolite. The T2 Universal Theodolite is an obsolete piece of equipment, and the TM5100A Theodolite is the only suitable replacement that meets form, fit, and function of the T2 Universal Theodolite. The Theodolite is used to test the AN/AVQ-28, AN/AVQ-32, and the AN/AVQ-36 head up display (HUD). The Theodolite is used to provide a precision optical reference for testing and adjusting the HUD's azimuth, roll, and elevation reference planes, a capability necessary when boresighting the HUD. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which may or may not be used by the Government in determining whether or not to open this requirement to competition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation FU252233290200 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.
This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS code 5621111, which has a small business size standard of $10.5 million.
The requirement consists of the following, (CLIN #, Quantity and Unit of Issue, Description;) This statement of work (SOW) details the requirements for the disposal of the solid waste generated at Clear Air Force Station (CAFS).  The services provided to CAFS by the Contractor will be continuous and ongoing.  A schedule will be established that maintains adequate solid waste storage at the facility and meets facility operating requirements. Installation Description; CAFS is located approximately 78 miles southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska on the George Park?s Highway.  The facilities at CAFS support their mission.  The Composite Area includes administration offices (Building 201 and 202), personnel quarters (Buildings 203-204), supply (Building 250 and 252), CAFS Fire Department (Building 251), and vehicle maintenance (Building 196).  The Camp Area buildings include Civil Engineering offices, shops, and storage buildings, auxiliary dorm buildings, and Security Forces.  The coal-fired power plant produces the electricity and heat for the site and includes Buildings 111 to 115.  The current radar system, the Solid State Phased-Array Radar System (SSPARS), is located in Building 800.  One office in building 101 (PMEL) and one office in building 102 (JRCS) are still occupied ten hours a day by a total of five people each day, Monday through Friday.  Otherwise, buildings 101 through 106 are no longer occupied.  Solid Waste Generation and Storage; CAFS employs approximately 80 military personnel, 50 civil service personnel, and 200 contractors. The CAFS facilities include 263 dorm rooms in the Composite Area and 150 dorm rooms in the Camp Area to house these employees.  The majority of the military and half of the civil service personnel consider CAFS their primary residence.  The majority of the contractor personnel live at CAFS for approximately 169 days per year.  CAFS produces approximately 6760 cubic yards or 1690 tons of municipal solid waste per year.  An average of 130 cubic yards or 325 tons of municipal solid waste are generated per week.  CAFS will continue to use Dumpsters for solid waste storage.  The location of the solid waste collection Dumpsters is shown in Figure 3.  Each Dumpster is indicated by a red dot.  Because of the small capacity of the Dumpsters, some areas maintain multiple Dumpsters for solid waste storage.  The Dumpsters are eight-yard flat top, front-loading containers manufactured by the Cascade Container-Fab Company, a Division of McLestkey Enterprises, Inc. and located at 26406 NW 19th Avenue, Ridgefield, WA  98642 (1-800-628-8722).  The Dumpsters have outside dimensions of 80-inch length, 72-inch width, and 75-inch height.  The fork holes run the depth of the Dumpster and are 9 inches high by 4 inches wide.  The Dumpsters are a standard front-loading Dumpster and meet ANSI standard Z245.3.  All trucks with adjustable forks will be compatible with the Dumpsters.  CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS; This section details the requirements of the Contractor to dispose of the solid waste from CAFS.  Disposal; The Contractor will dispose of all solid waste from CAFS in a Landfill approved by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  The Denali Borough Landfill is the closest landfill to CAFS that meets these requirements.  The Contractor will provide the CAFS Environmental Health Services Department with a current solid waste disposal permit issued by the ADEC.  The landfill will be inspected by the ADEC as appropriate and the Contractor will provide CAFS Environmental Health Services Department with a copy of all inspections.  Additionally, the Contractor will allow the Air Force or personnel designated by the Air Force to inspect the landfill annually or with a frequency to be established by the Air Force.  Any discrepancies noted by the Air Force designated personnel will be addressed by the Contractor to meet the satisfaction of the Air Force.  Billing; The Contractor will bill the Air Force on a monthly basis, or as determined by the Air Force Finance Manager.  Each invoice will reference the contract number to expedite processing and payment.  A copy of the monthly invoice will be sent to 13 SWS, P.O. Box 40013, Clear AFS, AK 99704-0013. 3.0 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; The Contractor will provide the Environmental Health Services office with an inventory of all hazardous materials brought onto CAFS property.  The Contractor will properly dispose of any waste produced from the use of hazardous materials at CAFS.  The Contractor will remove all remaining hazardous materials brought to CAFS after the required work has been performed.

<DESC>Firms should address the following additional requirements in their submittal of 254/255s: Cold weather Design/Construction experience for projects in the rural, remote areas of the State of Alaska.  Applicants should demonstrate prior experience with the special design/construction features required to satisfy the demands of the severe cold and in some cases, salt air environments such as:  1. Foundations & underground utility systems in permafrost, boggy or high water table conditions; 2.  Ultra high insulation/R-values combined with durable, low maintenance exterior building systems (doors, windows, roofs, exterior siding, etc.); 3. Arctic architectural features (arctic entry's, ice damming, orientation for snow drifting, etc) required for Arctic locations; 4.  Dependable, low-maintenance mechanical systems designed for remote, extreme cold and high wind conditions; 5.  Project planning that addresses the extremely short construction seasons in Alaska and also the unusual logistical system of material supply barges that ship from Northwest locations in the lower U.S.; and 6.  Preparation of construction cost estimates that recognize all of the above considerations. The selection criteria (1) and (4) are revised as follows: (1) Past performance on contracts for architect and engineering services with government agencies and private industry in terms of quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. For the last ten completed projects identify the type of construction contract, give number and value of construction change orders; give the project schedules (design and construction) with scheduled completion versus actual completion; and provide letters of recommendation and federal agency performance evaluations. Identify both a project client and an end-user point of contact with current phone numbers and email addresses for each project. Referenced projects should not be more than five years old. (SF 254, paragraphs 10 and 11, and SF 255, paragraphs 8, 9, and 10, plus supplemental information.) (4) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required. Experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to each project, to include skills in architectural design, mechanical, electrical, civil and structural engineering, commissioning, cost estimating, computer-aided drafting, project coordination and construction management, inspection. (SF 254, paragraphs 10 and 11, and SF 255, paragraphs 4, 7, 8, and 9.) Clarifications:  Since most work will be done outside of the Kansas City are, proximity to Kansas City is not as important as the firms ability to communicate effectively with the offices located in Kansas City.  Firm should provide information in their submittal that demonstrates their ability to communicated to communicate effectively with the staff located in Kansas City

<DESC>The RFI seeks information about potential sources for a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)search engine which will integrate into or interface with a Lotus Domino application on an IBM x370 Windows platform.  The product can be, but is not required to be, a stand-alone product.  The engine must have the capability to earch meta data as well as the text in documents stored in a Lotus Domino (Domino.Doc) environment.  The search engine must be able to search for text in documents in standard work processing and spreadsheet formats and within PDF files; however, the capablity to search any database or file format is desirable.

Many of the docments stored in the system are tiff files produced by scanning paper documents.  The current document management application produces a text version of the documents from these tiff images through the use of an optical character recognition versions of the tiff images (scanned documents).

The search engin must be capable of "fuzzy seraches" in order to maximize hits when searching the uncorrected text produced by the OCR engine.  This "contaminated data" typically has a large number of errors per page (i.e. misspelled words) that limit the success of searches dependent on exact string matching.  A search engine limited to exact string matching is not adequate (even if wild card are supported).

The results of a text search should be displayed as a list of "hits" (i.e., occurrences of matches to the search criteria) that are displayed in context, that is, within a snippet of text surrounding each "hit."  The results should be displayed in rank order with the highest ranking "hit" listed first.  Each document should be displayed once even though there are multiple hits within that document (or that should be a user-selected option).  Along with each snippet of text should be a link t the actual file.  The link should open the document in a viewer or the native application.

<CONTACT>Thomas McFadden, Contract Specialist, Phone 202/353-4063, Fax 202/307-9695, Email Thomas.McFadden@usdoj.gov
<DESC>The USMS has a requirement for the services of armed and unarmed guards in the Dallas-Ft. Worth region each of whom must meet the following requirements: active or former commissioned law enforcement officers, Certified Law Enforcement Training (CLEET), no criminal record, no history of emotional/mental illness, alcohol or drug abuse, in good standing with their department, U.S. citizenship, at least 21 years of age, speak fluent English, and possess a valid drivers license. Some female guards are required and some guards with Spanish language skills are necessary.  
The services to be performed include transporting Federal prisoners, guarding prisoners confined to a medical facility for treatment, guarding prisoners within a U.S. Courthouse building and holding facilities, and providing security for Government-seized property.  Unarmed guards may be appropriate for court security and cell block assignments only at the discretion of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The services are required on an "on call" basis. This means that  24 hours a day, 7 days a week the contractor must be prepared to assign guards to receive Federal prisoners within 2 hours of receiving a verbal request from the COTR. The contractor must provide a list or roster of qualified persons that the contractor has available for performance of the contract and maintain that list throughout the life of the contract as new personnel become available or others become unavailable.  The contractor may only assign guards from that roster and must employ supervisors who meet the same standards as the guards.
The contractor will be responsible for providing all equipment required for its guards including but not limited to uniforms and approved restraining devices for prisoners in its custody. The contractor is responsible for transporting prisoners in secure vehicles such as screened vans or sedans. The Government will not reimburse contractor's expense as a separate billable cost; the contractor must recover that expense within the contract price of the hourly charge negotiated for guard services ordered by the Government and delivered.
Actual quantities of services required under this contract are unknown.  The quantities will vary according to the operational requirements of the Government. Maximum quantities that may be ordered will be 3000 hours of armed and 2500 hours of unarmed service per year.  If the Government's actual requirements do not result in orders in the quantities estimated, that fact will not constitute a basis for equitable adjustment.  In 2002, under the existing contract, the Government has ordered approximately 1604 hours of armed and 1184 hours of unarmed services.  The Government anticipates that a base year contract with 4 twelve-month priced option periods will be awarded.  Any contract will incorporate the Service Contract Act.
The Government estimates that the Request for Proposals will be available on or after March 15, 2003. Parties interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation should e-mail the POC and when the solicitation is available on the web, each will be notified.  Interested parties are requested to include with that e-mail a Capabilities Statement to assist this market research. For example: identify and certify one's business size, outline the scope of one's existing personnel resources in Northern Texas or ability to build a roster of qualified personnel, one's experience in fulfilling other Government contracts of this type, and any other statements regarding capabilities that are relevant.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE -- The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH) laboratory facility in Morgantown, WV has already purchased a license for the AirPak ventilation computational fluid dynamics modeling software package developed by Fluent, Inc.  We now have a need to renew the software license.  The government desires to purchase a perpetual license since our currently funded projects in our DRDS, Laboratory Research Branch (LRB) involve an AirPak modeling component  through FY2008.  The perpetual license will ultimately realize a financial savings to NIOSH.  The perpetual license includes customer support and service which is necessary to assure quality modeling results.    The Fluent software program is produced only by Fluent, Inc.  Data has already been calculated with this software and it should be compatible for use in continuing projects.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source  basis with Fluent, Inc., Lebanon, NH.   Organizations  who believe they can provide the required license and upgrade may respond within 10 days after publication of this notice.  Responses shall be submitted to:  Brenda L. Goodwin (MS-1019), Reference: #2003-Q-00783, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.   This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  This notice is issued for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The USAF Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is conducting a technology survey to research state-of-the-art, deployable Aerospace Ground Support Equipment (AGE) Air Conditioners. Specifically, research will focus on mobile, deployable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified COTS flight line equipment capable of meeting or exceeding performance and deployability characteristics. Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC) is supporting the AEFB by performing the survey and will focus research on towable, diesel engine-driven air conditioning systems currently or readily available for demonstration within one year. CTC will report cost, performance, size, availability and point-of-contact information for systems that meet the following requirements and will deliver the results of the survey in a report to the AEFB. The system must be towable and should be capable of operating at altitudes up to 6000 feet and in environments with temperatures ranging from -40 degrees F to 115 degrees F. The system should use R-134A refrigerant or some type of air cycle machine rated at 1,200,000 btu/hr and airflow should be at least 390 PPM at 3 PSIG (minimum of 5 independently controlled 8 inch ports). The delivered air temperature range should be 45 degrees F to 100 degrees F and the system should have a run time of 8 to 10 hours on a full tank of fuel. The system may include more than one piece. Dimensions and weight must allow the complete system to deploy in a single KC-135 tanker aircraft. The maximum size for a roll-on system should be 4200 pounds, with a maximum height of 74 inches and a maximum width of 52 inches. Length would be dependent upon the capability to load the system through the 117-inch wide by 78-inch high aircraft cargo door opening into the 10-foot wide by 70-foot long cargo compartment.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
              AIR FORCE MEDIATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES

                      Reference # F49642-03-R-XXXX

The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (www.adr.af.mil) is requesting information for a potential acquisition to acquire dispute resolution services and support in several functional areas, at locations across the continental United States. The potential acquisition would be for approximately 100 mediation or mentoring sessions per year and ADR functional support.  Currently, Air Force military and civilian employees perform these services in conjunction with a Government contractor.

The overall purpose of the ADR Program is to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques and processes to resolve disputes in appropriate cases. The Air Force recognizes the benefits in time and cost savings/avoidance through these measures as well as the intangible benefits received when disputes are settled in a faster, more appropriate, more amiable process than the traditional administrative or adjudicative options.

The Air Force seeks to promote the use of ADR to resolve disputes in which the Air Force is a party. To do so, its personnel must be made aware of what ADR is, what it offers them, how to initiate its use, how the different processes work, and which one(s) are appropriate for their situation. Furthermore, the Air Force seeks to train its personnel to screen cases for ADR, use as well as actually use the techniques and conduct the processes. While the Air Force educates its personnel about ADR and trains its people to conduct these processes, there is also a need to assist the Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in tailoring the overall program to meet their command specific requirements. This effort also requires a marketing effort to encourage all Air Force personnel at every level to consider using ADR to resolve their disputes should the need arise. 

Types of workplace disputes requiring mediation, mediation mentoring, and third party neutral services include the following:

Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Complaints,
Agency Grievances (AGS), 
Negotiated Grievances (NGS), 
Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Complaints, 
Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) cases, and 
Disputes between Military Members deemed appropriate for resolution through the ADR process IAW AFI 36-2706 (as amended). 

The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program is divided into three functional areas: Management and Administration Support Services, ADR Program Support, and ADR Program Website.

<CONTACT>Klaus D Sexton, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-2271, Fax (301) 286-6299, Email Klaus.D.Sexton.1@gsfc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information from potential sources regarding the availability, cost, capabilities and specifications of high data rate systems applicable to Ka-Band data services within NASA's Space Network (SN) and information regarding industry's capabilities to design, analyze and demonstrate an end to end communications architecture for bandwidth efficient use and characterization of the 650MHz-wide TDRS channel.     Due to increasing congestion in the S-, X-, and Ku-band frequency spectrums, and an ever-increasing demand for higher data rate transmissions by customer spacecraft, it has become necessary to explore the use of higher radio frequency spectrum for NASA space-to-ground communications requirements.  The available spectrum is a finite resource, and as the data throughput requirements from space to ground increase beyond the available X and Ku-band spectrum, it will become necessary for NASA low earth orbiting (LEO) spacecraft to transition to the allocated Ka-Band spectrum for space to ground communications links via NASA's SN and Ground Network (GN). NASA/GSFC is currently implementing the next generation of tracking and data relay satellites used to support low earth orbit customer spacecraft.  TDRS H was launched in July 2000 and is currently operational.	TDRS I and J have also been launched, and are currently undergoing on-orbit testing, and are scheduled to be operational in early 2003.	TDRS H,I,J will maintain compatibility with existing customer spacecraft at S- and Ku-bands while adding a Ka-band space-to-space link communications capability.	The Ka-band space-to-space forward link will operate in the 22.55 GHz to 23.55 GHz band, with the return link from the customer spacecraft to TDRS H,I,J tunable across the 25.25 to 27.5 GHz band with a channel bandwidth up to 650 MHz.	The TDRS space-to-ground links will continue to operate at Ku-band.   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by NASA/GSFC to seek broad community comments and inputs concerning high data rate systems applicable to Ka-Band data services within NASA's Space Network (SN).  Vendors are encouraged to provide ideas, concepts, and architectures that could be used to test and demonstrate their high data rate equipment through the TDRS 650 MHz-wide channel at rates of 1 Gbps or higher.  Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is currently performing infrastructure upgrades within the SN, and demonstrations (up to 600 Mbps) of high rate RF equipment utilizing NASA's new Ka-band capable TDRS H,I,J spacecraft.  As a next step to this upgrade, NASA intends to perform a major expansion to the SN through the procurement and implementation of high data rate (1 Gbps or higher) data demodulation, processing, and storage technologies for use in the SN.  Procurement and implementation activities for the SN Ka-band data service upgrade is anticipated in FY 06. Interested firms are requested to submit a capabilities statement of 12 pages or less, and information regarding approaches to an end-to-end design, analysis and demonstration for bandwidth efficient use of the 650MHz-wide TDRS channel.  Such information should include the technical approach to achieving maximum feasible data rates through the 650MHz-wide channel, detailed description of the specific equipment, and types of demonstrations available to validate and characterize the SN high data rate performance.  Also, requested are associated timelines and cost estimates.   Responses may be sent via regular mail, electronic mail or fax to: Yen F. Wong, Yen.F.Wong@nasa.gov, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Code 567, Bldg 12, Rm E226A, Greenbelt, MD 20771 301-286-7446, Fax 301-286-1725  All information received will be combined and used for Government purposes.  Sources are urged to describe their approach in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information may be appropriate.  The information received in response to this RFI will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of Government and industry experts.  Some or part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   Technical questions should be directed to:  Keiji Tasaki at 301-286-6724 or Yen Wong at 301-286-7446. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Klaus Sexton at 301-286-2271. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.	A commercial item is defined in Internet "Note A".

AWARD AND EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS.  (A)  By use of numerical scoring techniques, proposals are evaluated against the evaluation factors specified below.  These factors are listed in their relative order of importance.  (B)  The government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value, as defined in FAR Part 2.101, after evaluation in accordance with the factors listed below.  All technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price, i.e., corporate experience and past performance, personnel qualifications and the adequacy and relevancy of the sample course outlines and a current, off-the-shelf participant handbook shall be weighted more heavily than cost or price.  (C) The Government may:  (1) Reject any or all proposals if the action is in the Government's best interest; and  (2)  Waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.   EVALUATION CRITERIA.  Criteria 1. Corporate Experience or Past Performance, 60 Points.  Criteria 2.  Personnel Qualifications, 25 Points.  Criteria 3.

<DESC>GSA is announcing its intent to issue procurements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; identification of services, availability and pricing are being requested and individual written solicitations will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation, reference Number 5TS5703R009.  This RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-11.  The General Services Administration (GSA) contracts for local telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers on behalf of various Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within Region 5, The Great Lakes Region, comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Telecommunications requirements are generally satisfied through existing competitive contract vehicles; however, requirements are received by the local GSA Network Services Division field offices that will not be satisfied through these vehicles.  Requirements processed by GSA outside of existing contract vehicles normally include commercially available telecommunications services such as: Centrex service and features, business lines and dial tone services, local area access, and Intra-LATA point-to-point services and related inside wire installation and maintenance.  There may be an occasion for miscellaneous switched services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, or Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.

In instances where work covered by this SOW requires the contractor to work around existing facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for preventing any unscheduled interruption to service or damage to equipment.  The contractor shall be responsible for existing facilities in the event that damage or service interruption occurs as a result of contractor activities.  Required interruption shall be coordinated with and scheduled through the facility manager.  The contractor shall maintain an adequate inspection system and perform such inspections to assure that the work performed under the contract conforms to contract requirements.  The contractor shall inform the Government of all periodic inspections and allow observation.  The contractor shall maintain and make available to the Government adequate records of such inspections.  Tools and Test Equipment.  The contractor shall provide all tools and test equipment required to install, test, and demonstrate compliance.  The service provider may be required to conduct periodic traffic studies to ensure adequate capacity is provided.

In addition, it has been determined this requirement can be met by publication in a national newspaper that meets certain circulation requirements. The USSS is mandated by Congress to publish all administrative seizures in a newspaper of general circulation in all 92 judicial districts of the United States and its territories.  The advertisement must be published in a newspaper once a week for three consecutive weeks.  The purpose of these advertisements is to give notice to all interested parties such as a lien holder or other unknown individuals who may have a vested interest in the property.
