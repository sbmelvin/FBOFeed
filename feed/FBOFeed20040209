White papers are not to exceed six pages plus a title page and must include the offeror’s contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address.  Separate white papers must be submitted for each proposed project and multiple projects cannot be combined into a single white paper.

SPECIAL NOTE:  White papers (first phase proposals) should be submitted on or before November 30, 2003.  The Government expects to complete its review of the white papers and provide feedback to the respondents by January 31, 2004 unless otherwise amended.  Those respondents selected for the second round of proposal development should submit eight (8) copies of each proposal within one month of the date of notification.  

SCOPE:  The transportation sector accounts for about one third of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and one quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Climate change and variability associated with these emissions may also impact the Nation’s transportation system.  Much of DOT’s research to deal with climate change is managed through the DOT Center for Climate Change.  Created in 1999, the Center is a partnership of eight DOT operating administrations (Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Maritime Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Research and Special Programs Administration and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics) and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.  Through strategic research, policy analysis, partnerships, and outreach, the Center promotes comprehensive and multimodal approaches to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gases and to mitigate the effects of global climate change on the transportation network.  Additional information regarding DOT’s Center for Climate Change can be found at http://climate.volpe.dot.gov/. 

Objectives

The purposes of this BAA are to:

·promote research on climate change and transportation in the areas described in this notice,

·establish new linkages within the transportation community on climate change issues, and

·foster successful research partnerships.
	
The research will support the U.S. DOT in understanding and addressing transportation-related GHG emissions, examine innovation in the transportation planning and decision-making processes pertinent to climate change matters, and/or improve knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the transportation sector.  The funding is intended to support research or policy evaluation but not technology development, per se.  However, technology development is an important aspect of transportation and climate change and may be a necessary basis for research analysis.  Many policy issues are relevant to multiple modes, and proposals should take this into account.  Partnering with other organizations (including internationally focused or based entities) and cost sharing with the Center are encouraged but not required.

Transportation-Climate Change Research Topic Areas

The DOT Center for Climate Change is interested in funding projects relating to the following three topic areas.  The specific research issues described under each area are examples only.  Other research ideas are encouraged. 

Impact of Climate Variability and Change on Transportation 
This research will examine the potential effects of climate variability and climate change on transportation infrastructure and services and will identify potential adaptation and mitigation strategies for use by transportation decision makers, infrastructure builders and operators, and state and local planners.  

Examples of research issues:
·Conduct of regional climate sensitivity analysis for the transportation sector.

·Synthesis of existing risk assessment data specific to transportation infrastructure and operations.
 
·Identification of data and analysis gaps for future research.

·Assessment of existing transportation planning tools and their ability to appropriately incorporate climate change data.

·Identification of challenges to marine and inland waterway transportation from changes in precipitation patterns or sea level rise.

Increasing Energy Efficiency and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
This research will examine opportunities for mitigating the GHG impact of the transportation sector.  Projects may consider the potential for conservation through more efficient transportation practices or through new or emerging technologies, the substitution of non-fossil fuels, or other methods.  Research may pertain to any aspect of reducing the sector’s GHG emissions, from increasing consumer acceptance of new technologies to overcoming challenges in technology deployment.

Examples of research issues:

·Examination of economic, social, and institutional factors in transportation energy consumption.

·Identification of options for improving the freight system’s efficiency.

·Identification of transportation “best practices” that reduce GHG emissions.

·Assessment of potential alternative fuels (including diesel) for light or heavy-duty vehicles and the challenges they pose. 

·Assessment of improving incentives to increase operational efficiency.
  
·Identification of challenges to the introduction of advanced vehicle technologies, such as fuel cells.

Decision making Tools and Their Applications and Modeling
This research will focus on developing and improving analytical tools that could support transportation decision making at all levels of government and in the private sector.  Modeling work may involve fiscal instruments and other market mechanisms, vehicle and fuel characteristics, transportation system design and operation, or other research areas.  Energy models currently in use for decision making, such as the Department of Energy’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), represent some important aspects of the transportation sector (e.g. consumer demand and off-highway surface modes); however, they do so at a macro level and operate primarily at the national scale.  Research in this area should provide a better basis for evaluating a broad range of multimodal transportation-related options at different geographic scales.

Examples of research issues:

·Examination of the rate of deployment for alternative fuel infrastructure.

·Development of tools needed to supplement existing tools and processes.

·Improvement of consumer demand reduction and mode selection models to support metropolitan transportation planning. 

·Development of consumer-based models needed to better predict future fleet mixes.

·Modeling of incentive policies to speed the introduction of new, efficient power trains for locomotives, trucks, vessels, or any other vehicles.

·Improvement of availability of GHG emissions data by mode through modeling or other techniques.

·Development of models and methodologies for estimating societal costs and benefits of transportation technologies or policies.

<DESC>Work Description:  This project will consist of the removal of woody debris and structural debris deposited along the Blanco River in Hays County within the City of San Marcos TX.  The initial project area will begin at the junction of the San Marcos and Blanco River and extend upstream along the Blanco River to a point just north and west of Interstate Highway 35.  Materials are located within the channel and floodplain area of the Blanco River and low-lying adjacent areas.  These materials are a potential risk to the downstream environment in event of high flows in the river, are unstable and could restrict normal river flow as plugs, negatively impact public use of the river and provide a substantial fire hazard within the City of San Marcos.  The cleanup operation shall remove these materials and properly dispose of them through chipping, burning, and/or haul off to an approved landfill.  The limits of work will depend on the rights-of-entry granted by private landowners and may extend up to 200 feet away from the Blanco River.  However, any material removed shall adhere to the guidelines that determine which trees, stumps, and brush shall be removed under this contract.  Actual removal shall be as directed by the NRCS and/or as marked in the field.  Only one award will be made for the entire project.  The NAICS Code is 562119.  Performance period will be 66 calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed date, which will be on or about April 5, 2004.  This project is unrestricted.  Price range is from $100,000 to $250,000.  Site showing will be conducted on March 2, 2004, 11:00 A.M., at the Hays County  Court House, 111 W. San Antonio Street, Suite 303, San Marcos TX 78666.  Solicitation will be posted and be available to download on or about February 24, 2004.  Effective immediately, all contractors are required to be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to being awarded a contract by NRCS.  The CCR database is the primary Government repository for contractor information required to conduct business with the Federal Government.  If your firm is already registered in CCR, please provide your DUNS number in Block 14, under Code, in the solicitation.  The DUNS number will be used to verify you registration in CCR.

<DESC>The SubProduct Service Code for this aquisition is 6505; Drugs & Biologicals.  The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to Intentional or natural disasters.  In 2002, the U.S. Congress established the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OASPHEP).  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to prevent, prepare for, and respond to acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population.

The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OASPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of medical countermeasures to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in preparation for response to a public health emergency.  

Description

The nature and degree of the threat posed by the use of infectious agents as weapons of biological warfare have generated increased concern for the safety of the general American populace.  With the deliberate exposure of citizens of the United States including postal workers, and other U.S. Government (USG) employees to Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) spores in 2001, there is an urgent need to stockpile appropriate and effective countermeasures to protect those living in the United States from the harmful effects of B. anthracis spores when used as instruments of terror.  Thus, this enduring threat requires an accelerated pace of anthrax recombinant protective antigen (rPA) vaccine development, testing, manufacturing, and acquisition to provide a sufficient stockpile for emergency preparedness and response. 

Abundant preclinical evidence is available to indicate that vaccination with native protective antigen (PA) and the rPA of B. anthracis adsorbed to aluminum salts generates long-lasting protective immunity in animal models against inhalational spore challenge of the disease.  This immunity is mediated by antibody directed at PA, and preclinical and clinical testing to date indicates that rPA will be an effective vaccine against anthrax exposure.  Although future anthrax vaccines may be formulated to include antigens other than rPA and adjuvants other than aluminum salts, these novel components are not requested because their consideration could complicate and delay approval of the vaccine sought in this solicitation.

The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is the acquisition and maintenance of  75 million doses of licensed anthrax rPA vaccine for the SNS to protect U.S. citizens against inhalation anthrax.  The contractor will also be required to provide an FDA approval letter and accompanying issuance of appropriate license for a BLA for pre-exposure prophylaxis use of the anthrax rPA vaccine in the SNS; provide an FDA approval letter for a BLA supplement for post-exposure prophylaxis use of anthrax rPA vaccine in combination with antibiotics; maintain ongoing quality control/quality assurance monitoring of the SNS stored product and ongoing stability testing over the life of the contract or the expiration date of the vaccine, whichever comes first; conduct special population trials including pediatric and geriatric populations; and produce a minimum of one (1) lot of bulk product per year to maintain cGMP capacity (a warm base) for the production of the anthrax rPA vaccine for the life of the contract.  It is anticipated that multiple indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts for a maximum quantity of  75 million doses of rPA vaccine for the SNS to protect U.S. citizens against inhalation anthrax will be awarded.  However, the Government reserves the right to make one award. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-04-01 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about February 23, 2004.  Responses will be due on or about March 23, 2004.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.  All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-04-01 and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. .

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to upgrade a previously purchased Domzalski Wind Tunnel Model.  The upgrade includes installing twelve (12) proprietary actuators and the associated model changes and upgrades to account for the new devices.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase this unique upgrade and associated services from Domzalski Machine. The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Justification is based upon the fact that the original wind tunnel model was designed and manufactured by Domzalski Machine. Since Domzalski Machine is the inventor of the model, it is the only vendor that has the required CAD files of the model geometry that are needed to ensure compatibility.	The costs of developing the model have already been incurred and these incurred costs would not be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 pm pacific standard time on February 25, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This procurement will provide for the continuation of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase and eventual Full Rate Production (FRP) of the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Program.  FBCB2 is the Armys digital battle command i nformation system at the Brigade and Below level.  FBCB2 provides soldiers and leaders in combat, combat support, and combat service support units at brigade and below with on-the-move, near-real-time Situational Awareness (SA) and Command and Control (C2)  information.  FBCB2 provides SA and C2 information and functionality down to the squad and platoon level across all Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and provides a means for brigade and battalion commanders to lead when away from their Tactical Operati on Centers (TOCs). FBCB2 is a key component of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and interfaces with the Ground Command and Control System (GCCS) found in battalion and brigade TOCs.  The FBCB2 V-4 Applique ruggedized computer system consists of a Central Processing Unit (CPU), keyboard unit (KU), display unit (DU) and Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) using FBCB2 software in accordance with Specification FY04 Applique V4 Spec3.1b 100203.doc.   This specification was posted on 08 October 2003 along with the Market Research Sources Sought notice and the draft solicitation notice on 23 December 2003. (Solicitation No. W15P7T-04-R-G201).  PM FBCB2 entered Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) to ramp up LRIP production capability during 2000 through 2003.  The V-4 Applique computer hardware was procured through the software developer Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (formerly TRW), who subcont racted to two manufacturers of computer hardware during the years of 2000 and 2003.  The Army has successfully implemented its strategy to bring this technology to the field by providing LRIP FBCB2 Systems to the First Digitized Division.   Additional quan tities of the LRIP FBCB2 Systems are required and will be acquired under this acquisition.  This effort will support requirements as documented in the FBCB2 system Operational Requirements Documents and requirements emanating from current Army guidance for  a quantity of up to 11,000 computers, associated spares/accessories and support services for the LRIP/FRP of FBCB2 program.   A Sources Sought Notice for Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) V-4 Applique Computer Procurement posted to the Ar my Single Face To Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page under U.S. Army Market Research Opportunities was published on 08 October 2003, and closed on 24 October 2003.  As supported by the results of the Armys market research and in accordance wi th  10 USC 2304(c) (1) / FAR 6.302-1, this effort will be restricted to a limited competition between the two subcontractors who have previously manufactured hardware for the FBCB2 Systems:  L-3 Communications (L-3) Ruggedized Command and Control Solutions , San Diego, California and DRS Tactical Systems, Inc. (DRS), Palm Bay, Florida.  A Justification and Approval Document has been staffed and approved in support of this acquisition. This effort will be a limited competition, best value source selection to: (1) produce and deliver the FBCB2 V-4 Applique ruggedized computer system directly from only one of the current LRIP manufacturers, as a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Qua ntity (IDIQ) contract during FY04-08; (2) provide for the production of systems necessary to permit an orderly increase in the production rate for the system sufficient to lead to full-rate production upon the successful completion of operational testing; and (3) will transition to become the Full Rate Production contract when the milestone approvals have been obtained to enter into the Full Rate Production Phase of the FBCB2 Program. NOTE:  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit for limited competition, with only two source, und er the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fo rty five days (thirty days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract bas ed upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>TO DOWNLOAD A SOLICITATION PACKAGE FOR NOS. 008, 009, 010, or 011 -M-APHIS-04, GO TO SOLICITATION NO. 008-M-APHIS-04.  The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New York officials, requires four (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Queens, East Queens and Long Island areas of the State of New York.  During the spring of 2004, APHIS anticipates applying control treatments to approximately 113,000 host trees with an estimated 1,400,000 diameter at breast height (dbh)  via trunk injection, estimated 23,000 host trees with an estimated 292,000 dbh via soil injection and 1,300 host trees with an estimated 5,200 dbh via soil drench total in all contract areas.  Control treatment applications are intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.   ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  Requirements contracts will be awarded to ensure contractual coverage is in place in the event additional control treatment applications are required or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, or date of award, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period of each contract awarded.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 30, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>This is a modification to change the response date from May 1, 2004 to March 1, 2004.

This is an invitation to pre-qualify. This is not a request for proposals (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to participate. The U.S. Postal Service, in anticipation of issuing a solicitation for the acquisition of electrical switchgear equipment services (maintenance, testing and minor repairs) for the Postal Service on a national basis, is seeking to pre-qualify a limited number of qualified suppliers. As a result of the solicitation, multiple awards are anticipated. The subsequent contracts will require suppliers to provide the Postal Service with a full-range of electrical switchgear equipment services to all Postal locations in the forty-eight contiguous United States, as well as Alaska, Hawaii and its related islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The contracts will also require suppliers to design and implement cost reduction processes throughout the supply chain, applying the principles of Supply Chain Management (SCM). The preferred method of doing business will be to utilize electronic data interchange (EDI) through the Postal Service’s internal Web-Based Purchasing System, eBuy.  Suppliers will provide and maintain an electronic catalog hosted on the eBuy.  Orders placed through eBuy by Postal buyers will be passed electronically to the supplier, and invoicing/payment will also be accomplished through eBuy using a unique, postal provided, customer delivery address (FEDSTRIP) number. As all Postal buyers do not have Internet access, the supplier will also be required to provide traditional ordering methods including telephone, fax and mail.


Suppliers will be required to submit monthly and quarterly reports and to provide and coordinate all service and client requirements. The contracts will also require suppliers, if not small businesses themselves, to provide a sub-contracting plan that addresses sub-contracting with small, minority and woman-owned businesses. Suppliers seeking placement on the pre-qualified list must demonstrate that they possess the financial, technical, organizational and managerial resources, and have the experience, operational capability, and quality assurance programs necessary to perform a national contract of this size and scope. Only fifty (50) printed copies of the invitation package are available for mailing. The closing date for the submission of the Invitation to Pre-Qualify package will be March 1, 2004. No invitations will be accepted after this date.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation to provide design-build services for access control stations and associated road improvements. This project is called the "Security Perimeter Project" or SPP.
This project includes construction of two new access control stations, significant road modifications associated with the new access control stations, new intersections, a new road to assure access to the ski hill, vehicle barrier and gate systems, modification of some existing road sections, minor demolition of some existing structures, and modification of two existing access control stations. Security systems will be supplied, installed and tested by the University. The successful contractor will be required to supply the necessary utilities and infrastructure to assure proper operation of security systems.
Some existing utilities will need to be relocated. New utilities will be installed for the access control stations and road systems. The new road sections and structures will be designed and constructed to NMSHTD and LANL standards. 
This contractor will be required to develop a detailed traffic control and construction phase plan as part of this project. The majority of this work will impact the daily employee vehicle traffic into and out of the main LANL site, as well as Los Alamos County traffic. The contractor will be required to minimize this impact and control the traffic flow through construction zones. The contractor will be allowed to work off shifts, nights and weekends in order to accomplish this project and minimize the impact to the normal traffic pattern. The University expects the contractor to perform this work in a manner similar to the recently completed "Big I" project in Albuquerque.
The award of this contract is contingent upon the receipt of funding from the Department of Energy. The University intends to award a firm fixed-price contract to the successful design-build firm that best meets the Laboratory's goals and objectives contingent upon availability and approval of these funds.
The project will be designed and constructed under a Design-Build contract with an estimated cost of approximately $12,000,000. Department of Energy "Q" or "L" security clearance is not required for work on this project. However, all contractor employees working on this project must be U.S. citizens. A LANL-issued badge will be required for all construction personnel on site. The Laboratory's Associate Directorate for Operations will oversee the design and construction of the RLUOB.

<RESPDATE>022004
<ARCHDATE>03062004
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The United States Department of Education intends to award a purchase order to procure media services to create audiotapes and web casts for the dissemination of information to Local Education Agencies (LEAs).  In the fall of 2003, the U.S. Department of Education began conducting monthly conference calls to State Education Agency (SEA) Title I Directors in an effort to provide them with an opportunity to learn about and respond to complex issues relating to the implementation of No Child Left Behind (NCLB).  The calls have provided a way for Federal officials to explain the details of the Department's non-regulatory guidance documents as well as the Department's expectations for SEAs.  In addition, Title I Directors and other key SEA staff were given the opportunity to ask specific questions of Federal officials in order to gain a clearer understanding of the Department's expectations.  Consequently, feedback from Local Education Agencies' (LEA) staff to the SEA and Federal officials has highlighted the need for LEAs to receive these same opportunities for communication, information sharing and dissemination.  As a result, in January 2004, the Department completed the production of an audiotape and web cast for LEA Title I Directors and officials.  Using two different vehicles for sharing the production with LEA staff, the Department attempted to reach more than 15,000 invited LEAs.  In order to create a regular system and schedule for communicating with LEA staff, this procurement requests the services of a media production company to facilitate communication between the Department and LEAs.  The contractor shall provide media production services that lead to the creation of up to eight audiotapes and web casts to be available during the months of March, April, May, June, September, October, November, and December.  The tasks to be performed under this procurement include the following:   1)	Film/shoot 6 separate productions at ED or another D.C. location.  Videotape 6 productions at ED or another DC location. No taping session to last longer than 4 hours.   Each production shoot must include two crews equipped with two industry standard electronic news gathering (ENG) kits and a minimum of two videographers.  There should be sufficient lighting, mics, and backdrops for four participants.  Matching cameras must shoot in professional Beta or DV formats.  Audio production should meet industry standards with each participant fitted with an individual lavaliere microphone. Crews should have experience in producing multi-camera shoots.  A/B switched field monitor for matching cameras is also required.  The Department will be responsible for inviting LEA staff to participate.  2)	Edit each videotape in order to create at least one 60-minute audiotape and web cast for each of the 6 shoots (and up to a total of 8 all together).  Edit each production, in consultation with ED personnel, to create separate thematic audio-video segments for presentation on the web.  A separate audio file of at least 60 minutes must be created from the same production session.  3)	Encode each videotape for web streaming.  Each production must be encoded for streaming in Real Media Surestream and Windows Intellistream files.  Each file must contain at least three A/V streams ranging from the lowest bandwidth product of 32 kbps to the highest bandwidth product of 236 kbps.  4)	Create an HTML page to host each web cast.  The HTML page must include stills of participants drawn from video; links to the streaming media segments; and whatever other text information or links ED would like to include.  5)	Host each web cast for up to 4 months each. The HTML page must be hosted on a separate http server.  Hosting of streaming media files must be done on a dedicated streaming media server capable of streaming Windows Media or Real Media, utilizing the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).  6)	Transcribe each web cast for 508 compliance.  7)	Synchronize each transcription to media.  Words from closed-captioning must synchronize with the speakers per 508 requirements.  8)	Prepare quarterly reports for the Department of Education.  9)	Prepare a final report.  TIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES:  1)	Within 5 days of each editing session, the contractor shall submit to the Department an audio only version of the production.  2)	For each production, within 10 days of each editing session, the contractor shall prepare for the Department the web cast and its transcript, including a link to the streaming media and synchronized close captioning files.  
  3)	The contractor shall submit quarterly reports within 10 calendar days after the end of each quarter.  The reports should summarize the major activities and accomplishments during the reporting period and provide information for each project task regarding significant findings and events, problems encountered, suggested solutions, and staff utilization.  The contractor shall specify in the reports the extent to which the project is on schedule.  4)	The contractor shall submit the final report no later than 30 calendar days after the end date of the award.  The final report should include details on the strengths and weaknesses in executing this procurement.  PROPOSALS:  Offerors will propose between 30-40 days of work.  Proposals must contain:
a) A statement outlining the procedural plan to perform each task (no more than 5 pages total); b) The number of days available to perform the work described in this requirement; c) A statement reflecting the vendor's most recent hourly or daily rate of pay; d) A resume showing relevant qualifications and previous related experience; e) A daily rate and total proposal price.  Proposals should be faxed to 202-260-7764 by 5:00 PM EST on February 20, 2004, Attention:  Britt Jung.  The Department contemplates one award resulting from this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Wallops Flight Facility (GSFC/WFF) is seeking qualified sources capable of design, fabrication, integration, and testing of mid-air recovery systems for hypersonic reentry vehicles in support of the Hypersonic Technology Experiments (HyTEx) project.  It is anticipated that performance will be for approximately 18 months in support of the HyTEx Proof-of-Concept mission, with options for up to seven follow-on missions over the next five years. The purpose of the HyTEx project is to develop and implement a low-cost hypersonic test bed for the flight qualification of thermal protection systems, hypersonic flight control systems, sensors, communication systems, and other avionics.  A critical project requirement is the recovery of reentry vehicles for post-flight analysis of experiments.  Each HyTEx mission will consist of the launch of a reentry vehicle weighing approximately 750 pounds on a suborbital rocket launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, atmospheric reentry and hypersonic cruise along a programmed trajectory, parachute subsystem deployment, and mid-air recovery operations being conducted hundreds of miles downrange over open ocean.	The designated recovery point for each mission is anticipated to be no more than 100 miles from land.  NASA will provide helicopters and flight crews for mid-air recovery operations.	Anticipated contract requirements include fabrication of parachute subsystems designed for maximum descent time from deployment at Mach 1.5 and an altitude of 50,000 feet above sea level; fabrication of specialized mid-air recovery hardware designed for integration with NASA-provided helicopters; design and fabrication of back-up water recovery subsystems; integration of tracking avionics on recovery helicopters; delivery of parachute systems for mid-air retrieval testing and training; simulated deployment testing; training of flight and ground crews; mission operational support; design, safety, and training documentation; safety and design review support; and fabrication quality assurance documentation. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<SUBJECT>A -- DoD STTR Program 2004
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) PROGRAM 2004.  Small high-technology firms and research institutions are encouraged to jointly submit proposals to DoD for high quality cooperative research and development to solve the defense-related scientific or engineering problems set forth in the solicitation, especially those concepts that also have high potential for commercialization in the private sector.  STTR solicitation 2004 was publicly released on the DoD SBIR/STTR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Jan 1, 2004.   The 2004 STTR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Mar 1, 2004 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, April 15, 2004.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal.  Five DoD components will participate in the 2004 solicitation – the Department of the Army; the Department of the Air Force; the Department of the Navy; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the STTR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms and research institutions apply first for a phase I award of not to exceed $100,000 and one year, to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a phase II award not to exceed $750,000 for up to 24 months, to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR/STTR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD STTR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms."  Questions may be directed to the SBIR/STTR Help Desk at (866) 724-7457 or Mr. Jeff Bond at (703) 588-8616, or by e-mail: Jeff.Bond@OSD.mil or Ms. Judy Uhl, Contracting Officer at (937) 255-0494, e-mail judy.uhl@wpafb.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of Novel Chelating Agents for the Treatment of Internal Contamination with Radionuclides
<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness is seeking capability statements from organizations with the expertise to develop, test, and manufacture novel chelating agents for the treatment of internal contamination with radionuclides.

Chelating agents are compounds that react with metals to form stable ionic complexes, facilitating urinary clearance of the metal-chelator complex.  The elimination of chelated metals from the body is termed decorporation.  Decorporation is the goal of chelation therapy.  Calcium (Ca-) DTPA and Zinc (Zn-) DTPA are chelating agents currently used to treat internal contamination with transuranic elements of the actinide series.

Military and civilian populations are at risk of internal exposure to particulate transuranic radioactive material from the detonation of radiological dispersion devices (RDD's or “dirty bombs”), as radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons, and as a consequence of nuclear or radiological accidents.  Internalization of particulate radioactive material occurs via inhalation or ingestion or through contamination of open wounds.  The radionuclides in these particles are then absorbed, transported via the blood, and ultimately incorporated into physiologically compatible organs such as bone and liver in a time-dependent manner.  This process constitutes a health hazard because of the continuous emission of radioactivity to radiosensitive tissues and subsequent development of cell death, organ dysfunction, fibrosis, and malignancy.

Ca- and Zn-DTPA, mentioned above, have been used under IND protocols since the 1960’s to treat internal contamination with transuranic isotopes.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has actively collected and reviewed data pertaining to the clinical use of Ca- and Zn-DTPA and has reached the conclusion that the drugs are safe and effective for the treatment of internal contamination with certain transuranic radionuclides (plutonium, americium, and curium).  Although insufficient clinical data exist, Ca- and Zn-DTPA may also be effective in chelating thorium, californium, and other elements in the actinide series.

Ca- and Zn-DTPA have significant limitations, however.  These agents are hydrophilic salts with poor oral bioavailability (approximately 3%) that must be administered intravenously or via aerosol.  They are ineffective chelators of the actinide elements uranium and neptunium and cannot solubilise plutonium hydroxides at physiological pH or remove plutonium from bone salt once it has been fixed.  Their active ligand, DTPA, is not specific for metals of high ionic charge, and the less potent Ca- and Zn- chelates must be used to avoid hypocalcaemia and depletion of essential divalent metal ions.  Most significantly, Ca- and Zn-DTPA do not have activity against other radioisotopes of strategic concern, including cobalt-60, strontium-90, and iridium-192. 

The following characteristics are desirable in candidate novel chelating agents:

1) The ligand should form a stable chemical complex with the radioisotope in question.

2) The complex formed should be specific for the radioisotope and have little affinity for endogenous cations such as Ca+2, Mg+2, Zn+2, etc.

3) The ligand should be able to compete successfully with endogenous ligands whether the latter be in blood or in the systemic target tissues, e.g., liver and bone.

4) The ligand should have a similar physiological dilution space as that of the radioisotope in question.

5) The radioisotope-ligand complex should be a water-soluble, freely diffusible complex that is readily excreted (lipophilic prodrugs targeting specific organs which are then metabolized to the more diffusible forms excretable in urine may have clinical applications in certain settings).

6) The ligand should be degraded or metabolized slowly in vivo compared to the excretion rate.  Otherwise, larger doses of ligand are required.

7) The ligand should have a low toxicity relative to the dose required for efficient decorporation. 

Additionally, in an event where a large number of individuals may have sustained internal contamination with particulate radionuclides, the ability to administer chelation therapy orally would provide significant operational advantages, both in terms of the speed and sustainability of the response.

The respondent should consider the following elements:

1) As an issue of health security, the U.S. government is seeking to encourage domestic manufacturing of novel chelating agents and other radiological countermeasures.

2) Documented history of successful development and licensure of drugs for human use in the United States or Europe is advantageous.

3) The research and development process and proposed manufacturing facilities will need to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA. 

Interested organizations should submit capability statements that contain descriptions of their capabilities and interests as well as their potential development and production plans including a description of their potential or available manufacturing capabilities.  Any perceived barriers – scientific and financial – to the conduct of this work should also be indicated.  The capability statements, along with any supporting documentation, should not exceed 10 pages.

Capability statements and letters of interest will be kept confidential and will help in determining the need for an RFP to support research and development activities and in assembling a potential source list for distribution of any resultant RFP.  This is not a Request for Proposals and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  Submission of any information based on this request for information is purely voluntary.  Please specify, if applicable, the small business size status of your company (See Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 19).  No solicitation is available at this time.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Submit your response via email only to Pete Penny, at pmp7@cdc.gov, Contract Specialist.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of Oral Ca- and/or Zn-DTPA
<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness is seeking capability statements from organizations with the expertise to develop, test, and manufacture derivatives of calcium and/or zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) with improved oral bioavailability and clinical efficacy comparable to the parent compounds.

Calcium (Ca-) DTPA and Zinc (Zn-) DTPA are chelating agents used to treat internal contamination with the transuranic elements plutonium, americium, and curium.  Chelating agents are compounds that react with metals to form stable ionic complexes, facilitating urinary clearance of the metal-chelator complex.

Ca- and Zn-DTPA are hydrophilic salts with poor oral bioavailability (approximately 3%) that must be administered intravenously or via aerosol.  Treatment should begin as soon as possible after internal contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium is suspected/confirmed by first-line treatment teams. Ca-DTPA is most effective during the first 24 hours after contamination.  Some experts believe that Ca-DTPA is most effective if given within 4 to 6 hours of exposure to prevent radionuclide incorporation in bone and other tissues.  Human data support the efficacy of Ca-DTPA in reducing the biologic half-life of transuranic elements even when given days to weeks after contamination, however.  In an event where a large number of individuals may have sustained internal contamination with transuranic radionuclides, the ability to administer DTPA therapy orally would provide significant operational advantages, both in terms of the speed and sustainability of the response.

The respondent should consider the following elements:

1) As an issue of health security, the U.S. government is seeking to encourage domestic manufacturing of Ca- and Zn-DTPA and other radiological countermeasures.

2) Documented history of successful development and licensure of drugs for human use in the United States or Europe is advantageous.

3) The research and development process and proposed manufacturing facilities will need to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.

Interested organizations should submit capability statements that contain descriptions of their capabilities and interests as well as their potential development and production plans including a description of their potential or available manufacturing capabilities.  Development of alternative oral preparations, including oral formulations for pediatric dosing, should be considered.  The respondent should also indicate their willingness and capacity to hold and administer an investigational new drug (IND) protocol.  Any perceived barriers – scientific and financial – to the conduct of this work should also be indicated.  The capability statements, along with any supporting documentation, should not exceed 10 pages.

<SUBJECT>--Request for information for the enhancement of the DoD purchase, travel and fleet charge card capability.
<DESC>PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE Contracting Office Address: Department of Defense Purchase Card Joint Program Management Office, DoD PC Joint PMO, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041 Subject: Request for information for the enhancement of the DoD purchase, travel and fleet charge card capability.  Alternatively, DoD is soliciting information regarding existing commercial card capability for potential pilots and requirements for future competition.  Pilots are defined as testing a concept on a limited population. Background:  The DoD uses government purchase, travel and fleet charge cards to obtain goods and services.  During fiscal year 2003, nearly 145,000 cardholders used purchase cards to make over 10 million transactions for goods and services valued at $7 bil lion.  Purchase card transactions include acquisitions at or below a $2,500 micropurchase threshold as well as payments on some DoD contracts valued at multimillion dollars. About 1.1 million travel cardholders had over 21 million transactions for travel a nd travel related services valued at $2.4 billion.  Additionally, about 5,000 centrally billed travel accounts were used to conduct 3.6 million transactions valued at $1.4 billion.  Travel services normally include air and rail transportation, hotel and mo tel lodging, meals and car rentals.  About 67,000 fleet cards and almost 1 million transactions were made to purchase automotive fuel and maintenance services valued at $27 million dollars.                    Description:  Purchase, travel and fleet cards enable the Department to acquire and pay for goods and services expeditiously with minimal paperwork.  Overall, these card programs have been cost effective and efficient.  Typically individuals will place ord ers over the telephone, Internet or at the point of sale using a card.  Subsequently, ordering and billing information flows through a Bank and an invoice is issued to the ordering activity.  Invoices are certified and payment is made by the Defense Financ e and Accounting Service.  Most of the billing and payment transactions are conducted electronically but the process is not always seamless between organizations both internal and external to the Department.  Travel charge cards are typically provided to i ndividuals to fund all of their official travel expenses.  These cards are individual liability and the Department reimburses the traveler for authorized expenses.  The time to file, process and issue travel reimbursements is an important consideration in the travel charge card program.  The Department also uses government liability travel cards issued to organizations primarily to fund airfare for individuals who are not issued an individual travel card.   More background information on each of these card programs may be obtained at the following websites.

Scope: The information provided should cover the full range of card and card support functions or processes that could be used by the Department to acquire purchase, travel and/or fleet services worldwide.  Respondents may also offer particular information  that would pertain only to a particular Service or community within the Department of Defense as opposed to the entire Department.   Sample Response Outline:  This s ample outline is intended to streamline the effort of the respondent and structure the analysis by the DoD.  Nevertheless, respondents may develop their responses as they see fit.  The response must be covered in 25 or fewer pages.  Respondents who would l ike to be considered for a 60-minute or less presentation should contact this office to coordinate a date at a location in Falls Church, VA.   1.  Briefly describe your concept or alternatives of how to meet any or all of the stated objectives. (25 pages) 2.  Each concept and alternative should describe estimated cost, schedule and performance risks, if appropriate. 3.  Briefly describe your company, products and services, history, ownership and other information you consider relevant. (10 pages) Disclaimer:  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  However, based on the information provided the DoD may move in the direction to acquire such services in the future.  All information received in response to this RFI will be marked proprietary and handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.   Contact Information:  The point of contact (POC) for this information is Mr. Dan Carro, on (703) 681-3417 and at dan.carro@saalt.army.mil, DoD PC Joint PMO, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041.  You may provide this information by mail, n ext day delivery service or e-mail to arrive at the POC by 2 pm EST, March 15, 2004. Statement of Objectives:   -An end-to-end paperless card authorization, issuance and management capability.  The capability may range from a simple to a potential complex set of services that are Department wide or unique to a Service or community within the Department.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, CA, is soliciting offers to purchase a self-contained cabinet style dust collector rated to handle 9500AACFM at 8” W.G. external static pressure. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation reference number is FA4610-04-Q-0002 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation.. This solicitation incorporates Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 421830 and the size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside. Line item 0001 - American Air Filter Arrestall Model AF-75; or equal - Qty 1 each, to include the following specifications: Dust-ladened air enters below the cartridge area, changes direction 90 degrees and flows through cartridge filter pockets. This change in direction causes separation and deposition of larger, heavier particles directly into the dust storage device, reducing the dust load to the filter cartridge. Finer particles are collected on the filter cartridge. Air is channeled by pocket separators directly upward in a laminar flow pattern, gathered by the fan inlet cone, and exhausted by the BI fan wheel through the acoustically lined fan scroll top outlet. Collected dust is periodically discharged from the filter cartridge surface by the high-energy automatic shaker and falls into the dust disposal area below. Overall construction shall be of galvanneal steel for maximum corrosion resistance. The exterior shall be finish coated with a vinyl lacquer. Cartridge and fan access shall be through full height doors with quick opening, flush latches for speed and security. The unit shall also include a ¼” plate motor mounting bracket assembly with lifting lug openings. Standard construction includes external combination weather cover/silencer with drilled outlet for return air connection. Fan shall be backward inclined for non-overloading operation. Fan wheel shall be constructed of aluminum and shall be fitted with a scroll for maximum efficiency and quiet operation. It shall be belt driven by a 30 HP (230/460/60/3) 1725 rppm TEFC motor. Fan motor starters shall be included as part of quotation. Both fan and motor shall be dynamically balanced for smooth vibration free operation. The outlet area shall be lined with a strong smooth fiberglass laminated mat for sound attenuation. This liner shall be designed for temperatures of up to 250 degrees F, and shall meet the fire resistance requirements of NFPA 90A and 90B. Filter Cartridge shall consist of individual pockets sewn from on piece of 8.2-ounce cotton sateen fabric designed to deliver in excess of 99% efficiency by weight on fine industrial dusts. Filter cartridge shall have rigid corrugated separators to prevent pocket collapse and to channel cleaned air in a laminar flow profile into fan inlet cone. Adjacent pockets shall be positioned by steel bars at the top and flat shaker “fingers” at the bottom to prevent mutual blank off and to maintain the dust cake collection area. A total of 6 filter cartridges shall supply 792 sq. ft. of filter area. Cartridge shall be fitted over a galvanized steel locking frame and all separators securely positioned by a galvanized steel retainer resulting in a tight pocket assembly to minimize pressure drop and maximize dust release. Each cartridge assembly shall be locked in place by two lever actuated over-center cam assemblies, which force the steel header frame securely against a ¾”x1.5” neoprene gasket surface. Automatic Filter Cleaning shall be delivered by two (2) horizontal contact systems that shall distribute shaking force throughout each individual filter pocket. Pockets shall be held tightly by flat shaker “fingers” which impart an acceleration equal to a minimum of 7 Gs from motorized ¾ HP eccentric driven shaker assemblies. Operation of the automatic shakers shall be controlled by a solid state printed circuit board UL/CSA approved using a dual timer mode. It shall include an adjustable fan delay cycle and an adjustable shaker cycle. Overall system control shall be designed for initiation by a hand-off auto switch for maximum operator flexibility. Funnel Bottom Design shall include a steed 45 degree funnel terminating in a 12” diameter drum connection device without slide gates or doors to permit immediate down flow of dislodged dust into the dust disposal container. This should be approximately 6’ from the ground to accommodate the 500-gallon plastic trash receptacles used here on Vandenberg AFB. The additional height can be obtained by using longer corner post. Line item 0002 – Explosion vents shall consist of factory installed rear door panels with Brixton spring type latches and guards. Latches are factory set and field adjustable; or equal - Qty 1 each.
