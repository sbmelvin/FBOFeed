<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Health, Safety and Security (HSS) intends to extend the period of performance of contract number DE-AC01-06SA06027 with Science Applications International Corporation Inc (SAIC) on a sole source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support while a new competitive procurement is competed that will replace the SAIC contract. This new competitive procurement will be released under Solicitation Number DE-RP01-08HS07014 which was synopsized in FedBizOpps on February 2, 2007 under DE-RP01-07HS07014.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is October 5, 2007.  The bridge extension will continue the performance period for an initial six (6) month base period, and shall also include two (2) additional three-month option periods.  The bridge extension period of performance for the base period will be from November 19, 2007 through May 18, 2008, the first three-month option period will be May 19, 2008 through August 18, 2008, and the second three-month option period will be August 19, 2008 through November 18, 2009.  The extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time-frame.  To DOE’s knowledge and belief, only SAIC has the requisite number of “Q” cleared personnel with the highly specialized technical experience to ensure that the HSS requirements are met within the required delivery schedules.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to assume the critical, highly specialized technical support without interruption, pending the award and transition of a new contact under the competitive procurement.  The current contract with SAIC ends on November 18, 2007.  THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS SOLE SOURCE BRIDGE EXTENSION.  Interested, responsible sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the Department.

The level-of-effort for the six-month bridge extension is 27,900 Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) and 13,950 DPLH for each of the two (2) three-month option periods.  It is estimated that the level-of-effort will require approximately 30 full-time equivalent personnel.  The Key personnel labor categories are as follows: one Project Manager, one Senior Personnel Security Specialist, one Senior Protective Forces Specialist, one Senior Physical Security Systems Specialist.  The Non-key personnel labor categories are as follows: Administrative Review Vault Clerk, Computer Specialist, Information Security Specialist, Material Control & Accountability Specialist I, Material Control & Accountability Specialist II, Material Control & Accountability Specialist III, Office Assistant III, Office Assistant II, Office Assistant I, Personnel Security Specialist, Physical Scientist, Program Analyst, Psychiatrists/Psychologists, Safeguards and Security Specialist,  Senior Safeguards & Security Operations Specialist, Senior Security Specialist, Security Specialist, Security Technician, Security Transcriptionist, Security Assistants, Senior Ac cess Controls & Alarms Specialist, Senior Classified Matter Protection Control Specialist, Senior National Security Specialist, Senior Systems Analyst, Technical Support Applicant, Transcription/Reporting.  All personnel performing under this effort are required to possess a current DOE “Q” access security clearance.  The Performance Work Statement and the Position Qualifications for the SAIC contract are attached.  Any responding party must provide a capability statement demonstrating its capability of performing the requirements discussed above, which must include the following, as these items are necessary to demonstrate that the responding party is capable of performing the contemplated work without interruption: (1) a statement that proposed personnel are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; or a letter of commitment from personnel that the responding party intends to use to perform the contemplated work who are not currently employed by the responding party, demonstrating that they will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) a chart or other synopsis of the educational and experience qualifications of personnel proposed for the contemplated work; (3) a chart or other synopsis demonstrating that proposed personnel currently hold a “Q” access authorization; (4) a copy of any teaming, subcontract, or other agreement between any parties that would be performing the contemplated work as part of a team; and (5) a certification that the responding party possesses a facility security clearance and complies with the Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence, FOCI program.

THE WORK CONSISTS OF:  Grading, base, cold recycled asphalt base, superpave pavement, drainage, walls, rockeries, and erosion control.  The work also contains shoulder stabilization subexcavation and subexcavation for travel way stabilization.  This will require pavement milling of material above the subexcavation and replacement with a minor hot asphalt temporary surface to protect subgrade during construction activities.  Continuous cold recycled aggregate base will be implemented after subexcavation is completed.  Three segments of the project will be realigned and the remainder of the project will be a 3R, overlay project.  Seventeen approach aprons are included in the project.  Two of these are associated with approach roads to the Kostic private property.  These two roads are constructed to a 4.4 meter total width and at substantial grades.  Day to day operations of a small dairy must be maintained during construction.  Soil erosion protection will be accomplished in part by filter berms used in place of common silt fences.  Hatinger and Wake Creek replacement culverts will be constructed with baffles and pipe anchor assemblies due to the stream gradient and potential for higher water velocities.  Standard underdrains will be constructed both adjacent to walls and in areas of historical ground water problems.  Welded wire faced mechanically stabilized earth walls and rockeries will be constructed on the project.  Existing guardrail will be removed from three locations and new guardrails installed in slightly different locations.  Both back slope anchor terminals and tangent type terminals will be installed.  Two special construction temporary traffic control signs notifying the public of the road?s name and to expect delays will be fabricated in addition to standard signs.  Temporary pavement markings will be required during construction as well as the creation of a temporary single lane bypass where needed to accommodate subexcavation.  Pavement millings placed in the existing ditch and the placement of concrete barriers will be used to facilitate this construction.  Right-of-way monumentation is required on this project.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Sharon B Roberson, Contract Specialist,  504-697-1308; Edward V Wallace, Contracting Officer, 504-697-5594
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans (SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) intends to issue a solicitation limited to educational institutions in the Southeastern Louisiana area  with graduate degree programs related to disciplines described below pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(a)(2)(iii) for advanced research and development projects. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA intends making a single award. The purpose of this contract is to obtain analytical and technical support services from undergraduate and graduate students and faculty at a geographically local educational institution in support of Advanced Research and Development projects on behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana region.  The solicitation will result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for issuing firm fixed priced task orders.   On behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana and South Mississippi region, the winning contractor shall provide analytical and technical support services in the following disciplines: • Electronic, computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics • Computer Science and information systems • Mechanical engineering and fluid mechanics • Geospatial characterization • Data fusion • Acoustical communications • Industrial/organizational psychology • Modeling and Simulation Customers include, but are not limited to: SPAWARSYSCENNOLA; Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education Command; Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; Department of Navy Chief Information Office; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Finance Center. The contract will have a base year and four one year options.  The total estimated value of this contract, if all options are exercised, is estimated to be $50,000,000 using Navy Research and Development funds. FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) states that full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain essential engineering, research or development capabilities by an educational institution.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has determined that such criteria have been satisfied in this acquisition. As the Navy's center for personnel, pay and manpower systems, research, development, test and evaluation, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has a need to establish and maintain a pool (civilian employment and otherwise) of scientists and engineers interested and capable of maintaining systems critical to the Navy and other military customers.  In order to assist in maintaining this pool of capable scientists and engineers, it is essential that future scientists and engineers receive hands-on training and exposure to Navy RDT&E conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA in the disciplines identified above.  It is essential to the Navy, and particularly the activities receiving these services, to maintain a pool of interested and trained engineers and scientists. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA engineers and scientists attest to the impact predecessor contracts have had on the realization of this goal. Many students exposed to these activities via predecessor contracts returned to support these projects or related work either as contractor employees or directly via the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA' New Professional Program. Employing students specifically from academic institutions will address the essential need for innovation in current RDT&E projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA and with its customers.  The SPAWARSYSCENNOLA  recognizes the importance of scientific investigation through the strategic theme of Innovation. Educational institutions are uniquely positioned to assist SPAWARSYSCENNOLA by providing a source of new and innovative ideas borne of scientific investigation in a rigorous, unbiased academic environment. This procurement will assist in maintaining and providing an essential impartiality and currency in science and engineering services that can only be obtained from educational institutions. Theoretical analysis, exploratory studies and experimentation conducted by students of a relatively unbiased educational institution are potentially superior to that of a for-profit corporation, due to the educational institution's interest and dedication to pure research. For-profit corporations focus on direct economic profit-oriented goals, return on investments, and bottom-line profits as opposed to pure unbiased discovery research. The goals of educational institutions include scientific investigation for its own sake, with broad charters focused on learning and discovery of knowledge within a given area. Educational institutions can focus on investigation and learning for knowledge alone, regardless of any return on investment or practical use of the knowledge acquired. This focus, in turn, fosters innovation. It has been the experience of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA that educational institutions are able to support research and development projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA with a continuing infusion of the very latest academic concepts and ideas at a relatively low cost. Because the cost of employing students is relatively low in comparison to scientific staff from for-profit corporations, many budget constrained projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA would benefit with the participation of students. In many cases, the use of students is not just a cost effective means of stretching project dollars; rather, it is an essential means of accomplishing the mission because project budgets cannot accommodate more expensive labor costs. It should be noted that as SPAWARSYSCENNOLA projects directly benefit from the infusion of innovation and knowledge from an educational institution, there are other essential benefits from the relationship. In February 2006, the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a joint report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."  The report identified alarming trends in the state of American higher education in science and technology; for example: • In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in natural science or engineering.  In France, the figure is 47%; in China, 50%; in Singapore, 67%.  In the United States, the corresponding figure is 15%. • There has been a 20% decline in science and engineering doctorates awarded to US citizens or permanent residents between 1995 and 2004. • Estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, and information technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, or 4-year degrees vary. One estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, and information technologists with 4-year degrees, while the United States graduated about 140,000.  China graduated about 290,000 with 3-year degrees in those same fields, while the United States graduated about 85,000 with 2- to 3-year degrees.  Over the past 3 years alone, both China and India have doubled their production of 4-year degrees in engineering while the United States production of engineers is stagnant. Moreover, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has found that the New Orleans area currently has a shortage of experienced scientific and engineering personnel. This contract action is a counterweight to such trends.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA materially participates in multiple projects spanning a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines on behalf of numerous civilian and military agencies of the United States government and private industry concerns.  Much of the work conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA is exclusive to SPAWARSYSCENNOLA.  The unique challenges and opportunities associated with scientific investigation at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA are a significant inducement for students to continue their education in science and technology.  As an intentialconsequence, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA seeks to stimulates and maintain the availability of a critical workforce essential to its mission as a Navy's pre-eminent manpower, personnel and pay information technology support center. In sum, the Navy has a strong interest in establishing and maintaining essential basic engineering and research and development capabilities relevant to Navy applications and interests; therefore, competition shall be restricted to educational institutions in the South East Louisiana region in order to maintain the essential engineering, research and development capabilities vital to the accomplishment of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA missions.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award up to 20 contracts to organizations having the ability to serve as Study Centers for the National Childrens Study (Study).   This announcement is intended to inform interested organizations of a planned Request for Proposals (RFP), of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.

Background information on the Study is available at www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on childrens health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors, both helpful and harmful, that influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The range of outcomes includes, for example, obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  Likewise, a wide range of environmental influences will be examined for their impact on childrens health and development.   These include, but are not limited to air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, soil and dust contaminants, dietary nutrients, dietary contaminants, parental occupational exposures, infectious and allergic agents, genetics and social and behavioral characteristics.   The Studys goal is to better understand the role of how these factors, alone and in combination, affect or are associated with childrens health, disease and development.   The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S.   Enrolled women and, when possible, their partners will be assessed for a wide range of exposures and personal characteristics early in pregnancy or upon pre-pregnancy enrollment.  Monitoring of the mothers exposures will continue throughout pregnancy to birth, and possibly beyond.  The child will then be followed for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures throughout childhood until at least 21 years of age.  

Information will be collected from participants in the Study who reside in one of the 105 locations (counties selected as primary sampling units for the first stage of a multi-stage sampling process). The Study locations are identified on the map and list of Study Locations at http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/.   The information will be collected by Study Centers that perform the data collection activities in the locations or counties.   It is important to distinguish the Study Centers (organizations or institutions engaged in conducting the study) from the Locations (geographic areas, counties) where eligible participants reside. 

In the initial phase of this Study, which was awarded in September of 2005, data will be collected in seven geographic areas in the United States.  Data collection in each of these seven geographic locations is being conducted by a single Study Center, referred to as a Vanguard Center.  Thus, there are a total of seven Vanguard Centers. The Vanguard Centers will begin enrollment of Study participants up to one year prior to initiation of enrollment in the wave 1 Study Locations. 

Additional contracts are needed to establish Study Centers to conduct the data collections in the remaining 98 Study Locations from the original sample of 105 locations (See study locations at http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/) and to engage in developing the protocol for subsequent phases of the Study.  It is anticipated that approximately 15 to 20 contracts will be awarded as a result of this solicitation for data collections in up to 30 additional Study Locations.  Future solicitations for additional Study Centers to cover the remaining locations will be dependent upon availability of funds. 

Offerors responding to this solicitation must demonstrate the ability to conduct the Study in one or more of the 98 remaining Study Locations .  (Contracts have already been awarded for collection of data in the seven Vanguard Locations.) Specifically, offerors must document in their technical proposal, the following:  

1.	Offerors proposing to become a Study Center must propose to carry out the Study at one or more of the 98 previously designated Study locations (see http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/).   
2.	Study Locations (Counties) where a proposing Study Center offers to conduct the study must be located either: a) in the state where the proposing Study Center is located; or b) in a state that is contiguous with the state of the proposing Study Center. The location of the Study Center is considered to be that of the location of the primary institution in the proposal. 
3.	Demonstrate a clear understanding of the complexity of this Study, including the use of complex multi-level sampling strategies for selection of Study locations and neighborhoods within locations from which participants will be recruited; the longitudinal nature of the data collection; the need to collect, process, and ship environmental samples and biologic specimens from multiple sites; and the need to collect interview data from multiple participants including pregnant women, fathers, and other primary caregivers, and children;
4.	Demonstrate an ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings; 
5.	Provide an understanding of the household sampling approach being used in the study and an ability to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficiently large population of women, both prior to pregnancy and during early pregnancy, such that 1000 live births are enrolled in the study over a 4-year enrollment period in each Study Location; 
6.	Provide evidence of the ability to enroll participants prior to conception and early in pregnancy;
7.	Demonstrate the ability to retain and follow Study participants from all socioeconomic groups, including the medically underserved.  [It is anticipated that measurements that require in-person contact will occur at least once in a subset of participants enrolled prior to pregnancy, two times during pregnancy, around the time of delivery, at 6 months, one year, 3 years, 5 years and every 3-5 years until the age of 21 years.  Other remote contacts (e.g. telephone interviews) will occur at more frequent intervals];
8.	Provide evidence of the ability to collect Study specimens and information (biologic specimens and interview data) from mothers, fathers, and offspring; and environmental specimens from the household and neighborhood environment;
9.	Provide evidence of the ability to collect cord blood and placental tissue at the time of delivery;
10.	Provide evidence of understanding and experience in packaging and transporting biological and non-biological samples to a laboratory(ies) and repository(ies) from the Study Center.  (Note: The National Childrens Study, Coordinating Center (CC) will develop standard operating procedures in collaboration with the Study Centers.);
11.	Provide evidence of the ability to perform a standardized examination of the newborn as well as other clinical and neurodevelopmental exams throughout childhood;
12.	Provide evidence of the ability (equipment and expertise available) to perform fetal ultrasounds; Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA); detailed developmental and psychometric assessments; placement, calibration and use of instruments to collect environmental samples, and other measures as selected in the development of the Study Protocol;
13.	Demonstrate previous experience in the implementation of Quality Assurance/Quality Control activities covering the collection of interview data; collection, storage, and shipping of biologic and environmental specimens; and collection of field observational data;
14.	Provide evidence of qualified personnel to oversee and conduct data collections and other aspects of the Study, as outlined above; and
15.	Provide evidence of previous work with a centralized coordination center in the development of protocols and procedures.


Other instructions to offerors include:

1.	Where feasible, offerors are strongly encouraged to propose to be a Study Center for data collection in multiple locations.  There is no limit to the maximum number of locations that an offeror may include in the proposal. However, proposals will be evaluated based on technical merit of which one aspect includes ability to engage relevant community entities within each location.  
2.	The Study anticipates accruing study locations in three waves or stages separated by one to two years depending on availability of funding.   It is desirable to maintain a representative sample as much as possible with each wave of location accrual.   Therefore, in addition to the technical merit of the proposals, geographic distribution and maintaining sample representativeness will be a factor in selection of centers.  
3.	Only one center will conduct the Study at any single location.  Locations or counties may not be shared or split between more than one Study Center; however, organizations and institutions are encouraged to establish partnerships and teams with other entities where appropriate or necessary to establish the strongest capability to perform the Study.
4.	Each newly established Study Center awarded through this procurement will operate on an equal level with the already established Vanguard Centers.  Both the Vanguard Centers and the newly established Study Centers will operate under federal contract guidelines and will be equally accountable to the Program and Contracting Offices of NICHD. 
5.	A pre-proposal conference to answer questions and provide clarification about this solicitation will be conducted on March 7, 2007 at 1:00pm EST.  It will be held in the Washington, D.C. area. The pre-proposal conference will also be a live webcast. The specific location for the conference will be announced with the RFP and on the Study website www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.
6.	Current Vanguard Centers are eligible to submit proposals to serve as Study Centers for additional locations as outlined above.

The Request for Proposals is anticipated to be issued in approximately two weeks. Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement.  The due date for proposals in response to this solicitation is anticipated to be on or about  April 16, 2007.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Elizabeth J. Osinski, Contracting Officer, at eo43m@nih.gov or addressed to Ms. Elizabeth Osinski, Office of Acquisitions, NIDDK, NICHD Branch, Executive Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510,  Bethesda, MD. 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier?6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to facilitate secure voice communication over an existing Iridium satellite system for NATO operations. 

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. 

The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA Plus procedure. In response to this Notification of Intent (NOI), the U.S. Department of Commerce will be nominating to the bidders list qualified U.S. firms in addition to those already identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 580,000 (USD $821,000). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-12419-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

NC3A, as the Host Nation, intends to procure mechanisms to secure the satellite voice communication system already established within NATO operations. Currently Iridium satellite phones have been implemented at the unclassified level. The aim is to add crypto devices/phones utilizing the current solution and establish secure satellite kits. The solution required shall protect information equivalent to Mission Confidential. This requires a NATO approved solution for protection of NATO Confidential information or a solution with equivalent national approval. Users will be from NATO and non-NATO nations participating in NATO missions.

The technical solution already in operation for mobile and static locations is based on portable Iridium satellite phones and fixed Iridium satellite terminals.

The bidder deliverable equipment shall extend/convert the existing kits, already in operation, to secure mode of operations, so from clear voice to secure voice kits. 

This extension shall ensure that all 76 defined key players have secure communication where everyone can reach everyone. Quick delivery is paramount due to operational urgency. 

The security solution must be releasable to all NATO and non-NATO troop contributing nations/units. 

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO RESTRICTED releasable to ISAF. Performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for its facility and for all personnel assigned to the contract.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm
 
With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, firms must be nominated to the bidders list with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Government nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility: 9 October 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: October 2007

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) began a project in 2005 to convert its network database management system (IDMS) to a modern relational management system (DB2).  This project is expected to be completed by September 2007.  The RRB?s body of data was redefined to fit the new DB2 management system.  This resulted in the development of data tables containing data that used to be stored independently in each application.  Some data, particularly identifying information, existed in each separate database, having separate sources and uses.   The new environment houses all the data in tables that co-exist in the same environment, making comparisons easy and apparent redundancy noticeable.  While the conversion itself is expeditious, it does not address the duplicate data which will become very apparent and will counteract the efficiency of the new relational database management system.  The RRB is seeking sources to provide data optimization services which will include, but not be limited to, eliminating multiple representations of the same data, redefining data that is apparently the same but has subtle differences, and documenting the data.  Potential offers should send an e-mail or letter of interest to Ms. Velinda Nix, at U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, Acquisition Management, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, IL, 60611 or Velinda.nix@rrb.gov to be added to the bidder?s list.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-08-AAC-XR-RFI-001
<RESPDATE>110107
<CONTACT>Lance Hannan, Contract Specialist, Phone (850)883-0184, Fax (850)882-3052, Email lance.hannan@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning current High Power Microwave (HPM) source technology capabilities for use as a Counter Electronics payload that would not cause physical damage to buildings or harm to humans. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses of the industrial base for this technology for potential use in future AF weapons systems. The information you provide may be utilized by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy.

Purpose of this RFI is to solicit information on HPM source technology capabilities available immediately, in the near-term, or through technology transition as defined below. All responses should indicate the appropriate timeframe for the solution provided.

Immediate capabilities: Previously developed and are available for use by other commercial or government organizations or agencies.

Near-term capabilities: Currently in development but require less than one year additional testing prior to commercial production.

Transitionable capabilities: Demonstrated at least at a Technology Readiness Level(TRL)-5 and ready to be transitioned through the normal AF acquisition process or through a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration.
The Department of Defense defines TRL-5 as ?component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment?.  Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly.  The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include "high fidelity" laboratory integration of components.
The Department of Defense defines TRL-6 as ?system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment?.  Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment.  Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.

HPM source technologies must satisfy the criteria below to be included in the scope of this RFI:

1. Platform/Mission Compatibility:  HPM source technology properties must be compatible (i.e. fit within existing dimensions) with existing USAF munitions, cruise missile, or UAV weapon system components.  Technology should be shown to be capable of weaponization with an estimated weight, size, and configuration compatible with specific existing or proposed USAF weapons platforms.    The payload solution should allow for the spiral development of different variants.  Payload-platform electromagnetic compatibility issues and approaches should be discussed.

2. Maturity:  HPM source technology should be demonstrated to be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of five (5) or higher based upon actual test data and/or demonstrations.  A technology readiness level of six or higher would be greatly preferred.  Discussion should include, but are not limited to, HPM source performance factors:  prime power, effective radiated power, thermal requirements (i.e., cooling), waveform, and pulse repletion rate(s).  

3. Effectiveness:  HPM source technology must be shown to be effective at producing persistent target effects by citing effects data and analysis showing the technology to be effective against generic electronics in a building which attenuates microwave energy.  Additional analysis and/or data showing power and range (from the building exterior) of effectiveness and probability of effects against target electronics is desired.  

Additionally, the following information is requested (if available) in this RFI to enable the government to better evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of the HPM source technology:  

1. Military Utility:  Any weaponization analysis/studies of the HPM source technology along with potential concepts of employment to show performance, effectiveness, and military utility.

2. Reliability/Maintainability: Any data on HPM source technology reliability and maintainability issues and their potential solutions.

<DESC>Proposals will be sought for the fabrication of multielectrode arrays (MEAs) specifically optimized for use in the NIDCD mission areas of voice, speech, hearing, and balance. Novel fabrication techniques are required for precise and rapid construction of MEAs suitable for use in chronic animal studies, although the materials and fabrication techniques to be developed should be adaptable for eventual use in human subjects. Outside groups will utilize these electrodes in chronic animal studies and subsequently provide requests for specific modifications or refinements in the electrode design and construction. New MEA variations will then be constructed and distributed under this award in order to support cycles of electrode design and testing for neural prosthesis development. Please note that this is not a solicitation, a solicitation is forthcoming.

Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are addressing a range of challenges, including the aftermath of a civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, and the lack of strong democratic institutions.  The region is considered a Foreign Service hardship post ? 30% post differential for Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 

USAID?s Regional Mission for Central Asia (?USAID/CAR?) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and the management of USAID assistance programs.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with offices in Astana, Kazakhstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $90 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy, and health and education.  The Mission works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractors throughout the region.  The Uzbekistan Country Office (UCO) in Tashkent, led by the Country Representative, includes a team of 1 USDH, 2 USPSCs, and 11 local national technical and administrative support staff.   

B. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSTION

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Sharon B Roberson, Contract Specialist,  504-697-1308; Edward V Wallace, Contracting Officer, 504-697-5594
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans (SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) intends to issue a solicitation limited to educational institutions in the Southeastern Louisiana area  with graduate degree programs related to disciplines described below pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(a)(2)(iii) for advanced research and development projects. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA intends making a single award. The purpose of this contract is to obtain analytical and technical support services from undergraduate and graduate students and faculty at a geographically local educational institution in support of Advanced Research and Development projects on behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana region.  The solicitation will result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for issuing firm fixed priced task orders.   On behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana and South Mississippi region, the winning contractor shall provide analytical and technical support services in the following disciplines: • Electronic, computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics • Computer Science and information systems • Mechanical engineering and fluid mechanics • Geospatial characterization • Data fusion • Acoustical communications • Industrial/organizational psychology • Modeling and Simulation Customers include, but are not limited to: SPAWARSYSCENNOLA; Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education Command; Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; Department of Navy Chief Information Office; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Finance Center. The contract will have a base year and four one year options.  The total estimated value of this contract, if all options are exercised, is estimated to be $50,000,000 using Navy Research and Development funds. FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) states that full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain essential engineering, research or development capabilities by an educational institution.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has determined that such criteria have been satisfied in this acquisition. As the Navy's center for personnel, pay and manpower systems, research, development, test and evaluation, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has a need to establish and maintain a pool (civilian employment and otherwise) of scientists and engineers interested and capable of maintaining systems critical to the Navy and other military customers.  In order to assist in maintaining this pool of capable scientists and engineers, it is essential that future scientists and engineers receive hands-on training and exposure to Navy RDT&E conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA in the disciplines identified above.  It is essential to the Navy, and particularly the activities receiving these services, to maintain a pool of interested and trained engineers and scientists. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA engineers and scientists attest to the impact predecessor contracts have had on the realization of this goal. Many students exposed to these activities via predecessor contracts returned to support these projects or related work either as contractor employees or directly via the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA' New Professional Program. Employing students specifically from academic institutions will address the essential need for innovation in current RDT&E projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA and with its customers.  The SPAWARSYSCENNOLA  recognizes the importance of scientific investigation through the strategic theme of Innovation. Educational institutions are uniquely positioned to assist SPAWARSYSCENNOLA by providing a source of new and innovative ideas borne of scientific investigation in a rigorous, unbiased academic environment. This procurement will assist in maintaining and providing an essential impartiality and currency in science and engineering services that can only be obtained from educational institutions. Theoretical analysis, exploratory studies and experimentation conducted by students of a relatively unbiased educational institution are potentially superior to that of a for-profit corporation, due to the educational institution's interest and dedication to pure research. For-profit corporations focus on direct economic profit-oriented goals, return on investments, and bottom-line profits as opposed to pure unbiased discovery research. The goals of educational institutions include scientific investigation for its own sake, with broad charters focused on learning and discovery of knowledge within a given area. Educational institutions can focus on investigation and learning for knowledge alone, regardless of any return on investment or practical use of the knowledge acquired. This focus, in turn, fosters innovation. It has been the experience of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA that educational institutions are able to support research and development projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA with a continuing infusion of the very latest academic concepts and ideas at a relatively low cost. Because the cost of employing students is relatively low in comparison to scientific staff from for-profit corporations, many budget constrained projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA would benefit with the participation of students. In many cases, the use of students is not just a cost effective means of stretching project dollars; rather, it is an essential means of accomplishing the mission because project budgets cannot accommodate more expensive labor costs. It should be noted that as SPAWARSYSCENNOLA projects directly benefit from the infusion of innovation and knowledge from an educational institution, there are other essential benefits from the relationship. In February 2006, the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a joint report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."  The report identified alarming trends in the state of American higher education in science and technology; for example: • In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in natural science or engineering.  In France, the figure is 47%; in China, 50%; in Singapore, 67%.  In the United States, the corresponding figure is 15%. • There has been a 20% decline in science and engineering doctorates awarded to US citizens or permanent residents between 1995 and 2004. • Estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, and information technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, or 4-year degrees vary. One estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, and information technologists with 4-year degrees, while the United States graduated about 140,000.  China graduated about 290,000 with 3-year degrees in those same fields, while the United States graduated about 85,000 with 2- to 3-year degrees.  Over the past 3 years alone, both China and India have doubled their production of 4-year degrees in engineering while the United States production of engineers is stagnant. Moreover, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has found that the New Orleans area currently has a shortage of experienced scientific and engineering personnel. This contract action is a counterweight to such trends.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA materially participates in multiple projects spanning a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines on behalf of numerous civilian and military agencies of the United States government and private industry concerns.  Much of the work conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA is exclusive to SPAWARSYSCENNOLA.  The unique challenges and opportunities associated with scientific investigation at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA are a significant inducement for students to continue their education in science and technology.  As an intentialconsequence, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA seeks to stimulates and maintain the availability of a critical workforce essential to its mission as a Navy's pre-eminent manpower, personnel and pay information technology support center. In sum, the Navy has a strong interest in establishing and maintaining essential basic engineering and research and development capabilities relevant to Navy applications and interests; therefore, competition shall be restricted to educational institutions in the South East Louisiana region in order to maintain the essential engineering, research and development capabilities vital to the accomplishment of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA missions.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   AMENDMENT #1 TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1.  Minimum Specification #2 states; "The system shall include a 3 kW X-ray generator, which shall be contained in a radiation-safe cabinet that can be located on a bench top, and is transportable with carrying handles "  How  are the end users planning to use this portable generator on a laboratory XRD System?  Answer:  The primary purpose for the system is to conduct bench top analysis of powders.  However, the EPA envisions the possibility of linking the XRD to other units, such as a high pressure system, that the EPA  can use to study the effects of supercritical fluids on the synthesis of solid particles.  NOTE:  Specification #2 has been revised to state;  "The system shall included a portable 3 kW X-Ray generator which is capable of being contained in a radiation-safe cabinet, that can be located on a bench  top.  It is an optional item to have a generator that is transportable with carrying handles".     2.  Please explain in technical detail "zero back-lash harmonic gearbox"?  Answer:  Small-scale servo actuators are used for micro assembly applications in many analytical instruments or production  equipment. The EPA needs to have a miniature gear drive system that provides a unique combination of precision, torque capacity and power density. These features have made it the preferred solution in a wide range of machines and devices. The gears can be implemented in a range of miniaturized  servo actuators, which provide zero backlash, excellent repeatability and long operating life. The system shall have a similar gear drive or equivalent system for the Goniometer.   For further information please refer to:   R. Degen, R. Slatter: Hollow shaft micro servo actuators realized with the  Micro Harmonic Drive?, Proceedings of Actuator 2002, Bremen S. Kleen, W. Ehrfeld, F. Michel, M. Nienhaus, H.-D. Stolting: Ultraflache Motoren im Pfennigformat, F&M, Jahrg. 108, Heft 4, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munchen, 2000 R. Slatter, R. Degen: Micro actuators for precise positioning applications in  vacuum, Proceedings of Actuator 2004, Bremen 3. Since fluids are not typically measured by x-ray diffraction please describe the EPA's application requirements?  Answer:  XRD is typically used for powered samples, however, XRD analysis can also be made on a blend of nano-sized and micro-sized  metal particles in a polymer matrix, such as magneto rheological fluids. There are many examples of these applications in the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics. 4. Is this one system for XRF and XRD or is this two separate systems?  Answer:  This is one instrument with dual functions. 5. Is  there a preferred vendor that these specs are written for in this solicitation?  Answer: No, these are the EPA's minimum specifications.    6.  The RFQ does not specify a re-circulating heat exchanger required to cool the X-ray tube.  Does the end user already have one, or was this item forgotten?   Also, a PC/Printer is not specified - will this be provided by the user?  Answer: The re-circulating X-Ray tube cooler is part of the core system needed for operation and shall be provided by an offerer.  A PC/Printer is not part of the minimum specifications and is being listed as an optional  item, per this modification.   Revised:  Offerors shall submit 1 copy of their quotation that references RFQ-OH-07-00192, no later than October 09, 2007 at 4:00 PM (EDT) to Scott A. Fogle, at fogle.scott@epa.gov.  Questions or comments may also be directed to Scott A. Fogle, at 513 487-2049, or at  fogle.scott@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) began a project in 2005 to convert its network database management system (IDMS) to a modern relational management system (DB2).  This project is expected to be completed by September 2007.  The RRB?s body of data was redefined to fit the new DB2 management system.  This resulted in the development of data tables containing data that used to be stored independently in each application.  Some data, particularly identifying information, existed in each separate database, having separate sources and uses.   The new environment houses all the data in tables that co-exist in the same environment, making comparisons easy and apparent redundancy noticeable.  While the conversion itself is expeditious, it does not address the duplicate data which will become very apparent and will counteract the efficiency of the new relational database management system.  The RRB is seeking sources to provide data optimization services which will include, but not be limited to, eliminating multiple representations of the same data, redefining data that is apparently the same but has subtle differences, and documenting the data.  Potential offers should send an e-mail or letter of interest to Ms. Velinda Nix, at U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, Acquisition Management, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, IL, 60611 or Velinda.nix@rrb.gov to be added to the bidder?s list.****Attachment 2 ?IT Technology Overview/Enterprise Architecture? will not be posted as an attachment due to potential sensitive information it contains.  For an overview of the RRB?s current information technology architecture, please contact me on your company?s letterhead requesting this information.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

The Government may use the services of Omen Inc., Scitor Corp, Teknoworks, Booz Allen and Hamilton, Northrop Grumman-TASC, Mitre, and CMU Software Engineering Institute personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET (TS), or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to the appropriate level of information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY.  Prior to award, the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<SUBJECT>A -- Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) ?C Coordinating Center
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NIH-NHLBI-HC-SS-09-04
<RESPDATE>103107

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking small businesses with the capability to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC) for a new nine-year multicenter clinical trial, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).  SPRINT is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial testing the effects of intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Approximately 7,500 participants will be randomized into either the lower SPB goal of <120 mmHg (intensive treatment group) or the standard SPB goal of <140 mmHg (control group).  Participants will be 55 years or older with SPB >130 mmHg and at least one additional CVD risk factor.  Only two high risk groups will be excluded.  Those patients with diabetes and those who have had a stroke because they are the target groups of other ongoing NHLBI and NINDS trials that are testing a lower BP goal.  SPRINT will focus on three other high risk groups:  patients with clinical CVD other than stroke, patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients without clinical CVD who have other CVD risk factors such as low levels of HDL.  In SPRINT, there will be a subgroup of 3,500 people with stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2).  The primary composite endpoints will be CVD mortality and non-fatal MI, stroke, and heart failure.  Several secondary outcomes will be examined, such as markers of renal functioning in non-CKD participants, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.  It is possible that the study may be expanded to include additional secondary clinical endpoints, or additional treatment strategies to achieve the standard and lower SBP treatment goals.

There will be a one year protocol development phase, followed by the recruitment of participants over a 2 year period.  Participants will be followed for a total of four to six years.  Post follow-up there will be a two year period for close out, analysis, reporting, and dissemination.  Data to be collected includes demographics, medical history, physical examinations, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs), as well as psychosocial, economic, and lifestyle questionnaires and data.  SPRINT will include 4 to 6 Clinical Center Network (CCN) hubs, with approximately 30-45 clinical sites per hub, which will be solicited under a separate request for proposals (RFP).  Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants.  In addition, it is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT:  a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed.  The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Coordinating Center will: 

1)	be responsible for the statistical design of the study and provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for randomizing study subjects, for study monitoring, and for the management and analysis of study data;
2)	develop operational and analytical methodology; provide administrative guidance, oversight, and support for SPRINT as a whole;
3)	coordinate protocol writing activities, including protocol drafting and finalization; develop, design, and distribute study forms and a manual of operations; ensure that the provisions of the manual of operations are carried out by the CCNs and the clinical sites; 
4)	establish the Drug Distribution Center (DDC) and two core laboratories:  the Central Laboratory and the ECG Reading Center; the DDC will package, label, and dispense drugs according to the study protocol and will also monitor compliance and provide data to the CC for further analyses; the Central Laboratory will arrange for the analysis of blood and urinary measurements, provide interpretation of blood measurements, and collect and store blood samples for biomarker and DNA analysis; the ECG Reading Center will provide a central interpretation laboratory of resting ECG; core laboratories will be responsible for developing and distributing specific measurement procedures, timely data gathering, analysis under the leadership from the CC, and providing data to the CC for central analyses;
5)	maintain quality control at participating Clinical Center Networks (CCN), and monitor their performance status; promote interactions among the CCNs, coordinating study activities among the CCNs and core laboratories, and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; train CCNs and core laboratories in standardized protocol implementation and data collection; provide rapid feedback to the CCNs and core laboratories on the quality of data submitted and proposed corrections; conduct periodic visits to each CCN in order to monitor and assure high performance throughout the trial;
6)	make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair and to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 
7)	coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the DSMB and other meetings related to the conduct of the overall trial;
8)	facilitate communications among all organizational study components during each phase of the trial, including the Protocol Review Committee (PRC), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and trial-wide subcommittees, such as the ancillary/substudy, mortality/morbidity, operational, publications, and adherence subcommittees; prepare and distribute minutes and reports of the Steering Committee, Executive Committee, PRC, and DSMB meetings, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data collection and report content;
9)	establish and maintain a computer system, secure database, and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data (including blood samples and ECGs) collected from up to 120-180 separate clinical sites; also provide for the central interpretation of quality of life and costs data collected on subsamples of participants;
10)	develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of SPRINT information, documents, and forms to the CCNs; develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about SPRINT for the lay public;
11)	prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating CCNs, the project officer, the contracting officer, and others identified as key partners by the project officer;
12)	review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy, addressing such issues as recruitment progress and certification of new clinical sites;
13)	monitor end point results, morbidity and mortality data, and adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study; and
14)	design and implement a plan for study closeout, analysis, and dissemination, including final data collection, verification, analytical support for scientific writing groups,  publication of study results, and plans for the investigators?? dissemination of study results. 

The CC will frequently need to make complex and rapid decisions and assist the study leadership and the DSMB in their decision-making process. These decisions will often be based on medical information obtained from the clinics and developments in the scientific literature and other sources of information, such as the FDA.  Therefore, CC staff will need to be highly experienced, with strong medical and scientific qualifications and credibility, and have specialized experience relating to hypertension, clinical cardiology, and nephrology.  The CC must have biostatistical and information technology expertise, including the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, economic, and medical morbidity and mortality data, and to develop and maintain a complex website and computer system.  CC staff must be experienced coordinating several long term, complex, large scale, multi-site clinical events trials lasting more than four years.  This experience should include managing subcontracts with a DDC or core laboratories.  The medical monitor for the CC should be board certified in internal medicine with substantial experience in the clinical management of hypertension, and have significant experience in large scale multi-site events clinical research trials.  The CC must develop highly productive working relationships with the CCNs, core laboratories, academic researchers, NHLBI Project Office, advisory groups (e.g., DSMB), and clinical sites.

<DESC>Amendment  #1 to Sources Sought Notice # YA1323-08-PB-0001

The purpose of this amendment is to amend the Sources Sought Notice posted in FedBizOpps on September 20, 2007, to incorporate answers to questions received from prospective Respondents.   The closing response date remains unchanged; 2:00p.m., Thursday, October 4, 2007.

1.	Item 1-a.
How is ?single integrated unit? defined; are all necessary components to be contained in a hardened case?  

ANSWER: Yes ? all components should be contained in a single case.

2.	Items 1,2,3
The delivery schedule implies that the first delivery of 75 units will be of existing systems while the second delivery implies a 'new' single integrated system shall be delivered as a prototype.  We assume that this prototype will be refined for the final deliverable.  Is this position statement correct?   

ANSWER: Yes ? the first 75 are for our dress rehearsal operations for early 2008 and the prototype will be refined for 2009 and beyond operations.
 
3.	Item 5- Availability of on-site training.
Where is this training to take place?  How many training sessions will take place? Over what time period is the training to be held?  Are there multiple locations for training or at a Census Bureau central site? 

ANSWER: All training sessions will occur at Census Headquarters in Suitland, Maryland.  We will need training in October 2007 and again in January 2009.  We anticipate at least 2 training sessions in 2007 and two additional sessions in 2009.

4.	Item 7-d.
Are the fingerprint records required to be stored as encrypted EFT records?  

ANSWER: Yes ? both transmitted EFT and stored EFT are required.

5.	Item 8-b.
Do the terms ?primary and alternate destinations? refer to the need to switch the cellular service being used, or to utilization of multiple channeling mechanisms?  If the latter, what channeling mechanisms does the Census Bureau anticipate using? 

ANSWER: We will request a primary IP address for sending these EFT files and a backup IP address if the primary is not available.

6.	Does the Census Bureau envision any other application running on the live scan system computer?  For example, will reports be generated on these computers and will a contact database of any type be maintained on the system (outside of the demographic data for the fingerprint records)?  

ANSWER: We will need the ability to run ad hoc reports from the device.  These include how many files where transmitted from a particular location on a particular day for this device and overall how many EFT files have been created for each device.

7.	In order to expedite a 10/31 delivery should the responders prepare and submit an unsolicited proposal or quotation to facilitate that action?

ANSWER: No
 
8.	Please verify this interpretation of your intent, to purchase 75 units of COTS equipment that is as close as possible to the specifications for immediate use in the 2008 rehearsal and then purchase 3 prototype units that meet the detailed specifications for the 2010 census.

ANSWER: Your interpretation is nearly correct; the 75 units must meet the exact specifications.  In addition, the first 75 are for our dress rehearsal operations for early 2008. The 3 prototype units will be refined for operations in 2009 and beyond.

<DESC>NOTICE:     THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.
The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the business size and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  All firms qualified, capable, and interested, without restriction to size standards, should submit the requested information.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified business concerns able to will provide technical and scientific support to NOAA, Office of Response & Restoration (ORR) on an as-needed basis.  There are four major tasks required in the proposed contract:  A) Incident Response & Incident Response Preparation, B) Training, C) Research and Development, and D) Analytical and Laboratory Support.  

The proposed Contractor shall provide support on both an emergency and non-emergency time frame.  A higher percentage of effort will be for non-time critical support, but the ability of the contractor to respond quickly during an emergency event is critical to ORR?s mission and paramount to the fulfillment of the contractor?s obligations.  The focus of the technical and scientific support is chemistry related issues during hazardous material and petroleum spills, but ORR may support all hazards missions such as disaster responses and port security contingency planning issues that involve chemical risks.  The contractor shall provide augmented support to ORR staff scientist and Scientific Support Coordinators.

Task A ? Perform 24-hr., 7 days a week (24/7) spill response.  Must respond to calls from ORR within one-hour of the initial contact and be able to provide support directly by verbal consultation or have access to the resources required to investigate the request and provide follow-up communications both verbally and in writing.   Provide oral and written reports as required, reflecting information or specific support requested.  A common request will be a concise assessment of the hazards associated with the spilled chemical, the transport and fate of the chemical relative to the specific incident environment, and any unique or scenario-specific concerns.  Such reports are generally defined as Chemical Hazard Assessments rather than risk assessment since they identify threats rather than probability.   Other emergency requests might include recommendations for sampling or a review of proposed sampling and/or analytical protocols, or to recommend or review mitigation techniques.  The general protocol for such support is to provide an initial oral report or discussion that is followed by written documentation (a report) that is electronically submitted a couple of hours later.   The proposed contract will also be required to perform On-Scene Response Support, requiring travel to the site of the incident to provide direct consultation and technical/scientific support to federal response personnel and cleanup personnel on issues related to chemistry.  In addition to direct consultation, field support activities may include field monitoring, sampling, and assessments.  If the situation requires and a request is made, the contractor must be in route to the site of the emergency within 24-hours of request.  Most incidents occur within the coastal regions of the U.S. and its territories, but international travel has occurred in the past.  The contractor shall maintain the ability to respond internationally if requested.  The contractor shall contribute to spill preparedness activities including drills and the production of spill response planning documents such as Area Contingency Plans as requested.  The contractor?s role shall include the assessment of the hazards associated with chemicals that might be released into the environment.

Task B - The proposed contractor shall develop training materials and conduct training and workshops as requested.  Training may be requested as part of planned activities across the U.S. and its territories or at the contractor?s base of operations.  On rare occasions, a workshop or training activity will require travel outside of the U.S.

Task C - The proposed contractor shall provide technical support in the area of chemistry as required to support ORR in its mission critical activities.  This may require the contractor to develop, manage, and perform research projects, as well as contribute to the projects managed by ORR personnel.  The following represents possible assignments: design and conduct experiments and field test to further the scientific knowledge of the chemical hazards in the environment; development of measurement technologies to detect and quantify dispersed oil; evaluate alternative spill response countermeasures such as solidifying agents.  Results from these efforts shall be documented in written reports and publications, and may influence ORR response and restoration strategies.

Task D - The proposed contractor shall provide analytical support for the analysis of environmental samples contaminated with petroleum and/or petroleum products to determine the relevant physical characteristics, short-term fate, and apparent toxicity of the oil based on the relative distribution of PAH.  Analytical support may extend into the identification of other chemical pollutants or unknowns, but will not extend to the analysis of any known highly dangerous samples that would be outside the scope of work for a typical commercial laboratory. The proposed contractor must be able to assess the quality of the data from the chemical analyses provided and interpret the results in terms of its implications to operational decisions.  Emergency response may require time-critical analytical support for a limited number of samples and may require completion of the requested analyses and preliminary reporting within 24 hours of sample receipt.  Non-emergency analytical support that is associated with ORR research activities and natural resource damage assessment surveys will have task-defined schedules.  Environmental samples may include water, sediments, and animal tissues.  Routinely requested laboratory support functions are as follows:  
-Chemical characterization and compositional analysis of reference oils and spilled oil samples by GC/MS.  Compositional analysis would include the quantification of selected alkanes and PAHs common to oil and typically monitored during oil spill events.
-The proposed contractor must understand oil chemistry and posses the ability to interpret analytical data such that a fingerprint determination between an unknown and reference to determine if they are derived from a common source.
-The laboratory support element must include the ability at assess key physical property data such as density and viscosity of reference and spilled oil samples.
-Assess a spilled oil?s applicability to the application of chemical dispersants. 

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price, labor hour or time-and-material task order IDIQ type contract will be for the eventual solicitation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 M.   All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  No solicitation document is available.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, BUSINESS TYPE AND SIZE, and a brief narrative regarding its capability to provide the required services.  The following is the information that must be addressed in the response to assist the Government in determining the availability of qualified small business concerns for the requirement:
Demonstrate relevant experience, expertise, and qualifications of key personnel in the basic design system and deployment of the system.  It is the Government?s intent to analyze responses from firms which can operate in the areas of consideration as specified above.   Detailed information must be submitted by mail to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, WRAD, 7600 Sand Point Way N.E., Seattle, WA 98115-6349, ATTN: Sharon S. Kent, or to the email address below by 12:00 noon, October 9, 2007.  Questions of any nature may be addressed in writing to Sharon.S.Kent@noaa.gov.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.     Submission information will be reviewed by the Government to determine the level of competition, i.e., small business set-aside, full and open competition.

<SUBJECT>13--Next Generation Countermeasure (NGCM)
<SOLNBR>N0002408R6250
<RESPDATE>110107
<CONTACT>Christina Trasferini, Contract Specialist, christina.trasferini@navy.mil; Thomas Duval, Contracting Officer, thomas.duval@navy.mil
<DESC>This sources-sought synopsis is issued in anticipation of a future procurement program.  The Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine interest in the development of the Next Generation Countermeasure (NGCM), an acoustic torpedo countermeasure device for use by the US Navy.  NGCM will replace in the future the Acoustic Device Countermeasure (ADC) MK 2 and ADC MK 3.  The objective is to insert new countermeasure technologies into the submarines defense against threat acoustic-homing torpedoes. The NGCM is a three-inch diameter by 39.5 inch in length expendable, submarine launched acoustic torpedo countermeasure with advanced features, which can be, employed either as a static or mobile device. The NGCM will use Smart Adaptive Countermeasure (SACM) technology to provide variable acoustic modes of operation, including the ability will listen to an attacking torpedos ping and then optimize the interference signal it sends back to the torpedo. The NGCM shall have higher source levels then the existing ADC MK 2 MOD 3 acoustic torpedo countermeasure with the same range of frequency operation.  The NGCM will have both a hovering and mobile mode.  Hovering devices can act as stationary broadcast jammers while mobile units can additional be launched with more decoy like modes.  The NGCM is intended to be launched initially from a submarine internal signal ejector, and additionally in the future via the external countermeasure launcher. The NGCM shall have an attitude swit!  ch to prevent accidental activation as well as safety interlocks similar to the ADC MK 2 and ADC MK 3 torpedo countermeasure to prevent accidental activation.  The countermeasures (CMs) will have receivers capable of operating in full duplex mode. The NGCMs will be totally software re-programmable via an external interface and will be capable of changing tactics or modes of operation in response to perceived tactical or environmental conditions based upon software programmed tactics.   Operational modes of the NGCM shall include the current acoustical modes of the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 and ADC MK 3 MOD1 devices, as well as have a Smart Adaptive Countermeasure (SACM) mode which is a more advanced reactive mode of acoustic operation. Additional features of the NGCM shall include: a. The NGCM shall have the acoustical operational modes of the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 and ADC MK 3 MOD 1, as well as the SACM mode.  In addition, the NGCM shall be totally programmable in acoustical operational mode with the ability to program new signal response types and modes and any blending of the acoustical modes. b. SACM PROCESSOR   The SACM adaptively responds with structured false alarm jamming signals to intercepted threat waveforms on a ping to ping basis in real time.  The structured false alarm return is an analytically recreated waveform based upon the intercepted threat waveform which has been Doppler shifted and modified with a hi-light structure.  The intent of the NGCM effort is to make this processing technique and its associated electronics tied to the sensors, propulsion engine, and a classifier with pre-programmed responses to provide data for tactical decisions and countermeasure actions/commands.  The classification concept is based upon using clues extracted from the threat waveform by the SACM processing algorithms to identify the specific threat intercept and then using a look up table to formulate the best jamming response and tactic to neutralize the incoming threat. Current clues extracted include waveform type, bandwidth, duration, and tolerances. c. Tactical Processor - The NGCM shall utilize programmable presets, including timing, depth, and acoustic signal modes and related parameters, as well as programmable parameters related to the mobility of the device.  All software within the NGCM including the SACM mode and classifier will be totally programmable.   d. The NGCM shall also have a digital table with an adjustable TVR equalization, allowing the NGCM to have calibrated transducers for each electronics board set to optimize or flatten the source level outputs.   e. The NGCM shall have full duplex operation, with the ability to attenuate the NGCM active transmissions and reject NGCM motor noise. A receiver capable of full duplex operating mode (simultaneous receive/transmit) will enable real-time adaptability to the transmitted threat signal.  f. The NCGM will be designed to the same dimensions as the current ADC MK 2, and will be launched from the same launchers that currently launch the ADC MK 2 (submarine signal ejectors.)  In addition, the NCGMs in the future will have the ability to be packaged in an all-up canister that can be launched from the external countermeasure launchers on submarines. g. The units will have a default operational mode, for backup, that will enable them to be launched using the existing launch control interface or via external switches set manually prior to launch via the internal signal ejectors. h. The NGCM mobility will include variable speeds from slow to fast with sufficient control and control surfaces to enable the transition from mobile to hovering operation.  Controlled CM mobility in transit as well as hover modes will enable more effective positioning of the CM. The NGCM in the first iteration shall have a programmable guidance system that can be programmed at the ISEA or prior to loading onto the submarine with a pre-programmed run pattern.  The NGCM shall be able to move and turn in accordance to pre-programmed maneuvers including variable depth transitions.   i. The NGCM shall have hovering modes comparable to the programmable depth settings of the ADC MK 3 MOD1 as well as external switches that can be manually set such as with the hovering switches of the ADC MK 2 MOD 3. j. The NGCM will have operational endurance similar to the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 device. k. The NGCM will be able to generate source levels in excess of the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 device, and in the SACM modes, source levels in excess of the ADC MK 3 MOD 1 device in the torpedo frequency band for both wide band and narrow band operation. l. The NGCM, both in hovering or mobile mode, must have the same ability to clear the submarine and not cause impact upon the submarine after launch nor have any launch debris fall into the submarine similar to the launch clearance and debris requirements of the ADC MK 2 and ADC MK 3 devices. m. The NGCM, if using a towed hydrophone to achieve full duplex operation, shall be able to maintain full duplex operation after a mobile to hovering transition. n. The NGCM, including any possible deployment mechanism and towed hydrophone, must survive launch transients and shock and vibration requirements similar to the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 for the first iteration of devices. o. The NGCM should have acoustical activation and hovering / mobile activation time lines similar to the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 device. p. The NGCM shall have software scuttle features to ensure security of the device similar to the ADC MK 2 MOD 3 device. q. The energy system (battery) of the NGCM shall meet the same Sub-Safe and submarine certification requirements as the ADC MK 2 MOD device. r. The NGCM will have a combined stowage and shelf life of 14 years or more.  The device shall be designed and manufactured with the ability to provide mid-life service with the replacement or refurbishment of parts with expiring shelf life.   s. The NGCM shall be programmed to have a self-check feature to include built in test features that provide go / no-go status.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary that does not exceed five (5) pages in length describing their NGCM design concept and firms recent relevant business experience and their approach in meeting the requirements stated above.  Responses should include: (a) The name and address of the contractor and where the NGCM would be built; (b) Point of contact including name, title, phone, and email addresses; (c) A description of similar devices currently offered by the contractor that meet, or with minor modifications might meet, the above listed requirements.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DESIGN AND BUILD SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE IDAHO CLEANUP PROJECT'S SODIUM/NAK TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR THE REMOTE WASTE DISPOSITION PROJECT.----CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site near Idaho Falls, Idaho.  CWI is seeking qualified businesses that have thorough knowledge, experience and resources to provide management and execution of design and build services for sodium (Na) and sodium/potassium (NaK) waste treatment process for treating remote-handled (RH) Low-Level Waste (LLW) and Transuranic (TRU) waste contaminated with residual or bulk amounts of elemental Na or NaK. The treatment process equipment will be installed by CWI with subcontractor technical support and operated remotely by CWI in an existing shielded hot-cell at the INL.  Considerable quantities of RH waste are stored at the INL Site. In accordance with federal and state legal and regulatory requirements, this waste must be processed and repackaged in preparation for final land disposal. Because capabilities to process RH waste do not currently exist at the INL Site, the Remote-handled Waste Disposition Project (RWDP) has been proposed to provide this capability. The mission of the RWDP is to open, segregate, characterize, treat, repackage, and ship for final disposition RH waste from more than 900 waste liners. --Waste components that are Na contaminated may not be directly disposed of without removal of the Na metal and/or NaK. Much of the Na contaminated waste is suspected to have limited (i.e., residual) quantities of sodium or NaK, while a few of the waste liners contain larger quantities of Na or NaK. The Na/NaK inventory is approximately 1500 gallons of Na and 100 gallons of NaK. Most of the inventory (~80%) is associated with eight Na cold traps.  ----This is a sources sought announcement designed to identify and qualify potential sources interested in this project. This announcement is not a solicitation. Companies who submit a qualified response will be maintained on a list as sources for a possible future solicitation. It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued approximately Summer 2008. ----Respondents' pre-qualification submittal packages shall include the following: 
1)	PROJECT EXPERIENCE:    a) List at least two similar projects that respondent has performed during the last five years.  The listed projects must be similar in scope and involve work of similar complexity as the work covered by this notice.  b) For each project listed provide i) client name, and name, title, email and telephone number of the client point of contact, ii) dollar value, iii) description of respondent's scope, and iv) contract type and dates of performance.  The client point of contact must be able to address respondent's performance.
2)	FINANCIAL CAPABILITY:  Provide respondent's Annual Report or current audited financial statement and current quarterly financial statement.  (Only one copy of the financial documents is required.)
3)	QUALITY PROGRAM:  Provide a copy of the table of contents of the respondent's Quality Assurance Program (QAP). The respondent must have an established NQA-1-2000 or newer quality assurance program.
4)	SUBTIERS:  If respondent will have subtier subcontractors, the scope that each subtier is proposed to perform must be identified and the applicable backup documentation identified in Items 1 through 3 above must be provided for each subtier. ----Submittal packages must be limited to 50 pages, however, financial documents are not required to be included in the page count.  For the sake of consistency, structure your submittal to match the order of the 1-4 submittal requirements as listed above and use standard 3 ring binders. ----TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED----QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY EMAIL to james.alberico@icp.doe.gov---As solely determined by CWI, the omission or failure to correctly and satisfactorily respond to any pre-qualification criterion as required above may result in the respondent's elimination from further consideration.----INTERESTED SUBCONTRACTORS SHALL SUBMIT four (4) hard copy submittal packages to: Jim Alberico, CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC, Idaho Cleanup Project, P.O.

<SUBJECT>R -- Alternative Fuels Initiative (AFI)
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number DTPH56-08-Q-000001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses which are in effect through the most current Federal Acquisition Circular.  Applicable FAR clauses are incorporated by reference.  The requirement is being solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-aside using Simplified Acquisition Procedures per FAR Subpart 13.  A Firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated.

The President of the United States has established a goal of reducing the Nation?s dependence on oil and, as one means of doing so, of increasing the percentage of alternative energy products consumed. In order to accomplish this goal, the existing hazardous materials transportation delivery system must be developed or modified. The Department of Transportation (DOT) must be involved in addressing this challenge, and within DOT, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for developing transportation options for alternative energy products.  

In order to develop appropriate policies, PHMSA has implemented the Alternative Fuels Initiative (AFI).  The purpose of the AFI is to identify various options for transporting biofuels and other alternative fuel sources via pipeline and other transportation modes by sponsoring research and development, resolving technical issues, conducting alternatives analysis, and developing a strategic roadmap for program and policy implementation.  In addition, PHMSA is undertaking efforts to ensure that proper emergency response procedures and resources are in place to deal with the unique properties of biofuels and other alternative fuels.  PHMSA, as the DOT agency with regulatory authority over the safe and reliable transportation of hazardous materials by all modes, including pipelines, will have a key role to play in the development and use of biofuels and other alternative fuels.  

PHMSA requires a Consultant to provide research, analysis, and planning services in support of PHMSA?s AFI.  To assist PHMSA with this initiative, the Consultant must have a combination of industry and governmental experience, relationships with industry and legislative stakeholders, and knowledge, abilities and perspectives on energy policy.

<SUBJECT>A -- Follow-Up of the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children w/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA)
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, one award to each of the seven clinical sites identified as the MTA Group. The MTA Group consists of the following: (1) NYU Child Study Center, NY, NY; (2) New York State Psychiatric Institute, NY, NY; (3) University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA; (4) University of Pittsburgh, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA; (5) University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA; (6) McGill University, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada and (7) Duke University, Durham, NC. Each award will consist of one base year and four, twelve-month option years. These contracts will allow for an extended follow-up on the subjects who participated in the initial MTA study and the normative control group by providing for the collection of follow-up data, the transfer of that data to a data management center and recommendations about which statistical analysis to conduct on the follow-up data collected. As ADHD is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, it is important to collect long-term data on the effects of treatment. The MTA Group offers a unique opportunity because it contains a large number of well diagnosed and characterized children who were randomly assigned to receive different treatments for an extended period of time, and a matched control group, at different geographical sites. The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the MTA Group or 7 sites) is 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and HHSAR 306-302-1(a)(2)(ii). The MTA Group has unique capabilities to perform the services required by this acquisition. Foremost, this Group has access to a large number of children who have been treated for ADHD in a controlled trial. Over the past eight years, these sites have worked to recruit, evaluate, and treat a large sample of children with ADHD, a matched control group, and their families. The investigators, at these sites, have established and successfully maintained over the years therapeutic relationships with these families and their children. The investigators have remained in contact with most of the study participants through periodic re-evaluations. Considering the unique personal and treatment relationships that have been established over time between the investigators and these families, it is not feasible to have another contractor go through the process of establishing new working relationships with these families in order to collect the necessary follow-up data. Based on historical data from other studies, it is known that a large number of families would not participate in a non-treatment follow-up study if the follow-up study is conducted by a contractor who had not been directly involved in their initial treatment. This would result in decreasing the amount of data collected and compromise the statistical validity of the follow-up study. Based on these considerations, it is determined that a full and open competitive award is not deemed to be in the Government's best interest for this acquisition. See Number Note 22. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. No Contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to: Roshawn Simpson, Contract Specialist, via email: rsimpson@nida.nih.gov. TELEPHONE AND FACSIMILE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>D -- USAID Internet-Based Ocean Freight Payment System -- Request for Information
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)
OCEAN FREIGHT PAYMENT SYSTEM
1	Introduction

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking to obtain information regarding web-based electronic freight payment systems.  USAID is seeking the best value fully functioning web-based solution that meets the needs of the Agency.  The proposed solution may be either commercially off the shelf software (COTS) package(s), a custom built solution or a combination of both.    The required services under this RFI will be generally limited to use solely by USAID for payment of freight incurred as a result of ocean transportation contracts under the PL 480 Title II program.  The vast majority of these contracts are between commercial ocean carriers and non-government Cooperating Sponsors (CS), which includes Private Voluntary Organizations, Cooperatives, and International Organization Agencies, and are funded under USAID grants as described below.  In addition, some Title II impelled cargoes are transported under direct USAID contacts with ocean carriers.

In general the system must:  (1) Perform automated evaluation of freight payment documentation submitted to USAID by CS and ocean carriers; (2) Allow same-day payment of freight upon receipt of necessary documentation and concurrences; (3) Operate under multiple freight payment scenarios based upon varying shipment terms (including dry bulk charters, liner bookings, staggered payment terms, liquidated damages, port-to-port and combined ocean and inland through bills of lading); (4) Maintain searchable records of payment data and corresponding documentation, including invoices, bills of lading, and related communications; (5) Provide robust and dynamic reporting capabilities including spreadsheet and chart functions; (6) Allow for user-controlled evaluation audits and overrides; (7) Interface with USAID's current XML-based financial management system, Momentum (CGI Federal Inc.) and the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).

The Ocean Freight Payment System (OFPS) project is divided into two phases.  Phase I consists of: (1) Conducting a needs assessment; (2) Documenting the As-Is environment; (3) Documenting the desired capabilities for the To-Be OFPS, which includes a formal business process analysis with workflows enabling USAID to easily and economically explore more than one To-Be business process option and to cost different sets of requirements.  The second and final phase (Phase II) will involve: (1) Validation of the desired capabilities; (2) Design and development (custom); (3) Integration (COTS); (4) Testing; (5) Deployment of OFPS, including creating user and system documentation and conducting user training.


2	General Information

USAID, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has the responsibility of managing food aid programs that provide agricultural commodities to food deficit countries and populations.  Providing food aid is a collaborative effort requiring the participation of many stakeholders, both within and outside the U.S. Government.  USAID, through funding provided by Public Law 480, Title II, makes commodity donations to Cooperating Sponsors to address the needs of food security in both multi-year development projects and emergency food assistance programs. 
     
The transportation element of the PL 480, Title II  program is financed by the Commodity Credit Corporation/USDA and administered by USAID in accordance with USAID Regulation 11, 22 CFR Part 211.  This program provides emergency food shipments in the form of bulk grains and processed packaged commodities to various countries under both USAID and CS transportation contracts.  Over fiscal year 2006, a total of 2,698,504 metric tons of food aid was booked for both liner and charter shipments under the Title II program with a total freight cost of $ 179,236,991. Without guarantee, it is expected that the tonnage programmed for Fiscal Year 2008 for Title II volumes should approach the same as the FY 2006 levels.

Solicitations for transportation services for Title II impelled bulk commodities are advertised on the USAID website.  The resulting freight contracts are scribed on a charter party form.  Solicitations for the transportation of parcel (i.e. bagged, liner) commodities are advertised on USDA's Freight Bid Entry System (FBES), and the resulting contracts are typically in a booking note format.

Food aid commodities are transported under both USAID and CS transportation contracts with ocean carriers.  Under USAID transportation contracts, freight is remitted directly by USAID to the ocean carrier upon notice satisfactory to USAID of cargo's arrival at first or sole port of discharge.  Under CS transportation contracts, freight is remitted by USAID first to the CS under a previously awarded grant agreement, then from the CS to the ocean carrier, upon presentation of proper documentation to USAID.  In either case, before the payment described above will be effected, a fax notice or other appropriate electronic transmission of vessel's arrival at first or sole port of discharge must be received by the CS or USAID from the country / region where the port of discharge is located.  The carrier is to submit the following documentation to USAID as part of the invoice package requesting payment of freight (payment package): 


a)   	Voucher for payment of freight submitted on a 1034 Voucher Form;  

b)   	Signed, certified "clean - unclaused" Rated On-Board Bill of Lading 

c)   	Copy of fully signed Charter Party, and any Addenda thereto;

d)  	Certified copy of Tariff page with Tariff page certification (for liner carriers only);

e)   	Copy of Agent's / Broker's "paid" commission invoice;

f)   	Signed copies of the weight certificate (for bulk carriers only);

g)   	Signed copy of Vessel Hold Inspection Certificate or Container Inspection Certificate issued by Federal Grain Inspection Services (FGIS);

h)   	Signed copies of Vessel Inspection Certificate issued by National Cargo Bureau (NCB) (bulk or breakbulk carriers only).


USAID does not currently utilize an integrated IT system for the electronic processing of freight payment packages and the expedited remittance of funds.  Rather, freight documents are first reviewed manually for accuracy.  Subsequently, upon confirmation of available funds under the correct contract obligation, the associated payment vouchers are submitted for processing through USAID's Office of Financial Management (FM).  In turn, FM processes the payment vouchers via USAID?s financial management system, Momentum (CGI Federal Inc.).  

Due to the capital intensive nature of modern marine transportation, USAID would prefer to employ a web-based, electronic freight payment system which will both expedite payment of ocean freight to carriers while maintaining a robust level of control over said payments.  For example, often if the ocean carrier is delayed in delivering cargo to destination, USAID or the CS may assess liquidated damages at a predetermined rate ($1-$2 per metric ton for each day?s delay in delivery).  As such, the preferred ocean freight payment system should have the capability to both process payments faster than the conventional means discussed above, while allowing for a percentage of freight to be held in abeyance subject to the successful delivery of commodities.  Moreover, USAID is seeking a user-friendly system, which both allows for human-user interface while reducing the manpower necessary to manually process freight payment packages.

<DESC>**Solicitation subsections I (Security), J (GFE/GFI), K (Protected Critical Infrastructure Information), L (Non Disclosure Agreements) of section II above and sections III (Clauses), IV (Instructions), and V (Evaluation) are provided below as amendment 1 to this solicitation.** I. Security i. The contractor must possess a current Top Secret facility security clearance issued by the Defense Security Service (DSS) in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M, prior to contract performance. a. All contractor personnel assigned to this contract shall possess security clearances issued by the Defense Security (DSS) commensurate with their required level of access to classified information.  Interim Secret clearances are acceptable for Secret information with the exception of RD, CNWDI, SCI and NATO Information.  Final clearances are required for those categories.  Final Top Secret clearances are required for access to TS information (interim clearances are not acceptable.)  Specifically designated contractor employees must also be eligible for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), in accordance with DCID 6/4, at U.S. Government facilities.  DCID 6/4 waivers will not be considered unless an extreme emergency exists. b. The contractor shall also possess DSS-approved safeguarding capability for Secret classified information in performance of this contract.  All automated processing of classified information must be accomplished on DSS-approved information systems. c. DHS has determined that performance of this contract requires that the contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (collectively herein known as 'contractor'), requires access to classified National Security Information (herein known as classified information). Classified information is government information that requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, and supplementing directives. The contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for the protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the contractor has access to classified information at a DHS or other government facility, it shall abide by the requirements set by the agency. ii. Implementing Instructions for Compliance with HSAR clause 3052.204-71 'Contractor Employee Access' a. General Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) clause 3052.204-71 requires that contractor personnel requiring unescorted access to government facilities, access to sensitive information, or access to government information technology (IT) resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy requires a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract for all contractor personnel who require recurring access to government facilities or access to sensitive information, or access to government IT resources.
Contractor employees will be given a suitability determination unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures.  Requirements for suitability determination are defined in paragraph 3.0. b. Additional Information for Classified Contracts Performance of this contract requires the Contractor to gain access to classified National Security Information (includes documents and material).  Classified information is Government information which requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, National Security Information (NSI) as amended and supplemental directives. The Contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, an attachment to the contract, and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the Contractor is required to have access to classified information at a DHS or other Government Facility, it shall abide by the requirements set forth by the agency. c. General Requirement The Contractor shall ensure these instructions are expressly incorporated into any and all subcontracts or subordinate agreements issued in support of this contract. d. Contractor Personnel(1) Employment Eligibility To comply with the requirements HSAR Clause 3052.204-71, and Department policy, the contractor must complete the following forms for applicable personnel who will be performing work under this contract as indicated: *Standard Form (SF) 85P, 'Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions' *FD-258 fingerprint cards *DHS Form 11000-6, 'Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement'. Required of all applicable contractor personnel.  *DHS Form 11000-9, 'Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)'. (2) Continued Eligibility 
The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on contracts if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns.  (3) Termination The DHS Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five (5) days of occurrence.  The Contractor shall return to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) all DHS issued identification cards and building passes that have either expired or have been collected from terminated employees.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report shall be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to who it was issued and the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. e. Suitability Determination DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary suitability checks.  The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow.  A favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar DHS from withdrawing or terminating access government facilities or information, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Security Office. Contract employees waiting for an EOD decision may begin work on the contract provided they do not access sensitive Government information.  Limited access to Government buildings is allowable prior to the EOD decision if the Contractor is escorted by a Government employee.  This limited access is to allow Contractors to attend briefings, non-recurring meetings and begin transition work. f. Background Investigations Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, requiring access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date and time for the receipt of proposals and past performance questionnaires and to respond to questions submitted by potential offerors.  

1. The due date and time for the receipt of proposals and past performance questionnaires is extended to 8/6/07 at 10:00 a.m. EST.  

2. Responses to questions are provided below.

Question 1: Will a separate CLIN be established for Task D.1 (Project Management)?

Response:  No. Any anticipated costs associated with the Project Management task should be factored into the firm fixed price proposed for CLINs 0001 and 0101.

Question 2: According to the RFP, CLIN 0001 will be firm fixed price and CLIN 0002 will be labor hours.  Is the Government asking for an hourly rate to be quoted for both? Please clarify if possible.  

Response: The Government is not asking for an hourly rate for CLINs 0001 or 0101, which are firm fixed priced.  In proposing pricing for performance under these CLINs the offeror will identify a firm fixed unit price per month and multiply the unit price by 12.  The Government IS asking for an hourly rate for CLINs 0002 and 0102, which are labor hour CLINs.  In proposing pricing for performance under these CLINs the offeror will identify an hourly rate and multiply it by 960 hours.

Question 3: Is [this] solicitation a new requirement or is there an incumbent?  Also, is there a contractor currently performing similar work?

Response: There is an incumbent currently performing this work.

All other terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged.

V.  Evaluation A. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary. B. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following technical factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Personnel Qualifications:  Key person(s) possesses training in both accounting, finance, business, and the physical sciences and has relevant experience providing acquisition and finance support for a science based federal government program. 2. Technical Capability and Approach:  Demonstrated ability to fulfill the Statement of Work requirements, an understanding of the required tasks, and an approach to successfully fulfilling them. 3. Past Performance: Demonstrated ability to provide the same or similar services. C. Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b), Price Analysis.  Funding in the amount of $5,000 annually has been budgeted for travel under this requirement.  Accordingly, $5,000 will be added to the total evaluated price for the Base Year and $5,000 will be added to the total evaluated price for the Option Year. D. Personnel Qualifications is the most important factor. E. Technical Capability and Approach and Past Performance are approximately equal in importance. F. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Price will become a more significant factor in determining best value as offers become more equivalent in terms of technical merit. G. Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). H. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. I.  Questions about the solicitation shall be submitted via email by 7/31/07 at 10:00 a.m. EST to John Nash at john.nash@dhs.gov. J. Proposals shall be submitted via email by 8/3/07 at 10:00 a.m. EST to John Nash at john.nash@dhs.gov.  Late submissions will not be considered.

4. Primary POCs: Maj Jonathan Bishop, Technical Advisor, (310) 416-1770; Kristy Kuhlman, Contracts Manager, (310) 416-1728.  
5. Reference number: 07-54	
6. Clarification:  White Papers may be submitted through 14 March 2008.  This announcement is open to all offerors (not restricted to small businesses).  The POC for contractual issues is Kristy Kuhlman and can be reached at kristy.kuhlman.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and 310-416-1728.
7. Description:

The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SMC SYSW), Space Control Technologies Division (SYSW/ENT) Los Angeles AFB, is soliciting white papers to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in Space Situation Awareness in Satellite Attitude Estimation from Optical Imagery.

The purpose of this BAA is the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  This BAA will be used by SYSW to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  Submittals that focus on a specific system such as RAIDRS or SBSS will not be considered eligible for award.  For more information regarding BAAs see FAR Part 35.016.

The objective of this research is to demonstrate technologies enabling automatic attitude determination of satellites from imagery using limited data, such as telescope location and look angle and target satellite ephemeris, to determine where a principal axis such as the satellite line of sight intersects the earth. The algorithm or technique should be capable of operating on imagery obtained in daylight from ground-based telescopes, possibly with some degree of post-processing. Near-real-time techniques are desirable, but non-real-time techniques are also of interest, particularly if they offer additional capability (such as determination of antenna or solar array orientation). Strong preference will be given to concepts that modify existing algorithms or techniques over those offering to develop new algorithms or techniques.

Papers should address three key areas: 1) Adaptation of algorithms to the task of estimating satellite attitude; 2) Development of a toolset allowing the demonstration of the algorithms on available imagery; 3) Laboratory demonstration/validation of algorithm and toolset performance.

The white papers will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  (1) Suitability of the basic estimation approach to satellite attitude estimation; (2) Demonstrated maturity of the basic estimation approach (may be demonstrated for problems unrelated to satellite attitude estimation) (3) Affordability (price, in the context of affordability of white papers versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting white papers for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations); (4) Additional capabilities and computational requirements. Basic suitability is the most important factor. Demonstrated maturity and affordability are of equal importance. Factor 4 will be a substantial consideration but is the least important factor. Price will be evaluated and white papers may be negotiated or selected for award.  No further evaluation criteria will be used. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA.  

The white paper shall include the following items.  (a) Executive Summary:  Describe the proposed program, objectives, and approach.  A description of the innovation and benefits of the proposed approach and relationship to previous efforts should be discussed.  b) Description:  Describe the techniques, methods, materials, or ideas that will be addressed in this white paper, their innovation, and to what degree they advance the state-of-the-art.  (c) Program Plan:  Describe in detail the planned technical approach, how the approach will be executed, and anticipated period of performance in months. (d) Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate (ROM).  

Please be advised that The Aerospace Corporation, MITRE, SAIC, and Scitor will be assisting the Government in the evaluation of white papers.  If you believe that a potential conflict of interest exists, or you have other concerns, contract the Contracting Officer, Ann Birbeck at (310) 535-2634, as soon as possible, but no later than the time of your white paper submission.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES A SOLICITATION FOR A WHITE PAPER.  DO NOT SEND A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. The government may award classified or unclassified contracts as a result of this BAA.   Offerors responding to this announcement are required to submit with a cover letter, an original and three copies of the white paper.

The cover letter must be signed and dated by an authorized official of the organization

Page Limitations:  The white papers shall be limited to 10 pages, single spaced, double-sided, 8.5 by 11-inch pages.  When both sides of a sheet display printed material, it shall be counted as two pages. Each page of the white paper will be counted except for cover pages, table of contents, tabs, glossaries, and acronym lists. Margins shall be one-inch on all sides.  Select an easy to read font no smaller than 12 point.  Smaller type may be used in figures and tables as long as it is clearly legible.  The Government will not consider white papers in excess of this page limitation.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  THOSE WHITE PAPERS FOUND TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BAA MAY BE INVITED TO SUBMIT A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL AND A COST PROPOSAL.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  The Government reserves the right to enter negotiations on any, all, part, or none of the papers received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors white paper to determine the overall merit of the white paper in response to this announcement.    Principle funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY08.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, SMC/SYSW, Los Angeles AFB, CA:  Ms. Kristy Kuhlman, phone (310) 416-1728, email kristy.kuhlman.ctr@losangeles.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The cost of preparing white papers in response to this announcement is NOT considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SCI information at time of award. 

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Ms Ann Birbeck (310) 535-2634.  This BAA will remain open for 6 months from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, whichever is first.  While white papers will be accepted at any time, white papers received later in the fiscal year have a greater risk of not being funded due to unavailability of funds.  Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the government.

7. Description:

The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), Space Control Technologies Division (SYSW/ENT) Los Angeles AFB, is soliciting white papers to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in Intelligence Data Fusion and Decision Support Tools to support the Defensive Counterspace (DCS) Mission area.  

The purpose of this BAA is the acquisition of basic and applied research consistent with advancing the knowledge of data fusion and decision support tools.  This BAA will be used by SYSW to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art and increasing knowledge in the areas of data fusion and decision support analysis.  Submittals that focus on a specific existing system or program, such as SBSS or RAIDRS, or planned system will not be considered eligible for award.  For more information regarding BAAs see FAR Part 35.016.

This BAA seeks a white paper on offerors? concepts for Intelligence Data Fusion and Decision Support Capabilities focused on space control applications including Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and DCS.  It is desired that, at a minimum, Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) Fusion Levels 1-3 and potentially 0, 4 and 5 shall be addressed in the BAA concepts.  

The goal of this basic and applied research is to develop and demonstrate the capability to bring together a large number of data sources with differing formats and data types to enable predictive battlespace awareness and characterization to support a quick decision process.  Several obstacles to obtaining access to the data sources are security classification, restricted data access, or lack of a network interface.  SYSW/ENT desires to have predictive capability to identify a threatening situation which may be developing.  The goal of studying the fusing of various data sources and decision support analysis is to enable an operator to easily identify what is occurring and what the required defensive action might be.  

Offerer's white paper should recommend data fusion and/or decision support approaches for the space control mission area that provide the best method to make quick decisions and address how they will mitigate any problems to accessing the various data sources.   Offerors shall additionally demonstrate their concept to the Government by modeling and simulation demonstrations.

Below are specific areas to consider:

A. Data Fusion
1. Intelligence Data Fusion (primary focus)
	a. Multiple intelligence sources integration
b. Key entity extraction from unstructured text 
2. Sensor Fusion (secondary focus)
a. Multiple hypothesis tracking ? both quantitative (e.g. position) & qualitative (e.g. electronic identification)
b. Tools to fuse different types of sensor data
B. Decision Support 
1. Threat Level Indication
a. Ability to adapt to new threats scenarios
b. Quickly identify new trends without long training sequences
2. Data Visualization ? clearly and concisely present event data to operator
3. Data Correlation ? correlate events (objects with attributes)
C. Data Mining
1. Unsupervised ? multivariate statistics methods & clustering
2. Supervised ? classification engines including decision trees, neural networks, and Bayesian networks
D. Data Handling
1. Handle different data source formats
2. Database schema translation
3. Generate/update/manage data schema, meta data content & data dictionaries
4. Data validation methods (e.g. watermarking)
E. Information Management and Exploitation
1. Database and management functions - support agile exchange between producers and consumers in dynamic environments
2. Collaborative tools and processes - ensure rapid, effective decision-making in dynamic environments
F. Automated Capabilities
1. Immediate threat action required warnings
2. Conjunction predictions
3. Proximity awareness
4. Maneuver detection

The white papers will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the white paper, (2) Importance to advancing knowledge of data fusion technology and decision support analysis, and (3) Affordability.  Price, in the context of affordability of white papers versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting white papers for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Price will be evaluated and white papers may be negotiated or selected for award.  No further evaluation criteria will be used. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA.  The government estimates awarding multiple contracts for a combined total of $2M.   The period of performance for any proposed effort should be no longer than nine months.

The white paper shall include the following items.  (a) Executive Summary:  Describe the proposed study, objectives, and approach.  A description of the innovation and benefits of the proposed approach and relationship to similar efforts should be discussed.  b) Description:  Describe the techniques, methods, materials, or ideas that will be addressed in this white paper, their innovation, and to what degree they advance the state-of-the-art.  (c) Program Plan:  Describe in detail the planned technical approach, how the approach will be executed, and anticipated period of performance in months. (d) Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate (ROM).
