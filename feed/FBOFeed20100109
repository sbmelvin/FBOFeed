2.  Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be machine planted on a 10’ X 10’ spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 276 acres.  The planting for the area, except for strips around water impoundments, will consist of one mix described in the Tree Planting Plan attachment to this solicitation. 

3.  Species:  Refer to the attached Tree Planting Specifications.

Each referred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and secondary species will make up no more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around impoundments.  In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be used. 
	
4.  Species Substitution:  If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one. Contractor must acquire approval from the NRCS for any species substitution.  	

5.  Spacing and Planting Rate:  Hardwood will be planted on a 10’ X 10’ spacing (436 seedlings per acre).  The number of satisfactory planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 370 seedlings per acre.   Areas along the shores of impoundments and natural slough and wet depressions will be planted with the proper species and to the extend that the water depth will allow.  In these areas, spacing will be increase to 15’ X 15’.

All care must be taken to prevent tearing of roots. 

b.  Tops: Tops may be pruned to a minimum height of 16”.

Steps needed to ensure the compacting of the soil around the seedling, leaving no air pockets in the planting slit, will be taken.  When optimum site and soil moisture and/or temperature conditions are not available, consult with the NRCS before planting. 

11.  Quality Control:  The Control will be ultimately responsible for quality assurance.  Quality control will be explained during the Pre-Planting Conference.  In addition, NRCS representatives will be available during the first day of planting and will occasionally visit the site during planting.  They will also be available for consultation, but they will not serve as daily inspectors.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide daty-to-day oversight of the planting crews.  NRCS will conduct an inspection at the completion of the planting to determine the acceptability of the planting.

<DESC>1.  The following topic is hereby added to the announcement:
Topic (p): Management and utilization of terabytes of Test and Comms data
Data and information continue to grow in size and complexity as weapon systems have become increasingly more automated and controlled by ever complicated and growing software modules.  With higher complexity of the systems as well as attempts to integrate stand-alone systems into a system of systems, the size of weapon system test data and communication information have grown from megabytes to terabytes and the trend continues to be upward.  As data collection continues to grow by orders of magnitude it has become extremely challenging to know what data and information is important, how much of it should be collected and what level of prioritization should be applied to analysis and reporting.  The DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) at the Army Research Lab in Aberdeen has made significant progress in scientific visualization, application of High-Power Computing (HPC) to data reduction, and research in parallel processing techniques.  The expertise of weapon systems analysts and engineers needs to be merged with these resources to generate solutions that allow analysis of the most critical data items and information in order to give the war fighter and decision makers the most comprehensive visual situational awareness of the battle space.    
2.  This announcement will remain open and white papers will be accepted through 30 September 2010."
