The required systems combine performance specifications, software-programmability, open architecture, environmental ruggedness with the software-defined networking and multi-core DSP necessary to support D/OT&amp;E activities from mobile ground and small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS), Airborne Manned Surveillance Aircraft and Manned Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR).<br /><br />This equipment will be paired with equipment already owned by the Agency. <br /><br />The specifications of the required items are as follows: <br /><br />Item 0001<br /><br />&bull; Four (4) SYMPHONY HTLx+-TP, Miniature Quad Transceiver Core Systems packaged in Rugged, Conduction-Cooled Mobile/Tactical Enclosure<br />&bull; 4 Independent or Phase-Coherent Receive/Transmit (Rx/Tx) Channels<br />&bull; 2 MHz - 18,000 MHz Rx/Tx Tuner/Exciter Range, each Channel<br />&bull; 100 MHz Instantaneous Bandwidth Rx/Tx, each Channel<br />&bull; 1x Gigabit Ethernet Control/Data Input/Output (I/O)<br />&bull; 2x SFP+ 10 Gigabit Ethernet Data I/O<br />&bull; Serial &amp; General-Purpose I/O<br />&bull; Altera Stratix 10 SG280 SoC (GX2800 FPGA) for 100 MHz DSP<br />&bull; PolyPNTR-based SAASM GPS, INS, LN-CSAC<br />&bull; MIL-STD-810G Tested for High/Low Temperature, Shock, Vibration, Humidity, Drop, Dust/Sand and Rain<br /><br />Item 0002<br /><br />Two (2) SYMPHONY DualPack Plus, Rugged, Conduction-Cooled Rackmount Enclosure Systems, each supporting up to two SYMPHONY HTLx+ (S10 based) Radio Frequency (RF) Cores and one SYMPHONY Dual Signal Processing Core System <br />&bull; Supports 8 Rx/Tx Channels, 2-18000 MHz Frequency Range<br />&bull; Supports 100 MHz/Channel Instantaneous Bandwidth<br />&bull; PolyPNTR-based SAASM GPS, INS, LN-CSAC with common Position, Navigation, Timing (PNT) References and N-Channel Coherence across RF Cores 1 &amp; 2 as well as additional DualPack Plus<br />&bull; Single Board Computer (SBC) for Transceiver, Antenna, Amplifier and Rackmount Command, Control (C2) &amp; Cybersecurity with Secure Boot, Removable SSD, HW Encryption, ATA Security Erase and HW Zeroization Features (Panic Support/Secure Erase)<br />&bull; Bulk Encryption Device<br />&bull; Cross-Domain Guard Solution (CDS)<br />&bull; Wideband Recorder<br />&bull; PCIe &amp; Thunderbolt 3 Support<br />&bull; MIL-STD-810G Tested for High/Low Temperature, Shock and Vibration with Performance for Medium-Altitude Flight in Tactical Aircraft<br />Item 0003<br />Two (2) SYMPHONY HTLp-TP Dual Signal Processing Core Systems <br />&bull; Supports 8 Rx/Tx Channels, 2-18000 MHz Frequency Range<br />&bull; Supports 100 MHz/Channel Instantaneous Bandwidth<br />&bull; Quad Computer for Processing, Antenna, Amplifier and Command, Control (C2) &amp; Cybersecurity with Secure Boot, Removable SSD, HW Encryption, ATA Security Erase and HW Zeroization Features (Panic Support/Secure Erase)<br />&bull; 1/10 Gigabit Ethernet (1/10 GigE) Switch for 1 GigE C2 and 10 GigE Data Coherence and Distribution<br />&bull; Cables and connectors <br />&bull; MIL-STD-810G and MIL-STD-461G Tested<br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for the purchase of the items described above with: Herrick Technology Laboratories, Inc. (HTL), 20201 Century Boulevard Suite 200, Germantown, MD 20874.<br /><br />The Government has made a determination that no other source can meet this requirement. HTL is the only known manufacturer of the required items which are compatible and interoperable with AFRL's previously purchased systems. Alternatives offered by other sources would require modifications and extensive additional integration with existing antenna arrays and rugged mission computers, whereas acquisition of the above items will ensure immediate interoperability with an existing investment. Use of alternatives offered by other sources would result in the Government experiencing a duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br /><br />Responses received will be evaluated however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 September 2018.
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.<br /><br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate<br /><br />26 Electronic Parkway<br />Rome, New York 13441 <br />United States</p>

<CONTACT>Cheryl Vendemia, Phone 3016196004, Email cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (One source) to Thermo Fisher Scientific for laboratory reagents and consumables. <br />Utilizing the Applied Biosystems* 7500 Fast Real-time PCR, MiSeq and MiniSeq platforms, reagents and compatible consumables are required to perform molecular diagnosis of Influenza virus, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Mayaro, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika virus. Specifically, this requirement involves using PCR enzymes for reverse transcription, Real-Time and Illumina platforms fused for the following:
<p>&bull; Detecting human influenza viruses (Influenza A-matrix gene and B) and its subtypes (H3, Hlpdrn/SwHlNl, Hl seasonal and H5) (Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) N6-VIR-MB RV 014).<br />&bull; Sequencing full genome of Influenza A using random amplification and pathogen discovery protocols in Illumina platform.<br />&bull; Detecting genetic material of Adenovirus in nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 007).<br />&bull; Detecting the genetic material of Metapneumovirus (MPV), Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in nasal and pharyngeal swabs specimens using a reverse transcription (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 006). <br />&bull; Amplification of the whole genome of the Influenza A virus based on the amplification of full-length gene segments for SNP genotyping, gene expression analysis, and genotype (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 001).<br />&bull; Pathogen discovery in respiratory and serum samples collected in our surveillance protocols.</p>
<p>NAMRU-6 owns and uses the Applied Biosystems* 7500 Fast Real-time PCR, MiSeq and MiniSeq platforms, where the supplies have been validated, and therefore, compatibility of the consumables is a requirement. Design and validation of NAMRU-6 laboratory procedures have been standardized with these items, since they have shown to perform up to NAMRU-6's research standards. Assays have been developed independently for each SOP followed in the laboratories; therefore, the reagents must remain the same as the ones specified in the SOPs, otherwise, the design and validation of these processes would have to be reinitiated from zero, which would delay all processing and the timely diagnosis of public health relevant pathogens. Changing the source of reagents would mean altering the validity of the results for the surveillance studies that measure rates of disease across years.</p>
<p>While the majority of the items are available through Thermo Fisher Scientific only; some items are available from other sources; however, the only vendor that can provide all items together is the proposed source. Items must arrive at NAMRU-6 in Lima, Peru in accordance with a defined schedule in order to sustain the laboratory activities to meet the mission of NAMRU-6. The only way to assure that the items will arrive as required is by purchasing from one vendor. Peruvian customs clearance usually takes between 3-4 weeks, and having multiple shipments from multiple orders pending in customs could lead to some reagents being unavailable when needed for conducting for testing, this would be detrimental to mission-critical processes and ultimately lead to a delay in reporting research results and findings to our funders.</p>
<p>*Applied Biosystems merged with Life Technologies that was later acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2014.<br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28 Schenck Pkwy, Suite 400, Asheville, NC, 28805-5053.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 4:00PM Eastern Time, 5 June 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil AND roger.k.batchelor2.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to e-Control Systems, Inc. for the purchase of an integrated hardware and software system for temperature monitoring compliant with CDC's Quality Management System (QMS). The package that e-Controls provides is the only option that provides an integrated system of temperature monitoring hardware and software to store temperature readings, provide automated alerts based on those readings, and a user-interface for viewing and maintaining the information with fine-grained control on user access while meeting OCSIO requirements for network and data security. The system also meets the requirements of being a single system for monitoring hundreds of pieces of equipment distributed across multiple rooms and buildings, and being scalable for additional equipment and locations within DVBD. Additionally, e-Controls meets OCISO's requirements for network and data security, including: 1) wireless data transmission with an encryption algorithm, 2) data storage in an approved and regularly backed-up and scanned relational database management system, and 3) a user-interface which passes OCISO's regular security scans. This system is linked to and compatible with the Laboratory's existing network and does not require additional software; compatibility with the Laboratory's system is critical for successful operation. Finally, this system has been vetted and is compliant with CDC security, which is required before implementation in the Laboratory. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong><br />PURSUANT TO FAR Subpart 5.2-Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO ACTION.
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), on behalf of the National Institutes of Mental Health intends to negotiate and award a contract with the North Western University to obtain "NIH Toolbox" Design Consulting for Research Domain Criteria Field Test Battery. North Western is the only source can furnish the requirements, to the exclusion of other sources, because they have worked on apps that employ IRT and CAT approaches to achieve brief presentation while maintaining optimal reliability and validity, and that inlclude both behavioral tasks and also self-report measures (for traits that cannot feasibly be assessed by behavioral tasks). They have prior experience in developing tasks that can be adapted as necessary for a wide range of ages, from middle childhood (where feasible and appropriate) throughout the entire adult life span.</p>
<p>Specifically, NIMH seeks to gather further information regarding the technical approaches of the "NIH Toolbox" project, in which applications were developed to measure a wide range of applications for measuring traits and behaviors in large studies, including major studies supported by NIMH such as the Human Connectome Project. It is critical to attain consulation regarding the Toolbox instruments for two reasons: first, the Toolbox platform is used across many NIH projects, and so can provide common testing environments and integration across studies from multiple NIH Institutes; and second, these tasks represent leading candidates for common data elements in the future, that will be required across many studies so as to facilitate large-scale analyses. NIMH requires a contractor that has experience with tasks presented to large numbers of subjects across multiple NIH-supported projects, in order to plan for the use of common data elements across studies that allow data mining in very large samples.  NIMH requires a contractor that is working on apps that employ IRT and CAT approaches to achieve brief presentation time while maintaining optimal reliability and validity, and that include both behavioral tasks and also self-report measures (for traits that cannot feasibly be assessed by behavioral tasks). NIMH requires a contractor with experience in developing tasks that can be adapted as necessary for a wide range of ages, from middle childhood (where feasible and appropriate) throughout the entire adult life span. Finally, NIMH requires a contractor whose research includes tasks and measures that assess various RDoC constructs. Accordingly, North Western University is uniquely qualified to provide the services required for this contract.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is developing a field test battery for its Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. RDoC is a research framework for studying mental disorders that is organized around particular domains of cognition or functioning, such as fear, memory, and social cognition, rather than traditional diagnostic categories such as schizophrenia or depression. In diagnosing patients and devising outcomes of clinical trials, the emphasis is upon quantitative measurement of such functions rather than reports of symptoms as in traditional studies. There is accordingly a need to develop tests and measures of these functions that are reliable and valid in multiple settings. The RDoC framework specifies dimensions of behavior or cognition that are based upon both a validated function (such as fear or working memory) and a neural circuit or system that has been shown to play a primary role in implementing each function. This approach was taken deliberately to increase the scientific rigor for each dimension, but most tests designed over the past decades have not used this circuit-based approach. For this reason, there are relatively few tests available to date for RDoC dimensions, and extant tests must be chosen carefully to ensure that they meet the standards.</p>
<p>NIMH has been actively evaluating and supporting the development of such tests and measures over the past several years, but these have focused on studies conducted in laboratories and clinics where tests are implemented by dedicated laboratory equipment with sophisticated stimulus presentation and data recording capabilities. Further, for some tasks the primary measurement involves a physiological reaction rather than behavioral responses. Currently, NIMH has initiated the development of a field test battery to be deployed in very large, population-based samples (such as the "All of Us" sample of the Precision Medicine Initiative) in order to provide normative data and study the relationship of various RDoC domains to other measures of mental illness and related health outcomes as gauged by electronic health records. In this case the tests must be administered via internet-based tasks in a subject's home, with the result that some extant tasks cannot be used at all and others must be modified extensively for use with a small device in a home setting.</p>
<p>In 2016 a workgroup of the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) completed a report about Tasks and Measures for RDoC constructs. This report provides a starting point for the proposed work. However, the report emphasized paradigms that can be used in laboratory settings, that sometimes depend on physiological recordings as the primary measure or have other features that make field testing impossible (for instance, the use of a group of laboratory confederates to study social stress). In addition, the field is developing rapidly, and in the year since this report was compiled, more tests have appeared for development by various groups. Therefore, considerable additional work is needed to build upon the foundation of the NAMHC workgroup's report.</p>
<p>As mentioned, there are relatively few appropriate tests available for RDoC dimensions to date, and for a number of the 39 current constructs there are no tests at all. Therefore, expert opinion regarding the priority for commissioning development of tests to measure particular dimensions constitutes a final important element of the work to be performed under this contract.</p>
<p>This contract aligns closely with the RDoC goals in the NIMH Strategic Plan, which call for enhancing the ability of the RDoC framework to support research that explores domains of functioning that cut across traditional mental disorder categories.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong></span><br />The purpose of this contract is to obtain expert consultation regarding: 1) the overall concept and development of a comprehensive web-based test battery that emphasizes tasks that engage subjects' interest; 2) expertise in tasks that utilize item-response theory (IRT) and computer-adaptive testing (CAT) approaches to derive valid data in a short time period; 3) expertise and experience with the tasks used in the NIH Toolbox and other tasks being developed for NIH-directed research, in order to achieve compatibility and common data elements where possible among various NIH projects; 4) expertise in self-report measures that may need to be used where behavioral tasks are not feasible; 5) expertise in developing tasks and measures that are scalable across as broad an age range as possible.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1
For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($250K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C244-18-AP-0150

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 04, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), supported by NCO4 Pittsburgh.  Purchase request 646-18-4-080-0616 applies.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  This acquisition includes supplies and services.  Supplies include system specific reagents fitted in cartridges, and chips necessary to conduct DNA gene sequencing of tumor tissue samples.  System validation services are also included to ensure the system and operators are using the system as designed and achieving the correct results.  Access to outside databases and the VA network are not required for this procurement.  The period of performance for this contract is six (6) months with the objective being a validated system which will then be employed to read tumor samples for VAPHS patients and direct a knowledge based care protocol.  Contract award needs to be made in FY18 to utilize budgeted funding.  

The estimated amount for this procurement is $160,410.

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  The supplies and software utilized by ThermoFisher Scientific s Ion Torrent S5 DNA sequencing system were designed for use in that system alone.  The supplies and software are proprietary to ThermoFisher and there are no authorized licensees or distributors.  There are no other known compatible suppliers. Per a ThermoFisher informational brochure on the S5 DNA sequencing system,  All trademarks are the property of ThermoFisher Scientific and its subsidiaries unless otherwise specified. 

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  An affirmative statement was provided by ThermoFisher Scientific that the system, supplies, and software are proprietary and there are currently no authorized licensees or distributors.  There is one (1) other known vendor who provides a system similar to ThermoFisher Scientific however the system does not have the gene sequencing sensitivity required by VAPHS.  It should also be noted the ThermoFisher Scientific solution was approved for use by the VAPHS Equipment Committee as the hospital s solution to meet the requirement and as such the equipment was procured in 2016 in furtherance of that purpose.  A Sources Sought announcement for this procurement was published on GSA e-Buy on 7/27/2018.  The Sources Sought was published on e-Buy under SIN 66 107 because the system itself was procured as a GSA Schedule buy under this SIN from a VOSB, Government Scientific Source which lists ThermoFisher as a  Point of Production  for this equipment and also carries a limited selection of related consumables.   No inquiries were received in response to the Sources Sought.  In addition, the Contracting Officer conducted searches of FBO, the VA s Electronic Contract Management System, and VetBiz database with negative results.  See completed Market Research report in the contract file for detailed information.

Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>The government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification to deliver the ACEII Ejection Seat (front and rear cockpit), National Stock Number (NSN): 1680-01-645-8077, PN 119050-573 and NSN: 1680-01-645-8078, PN 119050-575.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government does not own or have access to the engineering data for these items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN: 9.6pt 0in; mso-outline-level: 4"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FUNCTION:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></em></strong>The Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) was designed to be rugged and lightweight compared to earlier systems. It also was designed to be easy to maintain and updatable. It includes the following features: Electronic Sequencing and timing, Mortar-deployed main chute, Auto sensing of egress conditions, Parachute reefing to control opening at all speed ranges, and Multi-Mode operation for optimum recovery of the crewman.</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; text-underline: none">The ACES II is a third-generation seat, capable of ejecting a pilot from zero-zero conditions up to maximum altitude and airspeeds in the 600 KEAS range. The peak catapult acceleration is about 12gz. The ACES II has three main operating modes, one each for the low speed/low altitude, medium speed, and high speed/high altitude. In Mode 1, which includes 0-0 up to 250kts, the parachute is inflating in less than two seconds. In Mode 2 the chute is inflating in less than 6 seconds. Mode 2 is effective up to the maximum rated speed of the seat. Mode 3 deployment is delayed by the sequencer until the seat-man package reaches either Mode 2, or Mode 1 conditions, whichever comes first. Primarily, Mode 3 refers to operation above 15000 feet where separation from the seat would result in disconnection from the emergency oxygen, and also possible lead to more severe opening shock of the parachute due to differing atmospheric conditions. Seat modes are selected by the sequencer based on atmospheric conditions, and the modes vary depending on differences in the conditions such as apparent airspeed and apparent altitude. A light-weight crewman would reach an apogee of close to 200 feet if they ejected at ground level with zero airspeed. Typical performance is as follows: </span></h3>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; text-underline: none">The seat structure is primarily aluminum alloy stamp formed with ridges for structural strength. The box-like structure is referred to as a monologue construction. The back section which is nominally 16 inches wide has a set of three rollers on each side which interface with the extruded aluminum rails in the cockpit. The seat itself weighs approximately 127 pounds, with the rocket-catapult weighing 21LBs. The propulsion is a CKU-5/A/A rocket-catapult which uses a conventional solid propellant catapult charge to start seat movement, and a solid-propellant rocket motor to sustain the movement. The rocket motor is ignited at the end of the catapult stroke as the seat leaves the aircraft. The rocket-catapult is attached to the seat at the headrest end and to the cockpit at the base via a twin-barrel linear actuator which provides for seat height adjustment. The nominal adjustment range is +2.5-inch vertical adjustment. The actuator is attached at the fixed base to the cockpit structure and at the upper end via twin screw barrels to the base of the rocket-catapult. </span></h3>
<p>Seat functions are normally activated by the Recovery Sequencing Subsystem which consists of the environmental sensing unit, and the recovery sequencing unit, an electronic box located inside the seat rear on the right hand side. The environmental sensing unit consists of two altitude compensated dynamic pressure transducers, and two static pressure transducers. The dynamic pressure sensors (pitot tubes) are located on or near the headrest and read the air pressure as the seat exits the aircraft. The pressure differential between them and the ambient (static) sensors behind the seat is compared by the recovery sequencing unit to determine what operating mode the sequencer should select. The sequencer is fully redundant with two thermal batteries, two electrical systems, and an individual bridge wire from each in each of the electro-explosive squibs. The thermal batteries are activated by hot gas bled off from the catapult firing. There is a small window on the right side of the seat back to check the batteries for signs that they have been fired. Firing of the seat is normally by pulling one of the ejection control handles mounted on the seat bucket sides.<br /><br />See attached RFI with Contractor Capability Survey for additional details.</p>

<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW:<br />DLA-Aviation, Richmond is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to provide a strategic support solution that will provide supply inventory and distribution capabilities for all NSNs under Federal Supply Class (FSC) 53, Hardware and Abrasives. In addition, DLA-Aviation is attempting to learn about the commercial industry's best practices and implement a solution that leverages commercial supply chains. <br />This agency anticipates a single award, ten-year term for this proposed contract. Under the single award, there is the potential for Contractor Teaming Arrangements (CTA) for this proposed contract. Under a CTA, two or more contractors work together to meet ordering activity needs. Under such an arrangement, one supplier functions as the Team Lead and leads the team for performance and in communications with the Government. By complementing each other's capabilities, the Team offers a total solution to the ordering activity's requirement, providing a win-win situation for all parties. A possible end-result may be a ten-year contract to each Team Member. <br />Scope of Project:</p>
<p>This initiative contains 14,584 DLA managed National Stock Numbers (NSNs). The list is attached to this RFI. The NSNs are from the following Federal Supply Classes (FSCs):<br />Federal Supply Class 53 - Hardware and Abrasives:<br />FSC 5301 | Historical FSC<br />FSC 5305 | Screws<br />FSC 5306 | Bolts<br />FSC 5307 | Studs<br />FSC 5310 | Nuts and Washers<br />FSC 5315 | Nails, Machine Keys, and Pins<br />FSC 5320 | Rivets<br />FSC 5325 | Fastening Devices<br />FSC 5330 | Packing and Gasket Materials<br />FSC 5331 | O-Ring<br />FSC 5335 | Metal Screening<br />FSC 5340 | Hardware, Commercial<br />FSC 5341 | Brackets<br />FSC 5342 | Hardware, Weapon System<br />FSC 5345 | Disks and Stones, Abrasive<br />FSC 5346 | Historical FSC<br />FSC 5350 | Abrasive Materials<br />FSC 5355 | Knobs and Pointers<br />FSC 5360 | Coil, Flat, Leaf, and Wire Springs<br />FSC 5361 | Historical FSC<br />FSC 5365 | Bushings, Rings, Shims, and Spacers<br />FSC 5390 | Historical FSC<br />FSC 5395 | Historical FSC<br />Anticipated Scope:<br />The wholesale supply, storage and distribution for hardware and abrasives.

<SOLNBR>RFI_1205558
<RESPDATE>092718
<ARCHDATE>11012018
<CONTACT>Piya Sawhney, Contract Specialist, Phone 2404028709, Email piya.sawhney@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>Access to Outpatient Prescription and Patient Level Drug Utilization Data</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The FDA has access to multiple drug utilization databases, some of which contain data characterizing outpatient drug use patterns. Identifying data sources to support an improved view of the number of patients exposed to drugs and the number of prescriptions dispensed nationwide in the outpatient setting could greatly improve our understanding of how drugs are being prescribed under real-world conditions.</p>
<p>The Agency would like to determine sources available to provide direct, continuous, internet or network-based access to current and historical longitudinal data containing outpatient prescription and patient level drug utilization.  Outpatient settings of interest include retail and mail-order pharmacies, and if available, outpatient clinics or long-term care pharmacies.  The data will be used to describe national patterns of outpatient prescribing and patient-level drug utilization in the U.S.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10, Market Research. It is for information, planning and market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.</p>
<p>Background<br />A vital part of FDA and CDER's mission is to protect the public health.  The mission of the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) is to evaluate drug risks and promote the safe use of drugs by the American people.  The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products.  <br />In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the FDA is authorized by the FDA Amendments (2007) Act to expand database resources for providing advanced analyses of drug safety data to improve the quality of post-market risk/benefit analyses, and enhance the ability of FDA to make timely assessments of drug safety data.  In addition, the Act calls for enhanced authorities for accessing disparate data sources, and to establish and improve procedures to identify data trends and prescribing patterns for health care practitioners on a national level in the outpatient setting.<br />The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, also contains provisions for the FDA to increase surveillance and monitoring of certain medications such as opioids, which aligns with CDER's mission. This section of the Act encourages the use of real world evidence in the analysis of post market surveillance data to enable the Agency to respond promptly to serious public health issues.<br />The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of drug safety issues is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  Continued access to outpatient prescription and patient level data will complement and strengthen the utility of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) currently in place by providing estimates of the numbers of patients exposed to drugs and the numbers of prescriptions dispensed nationwide in the outpatient setting.  This data provides a denominator, or context, for understanding adverse event reports; for modeling drug risk based on usage patterns; and for calculating patient-based reporting rates for drugs used in the outpatient setting.  <br />Access to this data also increases the FDA's ability to perform regulatory impact studies; in particular, those studies that assess the impact of risk management plans and labeling changes on prescribing habits and usage patterns for prescription drugs. Finally, direct access to this data in real time enhances and accelerates the pace of FDA's regulatory decision-making process.  <br />The purpose of this RFI is to help the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) understand the diverse industry best practices, technical solutions, and sources capable of meeting the FDA's requirements. Specifically, the Government is seeking verification that its data requirement is commercially available, determine if there are any questions about the FDA's requirements, determine if industry notes any omissions in the requirements, and information about sources available to meet the FDA's requirements. FDA understands that teaming arrangements/partnerships may be required to address the governments requirements and are encouraged.</p>
<p>Requested Information</p>
<p>Interested parties should provide responses to the following questions (where available) regarding their data sources.</p>
<p>1)	Timeframe - How many calendar years of data are available on-line and how many are available offline?  Are there differences in the number of patients/prescriptions captured each year?

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background</strong>: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>As a part of HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative launched by NIH this year, NCATS is currently pursuing screening of several opioid-related targets for primary and follow-up approaches. As the important secondary messenger of GPCR signaling, HTS-amenable assays to detect cAMP are critical for the success of this campaign at NCGC. The cAMP-Glo Max Assay kits from Promega provide a robust and HTS-amenable cAMP-mediated readout to meet this need. As such, NCGC is in need of these reagents, or brand name equal items, to enable early drug discovery efforts against these high value targets.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong>: NCATS is in need of cAMP-Glo Max Assay kits from Promega, or brand name equal items, to enable high-throughput screening campaigns against several opioid-related G-protein coupled receptors targets. cAMP is a secondary messenger of Gs or Gi coupled GPCRs signaling, and activation of these GPCRs leads to activation of inhibition of cAMP production. The cAMP-Glo Max Assay is a homogeneous, bioluminescent, high-throughput assay to measure cyclic AMP levels in cells. It is is based on the principle that cAMP stimulates protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme activity, decreasing available ATP and leading to decreased light production in a coupled luciferase reaction. This kit is sensitive and robust, and will be used for several opioid-related GPCRs projects.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements</strong>: NCATS will need two (2) brand name or equal cAMP assay kits equivalent to the following:</p>
<p>Brand Name Item: cAMP-Glo Max Assay, 10 X 20 Plates.<br />Manufacturer: Promega Corporation.<br />Manufacturer Part Number: V1683.<br />Quantity: Two (2).</p>
<p>Brand name equal items must meet the following salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the brand name item:</p>
<p>&bull; Homogeneous (single step lysis and detection), bioluminescent, high-throughput assay kits to measure cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in cells.<br />&bull; Incubation times &lt;30 mins from addition to detection.<br />&bull; Scalable to 1536-well format.<br />&bull; Compatible with common peristaltic and solenoid valve-based high-throughput dispensers.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong>: September 2018 with a one-time delivery of the items within thirty (30) days after receipt of order (ARO).</p>
<p><strong>Other important considerations</strong>: This&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a brand name or equal requirement for Promega cAMP-Glo Max Assay.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement /information sought</strong>: Contractors believing they can provide brand name or equal items meeting all the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the brand name item should submit documentation of their ability to meet the requirements to the Contract Specialist.</p>

The price quote shall include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, delivery days after contract award, delivery terms, prompt payment discount terms, F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), product or catalog number(s); product description; and any other information or factors that may be considered in the award decision. Such factors may include: past performance; special features required for effective program performance; trade-in considerations; probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item; warranty considerations; maintenance availability; and environmental and energy efficiency considerations.</p>
<p>&bull; Respondents proposing on an equal product of the brand-name product specified in this announcement must provide, as part of their response: (a) product, catalog, model, and/or part number(s); (b) product description; (c) all relevant information and documentation that the item(s) offered meets the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics as specified in the purchase description; quantity; estimated price or cost; shipping, handling, and/or installation charges; and delivery date after receipt of order.</p>
<p>The respondent must also provide their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc., pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>One (1) copy of the response is required and must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format using 11-point or 12-point font, 8-1/2" x 11" paper size, with 1" top, bottom, left and right margins, and with single or double spacing.</p>

Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.



AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors. This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers. No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.

All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

This requirement is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured or  gray market  items will not be accepted.  Gray market,  also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

All software licensing, warrant, and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

To assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside, we are requesting vendors provide the authorized dealer/distributor letter in response to this Request for Information (RFI). Any future solicitation will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment. To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured. This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or 
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.

<DESC>Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio intends to award a Sole Source procurement to Leading Edge Associates, LLC, 702 Tulip Trees Court, Fletcher, NC 28732-9283.
<p>The 910th Airlift Wing primary mission is to maintain the Department of Defense's only large area aerial spray capability to control disease-carrying insects and pest insects. These missions may be executed in combat areas, on installations or in response to disasters/emergencies.  Monitoring the effectiveness of the insecticides ensures the mission's success.  The required systems have different functions.  Fluorescence microscopy is the technique of studying specimen materials that emits fluoresce energy detectable as visible lights when irradiated with the light of a specific wavelength.  Fluorescence microscopy is a used to monitor cell physiology. Microscopy is a wide field that emphasizes the correct use of the different types of laser scanning: confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy, scanning disk confocal microscopy and total internal microscopy.  Droplet measuring system examines droplet arrays though software image analysis of most Kromekote and water sensitive cards.  The system uses a high resolution portable scanner that electronically captures the images of the card samples.</p>
<p>The fluorescence microscope and portable droplet measuring systems specifically for entomology must have the ability to sample airborne droplets in geographic regions that have background particles that can be mistaken for insecticide sampled droplets.  The fluorescence software must be able to eliminate all background particles by only recognizing those that contain a unique fluorescence tracer and provide for the efficient and immediate data analysis of a droplet spectrum to ensure compliance with insecticide labels.  The droplet measuring system portable scanner must have the ability to analyze images of most Kromekote and water sensitive cards as well as incorporate droplet densities per cm2, number of drops read, percent of coverage, total volume and volume density per acre and relative span. Both systems must have the ability to analyze slides from aircraft characterizations and slides positioned at distances drifting downwind of the release point of the spray cloud.  They should also analyze and report EPA label requirements for compliance comparisons.  The systems must have the ability to analyze and accommodate a single slide or an unlimited number of slides from sampling locations.  The softwares should be compatible with a Microsoft Office software for easy importation.</p>
<p>Market Research Assessment determined that the required entomology fluorescence microscopy and droplet measuring systems for aerial sprays are unique to one (1) company.  Fluorescence microscopy may be used for a variety of scientific studies.  However, only the DropVision FL and DropVision AG meet this requirement stated above and the software is proprietary to Leading Edge Associates, LLC.  Therefore, in accordance with FAR 6.301-1(c) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, this will be a sole-source acquisition.  This is a 100 percent small business set-aside.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio.  Reference the attached Justification and Approval document.</p>

This is essential for the research that is funded by our VA Merit Review Grant,  Regulation of Intestinal Inflammation by LRGM1 .

This is not true in the Durham VA animal facility, where mice are endemically infected with norovirus and helicobacter.  Furthermore, the facility has mouse lines of interest at the Duke breeding colony, which are actively being generated there.  In effect, the Duke breeding colony is a unique resource that is essential to complete the specific aims of the facilities sponsored research projects.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price (FFP) award with a period of performance of September 1, 2018   August 31, 2019.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310: Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools with a standard size of $27.5 Million.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong>
<div><strong><br />THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a new type of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft with vectored thrust for control and continuously variable pitch attitude that can change its hovering orientation. It can vary its hover position from "nose up" (tailsitter) to "nose forward" (non-tailsitter) incrementally and continuously, and even hold a position at any angle in between. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent Pending.</div>
<div><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/</div>
<div><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. </strong><br /> <br /></div>

Included in this building is a Class 100 microelectronics fabrication facility, called the Boulder Micro-Fabrication Facility (BMF).  In order to make its smallest features, the BMF uses a JEOL JBX-6300 E-Beam Lithography Tool (tool).  Substrates are loaded into this tool using a cassette.  BMF users need to process on 2-inch wafers and the BMF requires a JEOL JBX-6300 FS 2-inch wafer cassette. The Microfabrication Group of the Quantum Electromagnetics Division, NIST-Boulder requires a JEOL JBX-6300 FS 2-inch wafer cassette to allow BMF users to use the e-beam lithography tool to write on 2-inch wafers.<br />Technical Specifications: One (1) each JEOL JBX-6300 FS 2-inch Multi-Wafer Cassette.</p>
<p>To prevent damage to the JEOL JBX-6300 FS E-Beam Lithography Tool, the cassette must be made to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications.  This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Positioning pins to align wafer and wafer flat.<br />2. Grounding pins<br />3. Height reference plane<br />4. Dimensions and tolerances as required by the manufacturer<br />5. Hook mechanism needed for transfer capture and release<br />6. Software installation</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>To ensure that the JEOL JBX-6300 is not damaged, the BMF requires a factory new JEOL JBX-6300 FS wafer cassette that meets OEM specifications.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>1. The cassette must be able to be used in a JEOL JBX-6300 FS E-Beam Lithography Tool without any modification.</p>
<p>2. The tool must be able to align to the cassette, perform all calibration routines, and write to 2-inch SEMI spec wafers to the tool specifications when the cassette is loaded with wafers and loaded into the JEOL JBX-6300 FS tool.</p>
<p>3. The cassette must be able to hold four 2-inch SEMI spec wafers in the flat on bottom configuration.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing), size standard 1000. No solicitation package will be issued.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a request for competition; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to michael.fredericks@nist.gov.  The government will consider responses received no later than 2pm, MDT, Friday, 31 August 2018.

The Government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Participants in the Hawaii and American Samoa-based longline were previously outfitted with VMS units manufactured by CLS America. The units were purchased by the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) in order to obtain geographic location information for the vessels. The CLS Thorium VMS units are Iridium-based and include proprietary hardware which makes it impossible for other vendors to provide satellite services using these units. This electronic hardware is loaded with electronic reporting software, which will be used for daily electronic reporting within the fleet. In order to support daily reporting, the electronic logbook software is required to submit data through a satellite transmission to PIFSC. Customized software has been developed for PIFSC by CLS America which enables the transmission daily longline catch and effort data.

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>This procurement also requires contractors to complete the electronic representations and certifications at the SAM website. All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM.

Deliverable: Illumina MiSeq System 

Description of work to be performed: a grant to support the VA Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (ShEEP) was approved specifically for the purchase of an Illumina MiSeq system. The purpose of the grant is to study the gut microbiome in numerous health conditions that affect Veterans to include colorectal cancer, Gulf War Illness, Parkinson s disease, traumatic brain injury and type 1 diabetes. To carry out this research, the Government requires use of the Illumina MiSeq system to sequence the 16S hypervariable region of bacterial rRNA. Fecal samples will be the starting source of material from which DNA will be isolated. The DNA will then be prepared for sequencing by synthesis biochemistry and enzymology in an automated fashion on the MiSeq system. The sequence data will be aligned with the appropriate genome data alone after excluding variant calls. Based on sequence alignment, the Government will compute alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, determine the number of operational taxonomic units, carry out weighted principle coordinate analysis for the bacterial genera represented and then construct cladograms, box charts and heat maps of the resulting data.

<DESC><strong>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</strong>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation ("synopsitation" hereafter), which is expected to result in award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for commercial items, i.e. Triple Horn, as described under the attachment titled "Statement of Work." The synopsitation is prepared in accordance with (IAW) the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is conducted as a commercial item procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13). An award, if any, will be made to the responsible offeror who submits a proposal that (1) conforms to the requirements of the synopsitation; (2) complies with the minimum requirements stated in the Statement of Work (SOW) by providing a complete description of the items provided; and (3) submits the proposal with the lowest total evaluated price (TEP), provided that the TEP is not unbalanced and is determined to be fair and reasonable. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award at all depending upon (1) the quality of proposals received and (2) whether proposed prices are determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Offerors must include the country of manufacturer, as well as the offeror's Tax Identification Number (TIN) within the proposal.</strong></p>
<p>Synopsitation Number:<strong> FA8601-18-Q-0212</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is a <strong>Full and Open Competition</strong> under North American Industry<br />Classification <strong>(NAICS) Code 339992</strong> with a <strong>Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees.</strong></p>
<p>Synopsitation Closing Date: <strong>Proposals must be received no later than 9:00 am, Eastern Time on 7 September 2018.</strong></p>
<p>Submit electronic proposals via e-mail to: <strong>kelli.locker@us.af.mil.</strong><br />Any correspondence sent via e-mail must contain the subject line:<br /><strong>"Triple Horn - 0212."</strong></p>
<p>The entire proposal must be contained in a single e-mail that does not exceed five (5) megabytes including attachments, if any. E-mails with compressed files are not permitted. Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe or .zip files). Therefore, if the specified subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for its past performance history.
(c) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all
options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is
unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the
Government to exercise the option(s).
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful
offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without
further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of

existing Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each suppliers performance history by
Federal supply class (FSC) and product or service code (PSC). The SPRS application provides the
contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery
performance for the FSC and PSC of the supplies being purchased.
(c) The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in SPRS will be used by the
contracting officer to evaluate a suppliers past performance in conjunction with the suppliers references
