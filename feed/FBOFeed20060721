<DESC>If any 8(a), Hubzone or Service Disabled Veteran can perform this work, provide notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days of this announcement. Notification must include technical qualifications sufficient to perform the below stated requirements.  In addition, include demonstrated experience in developing seismic data acquisition and analysis systems.  If there is no response from any of the above mentioned concerns no further notice will be released and the solicitation will be issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Central Geologic Hazards Team, Advanced National Seismic Network (ANSS) Project is working towards improving the completeness, reliability, and timeliness of seismic information available from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), which acts as the national operation center for the ANSS Program.  This information serves earthquake hazard responders, public officials, the media, the seismological research and earthquake engineerng communities, and the general public.  The ANSS project is an integrated effort including the extension and maintenane of the real-time ANSS national backbone seismograph network (formerly the U.S. National Seismograph Network); This effort requires custom real-time programming of the field processors (at the stations) and interface software at cooperating data centers, handling telemetry on satellite and terrestrial links under TCP/IP protocols, and acquiring, processing, managing, archiving, and distributing data at the NEIC.  This task is significantly complicated by the fact that a variety of different types of stations (using different types of data acquisition systems) are received in real-time either directly or mediated by a variety of data center hardware and software and received over various private and public wide area computer networks.  The contractor works independently on systems that are very complex to analyze, plan, program, and operate.  Participates in all phases of planning, system design, prototyping, development, testing, documentation, and software maintenance.  Develops general data management and scientific/engineering analysis applications and real-time data acquisition and process control applications.  Develops, supports and interfaces with highly specialized real-time field data acquisition software.  Participates in the monitoring and maintenance of applications and systems software to ensure maximum up time of existing and newly developed software in an active operational environment.  Provides limited system support including hardware fault recovery and the installation of new layered systems software packages.  All work will be performed on existing government owned equipment, including Compaq Alpha computers running under the Open VMS operating system, DEC LSI-11 computers running under the RT-11 operating system, Motorola 68000 VME Bus based systems running under the OS-9 operating system, Sun computers running under the Solaris (UNIX) operating system, and Intel based PCs running under the Windows XP and Windows 2003 operating systems.  Security background investigation will be required.  All work will be done at the NEIC within 130-160 hours per month, beginning on the date of award (est. to be o/a September 25, 2006), and shall continue through twelve months with four one-year option periods.  Note that in case of a rare emergency involving significant loss of irreplaceable data, the monitoring and maintenance activity requires that the contractor shall, upon notification by the Government of an emergency situation within the contractor's area of responsibility, immediately begin work to resolve the crisis by means of patches, work-arounds, etc. on a 24-hour/day, 7-day/week basis. The solicitation will be available o/a August 7, 2006 at the following web address:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov/.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be available.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted.  The Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this project is 541512.  See Numbered Note 1.

<CONTACT>Jeanine Passetti, XXX-XXX-XXXX
<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Performance Technologies to purchase an Advanced Managed Platfrom for the following reasons: The Flight Service and Weather Engineering Team (AJW-176) is in process of re-hosting the Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) Data Acquisition System (ADAS) to a new architecture. Part of the new system requires that new hardware be deployed at the FAA's Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) to connect the existing weather sensors, (that utilizes the legacy High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol) to the FAA's Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) Internet Protocol (IP) network.   An engineering study was performed and the document "Enhanced ADAS Operational Sensor Support Capability" V0.6 Dated 4/24/06 was created. This document discusses the technology and the evaluation process for the type of devices (generically known as protocol converters) that support data sent over the serial HDLC communication links and encapsulates that information so that it can be transmitted over an IP network. After extensive research and review it was determined that Performance Technologies (PT) had the best solution that meets and exceeds the ADAS specification. Their product line (the Advances Managed Platform) provides a hardware solution that offers a high port density in a small form factor. The AMP5091 offers a modular I/O platform that supports up to 56 ports in a 4U 19" rack mounted chassis. In addition PT's hardware solution is based upon hot-swappable I/O modules and power supplies. (Details can be found at (http://www.pt.com/products/prod_amp5091.html - also see attachment). Note, Each I/O module supports 8 ports that requires two 4-port Hydra-cables >From a functional perspective, PT can support the variant of the HDLC protocol used by the sensors directly within their product line. In addition, PT offers a commercial off the self (COTS), solution that in the long run makes this the best value especially when it comes to supportability in the future.   Based on the above, Performance Technologies is the only source with the product to meet the HDLC protocol solution for ADAS.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Jeanine Passetti, Contracting Officer, by 4 p.m. Eastern Time, July 24, 2006.

<DESC>Any questions or comments pertaining to this action shall be faxed to (505) 284-7174, Attn: David Nienow, NNSA Contract Specialist, not later than Aug 04, 2006. The U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) intends to procure, on a sole item/sole source basis, 22 each Knights PN 23241 SR-25 battle rifle with 16Ã¢â‚¬Â barrel and 5 each Knights PN 21035-1 MK-11 MOD-0 20Ã¢â‚¬Â barrel (a sole item) from Knights Armament Company, 701 Columbia Blvd Titusville, FL 32780 (a sole source) to satisfy requirements of the NNSA Office of Secure Transportation (OST). NNSA OST has determined that Knights PN 23241 SR-25 and Knights PN 21035-1 MK-11 MOD-0 are the only items capable of meeting NNSA OST mission requirements, and Knights Armament Company is the only firm capable of providing this product as the sole SR-25 authorized representative. This procurement is a Small Business Set-Aside, and Knights Armament Company is a Small Business under North American Industrial Classification Code 332994 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The initial NNSA decision to select Knights PN 23241 SR-25 and Knights PN 21035-1 MK-11 MOD-0 was based on test and evaluations conducted by NNSA/NSO Special Response Team.  The team conducted a test and evaluation of the SR-25 in 2004 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) range training facility and the Sandia National laboratories (SNL) and US Army tests. The Department of Energy and the NNSA/NSO Special Response Team have a requirement for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“familyÃ¢â‚¬Â of semi-automatic 7.62 NATO weapons that share common training, logistics and supply with as many federal and Government Agencies as possible in order to achieve the maximum life-cycle-cost savings.  This purchase supplements the current inventory of standardized weapons in the DOE arsenal and allows simplified logistics within the DOE security complex. Accordingly, the NNSA Service Center intends to conduct this sole item/sole source procurement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and no other sources will be considered. A public solicitation will not be available. This notice satisfies the requirement of FAR Part 5 for publicizing contract opportunities. The acquisition is expected to extend 180 days after contract award. Any questions or comments pertaining to this action shall be faxed to (505) 284-7174, Attn: David Nienow, NNSA Contract Specialist, not later than Aug 04, 2006. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR A FORMAL PROPOSAL OR A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace in accordance with FAR Part 5. All feedback received will be taken into consideration, however the agency reserves the right to not utilize the comments or any other information provided. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. NNSA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this Notice. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

Location of this project:  13 miles east of Butte, Montana - Silver Bow County A site visit has been scheduled for:  Wednesday, August 16, 2006, at  9:00 AM. Participants meet at:  Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Butte Field Office, 106 N. Parkmont, Butte, MT.  Potential offerors are to provide their own transportation at no cost to the Government.

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.  The building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal state and municipal buildings are organized.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further façade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior.   The delivery method for this project will be Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc).   The Government will select a CMc to serve as General Contractor providing pre-construction and construction services.  The CMc will provide design phase consultations evaluating costs, schedule, alternative design implications, building systems, and construction materials.  The CMc will serve as the single point of responsibility during construction, contracting directly with subcontractors.  The Government will solicit proposals under a source selection process for CMc.  Selection will be based on a combination of technical and price factors that provide the best value to the Government.  

SCOPE OF WORK
The design responsibilities will include, but are not necessarily limited to, architectural historic preservation as related to the following items of work:  replacement of nearly all of the existing deteriorated terra cotta cladding with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials and new non-ferrous supports and anchorage devices on the facades of the 1933 structure;  retention, restoration, re-pointing and cleaning of existing terra cotta at window surrounds wherever possible; repair, cleaning, and re-pointing of the existing granite cladding on the facades of both the 1892 and 1933 structures;  hazardous materials investigation and abatement;  replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system and associated wood decking and lead coated copper gutters, flashing, valleys and ridges on both the 1892 and 1933 structures;  and installation of a fall protection/prevention system at the slate mansard roof to facilitate periodic maintenance of perimeter gutters and drains. 

The Scope of A/E Services under this Firm-Fixed Price Contract will include, but are not necessarily limited to: Field Inspections, Surveys, Examinations, Sampling and Testing, Documentation, Architectural/Engineering Design, Preparation of Specifications and CAD drawings for Construction Documents, Value Engineering, Partnering, Cost Estimating and Interior Design/Space Planning for temporary tenant relocations.  Optional Construction Phase services will include, but may not be limited to:  Partnering, Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS), Construction Inspection Services (CIS), As-Built Drawings and other related services.  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements. 

This building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places  and is a New York City Landmark.  Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the New York State Historic Preservation Officer (NYSHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106.   As deemed necessary during the design and final documents preparation process, and at a minimum for the Pre-Design submission, the A/E will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and proposed solutions.    A Memorandum of Agreement with the NYSHPO, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation is already in place.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) on Collapsible Shipping and Storage Containers, 800 lbs.   This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(c).  The intent of the RFI is to identify potential suppliers of containers capable of ultimately providing this requirement in large quantities for the Department of Defense.  It is the Navy's intention to procure small quantities of approximately 4 different containers for test and evaluation (Needed in Nov/Dec 06).  Following test and evaluation, a procurement of several hundred containers for use in a military exercise is planned (needed by Feb/Mar 07) in conjunction with a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD).  This JCTD is evaluating the Joint Modular Intermodal Container (JMIC) as part of the Joint Modular Intermodal Distribution System (JMIDS). JMIC is expected to be a family of containers potentially including both heavy duty containers (for materials such as ordnance), and lighter duty containers (the subject of this solicitation). If that evaluation demonstrates effectiveness of the JMIC concept, and of the procured containers, the Department of Defense may procure large quantities of similar containers, for general use within the Defense Transportation System (FY-08 and beyond).  The future containers will have a common footprint and interface and may also include other heights as well as multiples of the basic footprints for items too large to fit within the basic footprint (double long, double wide, etc).

This is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor can there be any claims levied against the Government as a result of any information submitted by respondents.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   Potential uses for the information received may result in future Request for Quotation’s (RFQs), but knowledge of this cannot be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "href=http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S.Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-4243. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "http://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.cfm" Drawings are not available. First Article Testing and Production Lot testing are required for this procurement. The cost of FAT is $500.00 and the cost for PLT is $500.00. These costs will be added to all offers as an evaluation factor. -SEE NOTES 9, 26

This contract provides a facility for holding and breeding of experimental animals in support of research of the EIB.  Multiple strains are bred for experimental needs, when such animals are not available commercially.  This includes the breeding of multiple transgenic and “knock-out” mice, some of which are generated by EIB investigators.  This contract permits investigators to import mice from other laboratories unusual mouse strains that may carry infectious agents including viruses.  A quarantine room complete with sterile barriers is maintained so those mice from outside sources can be screened for pathogens.  Mice in the EIB colony are routinely maintained in microisolator housing to prevent the spread of infectious agents that might be introduced into the facility.  The other major aspect of the contact provides for the performance of experimental procedures in support of the research. This includes many routine animal procedures such as the collection of blood, other tissues, palpation of tumors, and immunization, as well as preparation and injection of murine hematopoietic and lymphoid cells.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Aerotech, Inc. for two 4 Axis Computerized Motion Control Systems.  Each system shall be a complete 4 axis computer-controlled, linear servo-motor based positioning systems, comprised of three stages of 50 mm travel and one stage of 200 mm travel, a motion controller/amplifier chassis, and associated cables and software, for construction of a multi-axis interferometry experiment.  All four linear stages must meet the following specified values:
1.	Bidirectional repeatability: plus/minus 100 nm or better.
2.	Minimum incremental motion: 30 nm or smaller.
3.	Encoder period: 20 microns or smaller.
4.	Position stability: plus/minus 10 nm or better.
5.	Pitch/yaw: 50 microradians or better for all four axes.
6.	Accuracy: plus/minus 0.5 microns or better, over the entire travel of the stage.
Our market research has concluded only Aerotech’s components meet the following requirements:
a.	Stage design: We require compact stages capable of highly precise and accurate positioning at the submicron scale, which do not employ a motor external to the motion table.  To be compatible with the design of our experiment, all four stages must be usable in an inverted (upside-down) position without a loss of performance.  Furthermore, the mounting surfaces of all four stages must be at the same height, and this height must not exceed 50 mm. 
b.	The only technology that can meet these requirements are stages that employ center-mounted, direct-drive linear motors.  Screw-driven stepper motor or servo-motor stages are not acceptable, because windup, stiction, and backlash effects in the drive-screw mechanism, limit their ability to consistently meet the positioning specifications.
c.	Each stage must utilize a non-contact linear encoder mounted inside the stage body between the roller guides, with a 20 micron or better resolution, with hardware multiplication to achieve a resolution value of 30 nm or better. This technology is required to verify the precision and accuracy of motion. “Open-loop” systems, or systems in which the linear encoders are of lower than 20 micron resolution, or systems in which the encoder is mounted on the side of the stage, are not acceptable because they compromise the positioning accuracy.  Interferometer-based positioning systems are also not acceptable because they will not be compatible with the mechanical and optical requirements of our design.
d.	Motion systems with stages of different heights are not acceptable because the experimental design requires hardware to be mounted at the same height at all four axes.
e.	Controller design: A single motion control unit must contain all servo amplifiers and signal processing hardware for the system, and must be usable with existing laboratory PCs.  We require that only one cable 12 feet or longer connects each stage to the motion control unit.  Stages that require multiple connectors to the control unit would compromise the compactness and reliability of the setup.  Cable lengths of less than 12 feet are unacceptable, because they would place the RF-and heat-generating control unit near sensitive equipment, and thus compromise performance.  We also require that computer-motion controller communication be accomplished via firewire, Ethernet, or serial interfaces without requiring the installation of specialized PCI cards.  This requirement is to ensure that existing laboratory computers can be interfaced with the motion control system.  Furthermore, the controller unit must be expandable so that it can control at least two more axes of motion for future experiments. 
f.	Software: The motion control system must be usable with the MS Windows operating system, which is already installed on the existing computers in the laboratory. Furthermore, the system must be provided with Labview-drivers, so that it can be used with an extensive body of existing laboratory software already present in the laboratory.  
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred). Anticipated award date is August 11, 2006.

<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC) has a requirement for Mission Assurance Services to extend the current contract for 6 month. NASA's GSFC intends to award a sole-source contract extension to SRS Technologies Information Services Division (SRS) pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-00241 for up to 6 months and increase the maximum ordering value, in support of NASA's GSFC Office of Systems Safety and Mission Assurance (OSSMA).	The extension will be structured as a 3-month basic period and three 1-month option periods.     The current contractor provides the following services to NASA's GSFC OSSMA: personnel, materials and facilities to provide Mission Assurance Engineering Services, System Safety Services, Reliability Services, Continuous Risk Management Services, and Information Technology Services. These services provide a wide range of support and are essential to the NASA's GSFC mission. This work relates to safety and is essential for mission success.  SRS has managed the current contract for the past 5 years and has the infrastructure in place to provide these services on short notice, for the brief period of the extension. The current contractor has the experience, management skills, and trained personnel to carry out the day-to-day operations and meet required schedules.  Due to the time and duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, SRS is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA's needs given the minimal period of performance for the extension. Any other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the NASA's GSFC Office and contact listed above.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a sophisticated materials analyzer that can characterize an unknown material in great detail. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Quantum Analytics.  Quantum Analytics provides an instrument called the Frontier Pyrolyzer System. This instrument has unique technology and capabilities that no other company provides, or could provide. The technology provides the user with a choice of temperature gradients for the initial introduction of the sample into the pyrolysis chamber. The temperature gradient will be below the decomposition temperature of the sample and the evolved gas can be characterized and identified by the accompanying gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry system. After the gas analysis is completed, the sample is raised to the top of the pyrolyzer and cooled to room temperature. The pyrolysis chamber is then heated to temperatures above the initial gas evolution temperature and the sample is allowed to fall into the heated pyrolysis chamber. This process allows for the analysis of non-volatile components of the same sample.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on July 28th, 2006.

The Flight Training Device (FTD) will be located at the NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen, Germany. The existing NE-3A Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT) is to be upgraded to US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or European Joint Aviation Authority (JAA) equivalent, Level 6/7 FTD as defined by FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 120-45A to include fully integrated/operable navigator station.  NE-3A FTD should also be fully convertible to provide Level 6/7 B-707 Transport/Cargo Aircraft training capability. As a flight crew trainer, today the CPT can only be considered equivalent to and FAA Level-1 FTD because of the CPT lack of fidelity with the aircraft in a number of key areas, particularly pilot’s instrumentation and flight controls.  Level-1 is the designation for any device that cannot meet the standards of any other level and is not required to meet any qualification criteria. CPT upgrade to FTD shall achieve the following objectives; a.	Enhanced Flight Crew Training b.	Enhanced Maintenance Training c.	Provide B-707/TCA Training d.	Overcome CPT Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Issues e.	Improve Crew Resource Management (CRM)

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Carter Center, Atlanta, GA.  

Purpose:

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), in compliance with its knowledge development and application mission, seeks to influence service systems change beneficial to persons with serious mental illness.  The Division of Service and Systems Improvement (DSSI) in CMHS has initiated a broad program of knowledge communication and application in areas where there is a high demand for information and where there is information available regarding evidence-based practices.  One of the priority areas for services development within the SAMHSA matrix of priorities is prevention and treatment for older person with mental illness. Another priority for SAMHSA, as stated in the President’s New Freedom Commission Final Report (2003) is “Better coordination is needed between mental health care and primary health care” (p.23). Particularly for older adults, there is a critical need to achieve this goal of better integration of behavioral and primary healthcare because this is what older consumers want and because it more efficiently meets the needs of older consumers who often present with multiple and complex health and behavioral health needs. Evidence-based practices have been established in the area of behavioral health and primary care integration for older adults, but this information requires widespread dissemination and efforts toward implementation in the field. Major depression imposes the greatest disability burden of any mental or general medical condition in the United States.  
The Carter Center is uniquely qualified to conduct the project described in this requirement The Government could not achieve the specific objectives of this contract through any other means or with any other resources. In 1991, Rosalynn Carter developed The Carter Center Mental Health Task Force, to guide the activities of The Carter Center Mental Health Program and to improve mental health care by supporting the implementation of policy change, and to develop initiatives to reduce stigma and discrimination.  The Mental Health Program is currently engaged as a leading, organizational entity in an important, high profile, national initiative for changing and improving the public policy environment for treating depression in primary care.  The Mental Health Program’s national stature, convening power, and reputation as an honest broker make it uniquely qualified to bring together representatives from the public and private, as well as nongovernmental sectors to identify policy barriers to real-world implementation and to develop action steps for bringing evidence-based models to complex practice settings.  A specific strength of The Carter Center Mental Health Program is the ability to facilitate and promote policy change by identifying key stake holders and decision makers and bringing them together to undertake collective action.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families, Office of Community Services (OCS) has a requirement to provide timely and specialized technical assistance in the performance of the Federal level administration of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  The OCS intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Apprise Incorporated, 403 Wall Street, Princeton, NJ  08540-1504 to assist in responding to LIHEAP-related questions and assignments from the DHHS, Congress, Office of Management and Budget, Congressional Research Service, Government Accountability Office, LIHEAP grantees and other interested parties.  A significant portion of the data requests will deal with low income, home energy related data that will need to be obtained from the core and LIHEAP supplemental sample files from the U.S. Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Residential Energy Consumption Surveys (RECS) and the National Energy Assistance Directors National Energy Assistance Surveys.  A labor hour award with a fixed price ceiling shall be made under the terms of FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The period of performance is one year from date of award, with 4 one year option periods.  The cumulative total for the 5 years shall not exceed $100,000.  The Contractor shall be on call to provide technical assistance in the following areas:  (1) review and analysis of energy assistance studies; (2) development of performance measurements, such as developing LIHEAP outcome measures in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act and OMB’s Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) and assist in the planning for the next LIHEAP PART; (3) perform data collection; (4) development of residential energy price trend methodology for low income households, review methodology of LIHEAP studies funded by Congressional earmarks and refine LIHEAP allocation formula methodology; (5) computer support for LIHEAP electronic forms and publishing of OCS-funded LIHEAP data/studies/reports to meet Section 508 requirements on web accessibility; and (6) evaluation assistance to LIHEAP grantees.  Apprise Incorporated has been justified on a sole source basis because Apprise staff have directed the household interviews of the 2003 and 2005 National Energy Assistance Survey of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association; staff are in a unique position to provide special tabulations from the surveys; only Apprise is currently able to access the restricted RECS data files due to an interagency agreement between OCS and EIA; and finally it would take another contractors staff a significant amount of time to become knowledgeable about LIHEAP related statistics, RECS, low income-energy related data and LIHEAP performance measurements.  Interested parties may identify their knowledge of the subject matter, their ability to have staff ready to provide technical assistance to OCS and their capability to meet the Government’s requirements as expressed in this synopsis by submitting a capability statement.  No solicitation document is available.  Reference Note 22.  [Responses of capability are due 15 days after publication of this notice; authority to negotiate on a sole source basis is FAR 13.106-1(b).]

<DESC>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR
THE USAID OFFICE OF FOOD FOR PEACE


A.	BACKGROUND

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), provides administrative, technical and financial oversight for the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) Title II program. Title II represents the largest amount of United States Government (USG) resources committed to global food insecurity, providing over $7 billion of assistance since 2001. FFP makes available Title II resources to private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IO), primarily the World Food Program (WFP), and foreign governments to address food insecurity resulting from short term emergencies and longer term development problems in food deficit countries. 

Title II programs operate in an environment characterized by increased frequency and severity of natural and manmade disasters; the heightened diplomatic, military and humanitarian demands on the U.S., including the war on terrorism; and the destabilizing potential of HIV/AIDS, conflict, and increased numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons. 

Under the new FFP Strategy Plan for 2006-2010 (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp), FFP has expanded its basic food security conceptual framework to make explicit the risks (economic, social, health and political risks as well as natural shocks) that impede progress toward improvements in food availability, access and utilization.  

Efforts to improve the measurement of Title II impact will continue under the new strategy.  This will include activities to assess the impact of the program on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) goal to reduce the prevalence of underweight children under five and improve the measures of food access and community coping capacity.  FFP will also put more emphasis on knowledge management under the new strategy, expanding its knowledge of what works and why and using this knowledge to influence policy and improve program impact in the field.  Under the new strategy, Title II programs will fall into one of two categories:  Single-Year Assistance Programs (SYAPs) or Multi-Year Assistance Programs (MYAPs) (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp).  

B.	OVERALL OBJECTIVES

The contractor shall assist FFP to achieve its strategic objective through the realization of the following objectives: 

Objective 1: 	Provide administrative, technical, and program support in the planning, implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of Public Law (P.L.) 480 Title II SYAPs and MYAPs. 

Objective 2:  	Provide technical support to the Program Operations Division for calls forward, procurement tracking, booking, shipping, budget analysis and presentations.

Objective 3:	Support the review, administrative, monitoring and evaluation process for FFP’s Institutional Support Assistance programs to Cooperating Sponsors (CS).

Objective 4:	Support the planning, organization, and follow-up actions to the Food Aid Consultative Working Group.

Objective 5: 	Assist FFP to develop a standard training package and help modify or develop technical training modules and facilitate training sessions related to P.L. 480 Title II food aid program implementation, monitoring and evaluation. 			 

Objective 6: 	Provide administrative and information support in the areas of report writing and material updates, as well as modify (or develop) and implement a public relations, communication and outreach strategy for FFP.  

Objective 7: 	Provide operational support. 



C.       CONTRACT TYPE

<DESC>It is the intent of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Humanetics Pharmaceuticals, Chanhassen, MN, to identify and investigate if an Investigational New Drug, BIO 300, can be used as a countermeasure for exposure to ionizing radiation.  Humanetics Pharmaceuticals will explore the application of the BIO 300 in basic and clinical research studies. Humanetics Pharmaceuticals will conduct three research studies:  1) A Dose Escalation Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 Capsules at Five Doses in Humans.  The intent of this clinical trial is to develop additional pharmacokinetic and safety data for BIO 300 capsules in humans at the dose level anticipated for efficacy based upon preclinical studies.; 2)  A Dose Escalation Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 Capsules at Five Doses in a Large Animal Model.  The intent of this large animal trial is to maximize information collected from animals while considering their biological similarities to humans. The animal species selected should be similar to humans with respect to the pharmacokinetic profile of the agent.  The selection of an appropriate animal species for this work requires a comprehensive evaluation of those variables that are specific to the disease process that is being studied.; 3)  Mathematical Molecular Modeling to Screen Agents for Potential Use as Medical Radiation Countermeasures.  Exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation may cause deficits in the immune system, along with other syndromes known collectively as acute radiation syndrome (ARS).  High mortality rates can occur in as little as two to four weeks after exposure to radiation if the immune system is negatively affected.  The Contractor is required to develop, or license the ability to utilize, a computer model to mathematically characterize the two-dimensional molecular topology of known radioprotectants or radiotherapeutics as a means to generate a training set that will predict other compounds with similar mathematical attributes and characteristics.   Potential compounds identified by the mathematical model will subsequently be assayed in an animal screening model by the Government to determine levels of efficacy.   The objective is to utilize the mathematical model to generate new lead candidates for development as radioprotectants or radiotherapeutics.  The period of performance will be for two years with the option to extend services.  The statutory authority permitting this award under other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as cited in FAR 6.302-1(a) that authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University proposes to negotiate a contract, on a sole source basis, with Inologic, Inc. to conduct research on Inositol Signaling Molecules.  This action is being undertaken under the authority at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The overall aim of this effort is to develop a small molecule inositol polyphosphate drug that prevents and/or reverses the deleterious effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.  In normal cells intrinsic pathways exist to repair radiation induced damage through activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Inositol signaling molecules are key components of intracellular signaling and figure prominently in the regulation of radiation repair mechanisms and it is expected that analogues of specific inositol-signaling molecules (ISM) can be developed that could be used in a very specific manner to affect DNA double strand repair breaks and boost cell repair processes. This ISM analog would act as a radioprotective agent that could be used to protect cells from radiation damage and could restore or protect bone marrow progenitor cells.  This contract seeks to identify lead candidate ISMs that can be moved forward for further development and testing in models as radiation countermeasures.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT ; The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking contractor assistance in conducting VA disability examinations for veterans who have filed for VA disability compensation or pension.  The performance period is 24 months and this contract is performance based. The reports generated from these examinations are necessary to adjudicate the claims filed by these veterans.  The following geographic locations require vendor assistance in which the vendor will be responsible for locating examiners in which to conduct the disability examinations:  New Orleans and Alexandria, Louisiana; and Bernalillo, Sandoval, Santa Fe, Taos, Rio Arriba, San Juan, Chaves, and Eddy counties in New Mexico.  If additional funding becomes available during the 24 months of this contract term, the vendor may also be responsible for conducting examinations in one or more of the additional geographical areas. Under Public Law 108-183, section 704, Congress granted VA temporary authority, not to exceed December 31, 2009, to contract out for examinations which is in addition to the authority provided in section 504(b) of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-275; 38 U.S.C. 5101 note).  The applicable NAICS codes are 621111 and 621112.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to issue solicitation number BEP-06-0019. Please note the uploaded attachments to this solicitation.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), Western Currency Facility (WCF), located at 9000 Blue Mound Road, Fort Worth, Texas, has a need to procure for a materials handling solution in the COPE section. The successful Contractor will be tasked with providing a commercially available system which will automatically transfer currency bricks from the discharge end of the COPE presses and stack them in the proper numerical sequence for packing and shipping in the Cash Pack section.  The Contractor will be required to provide a system taking into consideration space constraints, equipment function, layout, power requirements and anticipated equipment output. The equipment will also have the capability of being modified by BEP personnel to suit changing process requirements. It is highly recommended that the Contractor make a site visit in order to properly address these requirements. 

Under this contract, the Contractor shall provide labor, materials, fabrication, assembly, delivery, installation, testing, training and all other efforts necessary for a turn key operation in the manufacture of a COPE Robotic Automation Device solution (including Labor & Materials, Engineering services, hardware and software) to automate the staking and labeling process inside the Currency Overprinting and Processing Equipment Section (COPES) in accordance with Section C of this document, for the Western Currency Facility (WCF) in Fort Worth, Texas. The procurement and installation of this equipment is intended to be a research and development prototype to aid and enable the COPE Section to operate in a more efficient manner, and will establish a basis to aid BEP in making the decision to pursue the acquisition of additional equipment to automate the entire COPE section in both of its currency manufacturing facilities in Washington DC and Forth Worth, TX.  

The Government anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price contract for a base period and reserves the express right and privilege to exercise the option to procure several additional system from the same successful (contractor) bidder if it is deemed to be in the best interest of the BEP to extend stacking and labeling automation throughout the entire COPE Section without any further solicitation when additional systems (options) are needed and exercised.

ITEM DESCRIPTION:

Quantity    	Description     				
1 Ea		Telescope Controller
		
NAICS Code:  333314

2.  This is a SOLE SOURCE acquisition to DFM Engineering, Inc., a small business.  The Telescope Controller will be used in teaching cadets at the United States Air Force Academy in Physics 215, 370, 371 and 480.  The Physics Dept. uses the telescope in the observatory to demonstrate basic principles of physics to core cadets, as well as instructing cadets in advanced Physics classes on the uses of telescopes for remote sensing, satellite identification, and deep space observation.  In order to achieve these goals, the Physics Dept. needs to upgrade the control system which points the telescopes.  The current motors, gimbals, mounting and slow motion controls are still in good working order; however, the automated control system which runs the mechanical pieces of the USAFA telescope needs to be replaced.  The current control system only runs on the oldest computer at USAFA and cannot be upgraded to a newer computer system.  The new upgraded control system should include a hand-held paddle, a user friendly control system allowing the user to point to any astronomical object in the sky.  This control system will consist of a personal computer running Windows XP, a commercial software package, and a motor drive chassis to provide mechanical linkage to the current stepper motors on the telescope.  This new control system will provide the ability for a user to create custom user interface.  Control electronics must be able to be located up to 150 feet from the telescope for remote control of the telescope.  A built in library of objects in the sky to include stars, planets, comets, and satellites must also be provided in this control system.  In addition, this system must provide operation and display with any astronomical epoch; hybrid digital/analog servo controllers with zero position error integrator.  Controller and pointing model must achieve 10 to 20 arc second blind pointing to a 60 degree zenith distance; a single DC servo motor per axis for connection to the telescope, hand-held paddles must include guide, set, slew focus and dome left right commands;  a system control for a focus stepper motor with potentiometer as the position sensor; Mercury limit switch to prevent telescope over-travel; gold plated electrical connectors for long electronics lifetime and full wiring schematics provided with system to allow for maintenance.   This controller will be used in conjunction with the USAFA Observatory telescopes.  The upgraded telescope control system consists of Part Number WinTCS-006ST Advanced Telescope Controller with interconnect cables to the existing Motor Driver Chassis (MDC), software, installation, checkout, operator training, and documentation.  This upgrade also includes Satellite tracking capability.  The US Government [through the USAF Academy] has an agreement to Restricted Data Rights for the drawings and the software for the telescope and the control system with DFM Engineering, Inc.  As such, DFM Engineering, Inc. is the only source capable of meeting the Government’s requirement.  This Notice of Proposed Contract Action is the only solicitation submitted for this requirement.  No formal solicitation will be issued prior to award.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  It should be noted that faxed quotations will be accepted.  The faxed quotation can be sent to (719)333-9103.  Email quotations will also be accepted and can be emailed to cherish.driver@usafa.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a modification of solicitation number HC1047-06-T-4031 to extend the closing date and time to 2:00PM EST, 31 July 2006. 

This modification also provides answers to comments received,  regarding this solicitation. See below.

1: Who will be on the evaluation committee?  The proposals will be evaluated by qualified technical personnel, GCCS-J subject matter experts, and business office representatives.

2: Have members of the evaluation team seen a demonstration(s) of business intelligence tools?  If so, which products have been demonstrated?  Some of the members of the evaluation team may have seen demonstration of some functionality of various commercially available tools, but this is not relevant to the current business opportunity..  No demonstration is desired  - the evaluation will be done based upon written proposals.

3: The GCCS-J Force Readiness and Force Planning Business Intelligence (BI) tool pricing matrix asks for 20 licenses for each year (FY06-FY08).  Please clarify the request in terms of:
•	Named users -  This information is not relevant or available.  It will be used by Government personnel. 
•	CPU’s -  The licenses are per server. 
•	Other -  N/A. 

4: For engineering support/training (labor) please clarify the work to be performed in terms of installation, development and training.  Please provide an estimation regarding number of users trained from an administration and end user perspective.  Engineering support is needed to answer questions concerning installation, configuration, and/or development work.  Specific subject matter content of customization will be decided after purchase and during implementation of the tool.  If training is embedded in the tool, it should be available to an unlimited amount of users.  

5: GCCS-J indicates the evaluation scoring will deduct points for certain criteria.   Are all categories weighted equally or do some hold more weight?  Please describe the weighting matrix.  N/A, however, two areas important to DOD are functionality and security.

6: Will the government consider a 1 week controlled validation phase with the top two vendors?  The Government will consider this option, however, it is unlikely that this will be required.

All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development (USDA RD) anticipates awarding a three to five year, fixed rate, blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for accommodations to house temporarily relocated personnel from Washington, DC to the Raleigh, North Carolina area if a natural or man-made disaster prevents the performance of continued critical operating functions of the Agency.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR
THE USAID OFFICE OF FOOD FOR PEACE


A.	BACKGROUND

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), provides administrative, technical and financial oversight for the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) Title II program. Title II represents the largest amount of United States Government (USG) resources committed to global food insecurity, providing over $7 billion of assistance since 2001. FFP makes available Title II resources to private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IO), primarily the World Food Program (WFP), and foreign governments to address food insecurity resulting from short term emergencies and longer term development problems in food deficit countries. 

Title II programs operate in an environment characterized by increased frequency and severity of natural and manmade disasters; the heightened diplomatic, military and humanitarian demands on the U.S., including the war on terrorism; and the destabilizing potential of HIV/AIDS, conflict, and increased numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons. 

Under the new FFP Strategy Plan for 2006-2010 (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp), FFP has expanded its basic food security conceptual framework to make explicit the risks (economic, social, health and political risks as well as natural shocks) that impede progress toward improvements in food availability, access and utilization.  

Efforts to improve the measurement of Title II impact will continue under the new strategy.  This will include activities to assess the impact of the program on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) goal to reduce the prevalence of underweight children under five and improve the measures of food access and community coping capacity.  FFP will also put more emphasis on knowledge management under the new strategy, expanding its knowledge of what works and why and using this knowledge to influence policy and improve program impact in the field.  Under the new strategy, Title II programs will fall into one of two categories:  Single-Year Assistance Programs (SYAPs) or Multi-Year Assistance Programs (MYAPs) (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp).  

B.	OVERALL OBJECTIVES

The contractor will assist FFP to achieve its strategic objective through the realization of the following objectives: 

	Objective 1: 	Assist in the planning, management, technical and administration support of PL 480, Title II grants and cooperative agreements.

	Objective 2:  	Provide technical support to the Program Operations Division for calls forward, procurement tracking, booking, shipping, budget analysis and presentations.

	Objective 3: 	Assist FFP to expand its training portfolio through assessing training needs, developing standardized training packages, modifying and/or developing technical training modules, organizing and implementing training sessions related to Title II food aid program implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

	Objective 4: 	Provide information support in the areas of report writing and material updates, as well as modify (or develop) and implement a public relations, communication and outreach strategy for FFP.  

	Objective 5:	Provide data and operational support.
  
	Objective 6: 	Provide any necessary administrative/clerical and travel support to DCHA/FFP daily operations. 

	Objective 7:	Support the planning and organization for Title II specific events, such as the Food Aid Consultative Working Group, and follow-up actions as necessary. 


C.       CONTRACT TYPE

Five year firm fixed-price contract with option years 



Note:   The complete Solicitation No. M-OAA-DCHA-AP-06-1525 will be issued in two weeks with proposals due thirty days later.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR
THE USAID OFFICE OF FOOD FOR PEACE


A.	BACKGROUND

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), provides administrative, technical and financial oversight for the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) Title II program. Title II represents the largest amount of United States Government (USG) resources committed to global food insecurity, providing over $7 billion of assistance since 2001. FFP makes available Title II resources to private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IO), primarily the World Food Program (WFP), and foreign governments to address food insecurity resulting from short term emergencies and longer term development problems in food deficit countries. 

Title II programs operate in an environment characterized by increased frequency and severity of natural and manmade disasters; the heightened diplomatic, military and humanitarian demands on the U.S., including the war on terrorism; and the destabilizing potential of HIV/AIDS, conflict, and increased numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons. 

Under the new FFP Strategy Plan for 2006-2010 (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp), FFP has expanded its basic food security conceptual framework to make explicit the risks (economic, social, health and political risks as well as natural shocks) that impede progress toward improvements in food availability, access and utilization.  

Efforts to improve the measurement of Title II impact will continue under the new strategy.  This will include activities to assess the impact of the program on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) goal to reduce the prevalence of underweight children under five and improve the measures of food access and community coping capacity.  FFP will also put more emphasis on knowledge management under the new strategy, expanding its knowledge of what works and why and using this knowledge to influence policy and improve program impact in the field.  Under the new strategy, Title II programs will fall into one of two categories:  Single-Year Assistance Programs (SYAPs) or Multi-Year Assistance Programs (MYAPs) (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp).  

B.	OVERALL OBJECTIVES

The contractor will assist FFP to achieve its strategic objective through the realization of the following objectives: 

	Objective 1: 	Assist in the planning, management, technical and administration support of PL 480, Title II grants and cooperative agreements.

	Objective 2:  	Provide technical support to the Program Operations Division for calls forward, procurement tracking, booking, shipping, budget analysis and presentations.

	Objective 3: 	Assist FFP to expand its training portfolio through assessing training needs, developing standardized training packages, modifying and/or developing technical training modules, organizing and implementing training sessions related to Title II food aid program implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

	Objective 4: 	Provide information support in the areas of report writing and material updates, as well as modify (or develop) and implement a public relations, communication and outreach strategy for FFP.  

	Objective 5:	Provide data and operational support.
  
	Objective 6: 	Provide any necessary administrative/clerical and travel support to DCHA/FFP daily operations. 

	Objective 7:	Support the planning and organization for Title II specific events, such as the Food Aid Consultative Working Group, and follow-up actions as necessary. 


C.       CONTRACT TYPE

Five year firm fixed-price contract with option years 



Note:   The complete Solicitation No. M-OAA-DCHA-AP-06-1525 will be issued in two weeks with proposals due thirty days later.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), funds a comprehensive portfolio of grant and contract resources to discover and develop novel agents for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS-associated opportunistic pathogens, including tuberculosis.  Investigators at academic institutions and small biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies who identify new therapeutic or prevention agents frequently do not have the expertise or financial resources to conduct many of the additional studies needed to convert promising leads into pharmaceutical agents suitable for Phase I clinical evaluation.  To facilitate further development of promising leads, DAIDS supports a portfolio of in vitro, animal model, and drug development contracts to assist these investigators by providing the pharmaceutical-grade materials and preclinical data needed to support submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Several contracts in this research and development portfolio are being recompeted for award in fiscal year 2007, including:  (a) Tissue-based Small Animal Model for HIV Drug Discovery; (b) Pharmaceutical and Chemical Resources for AIDS Drug Development; (c) Safety Evaluation of Anti-AIDS Agents; and (d) Management of Information Resources for AIDS Drugs.  Through this Request for Proposals (RFP), DAIDS is recompeting contracts for the development and conduct of in vitro assays to assess the potential of drug substances for further development as anti-HIV agents.  

There are two separate parts to this project and separate capability statements are required for each part.  The two parts are described in more detail below.  Potential sources may respond either to Part A or Part B, or to both, but a separate stand alone capability statement must be submitted for either part.  Capability statements for Part A:   Confirmatory In Vitro Evaluations of HIV Therapeutics shall address all issues presented below pertaining to Part A only.  Similarly, capability statements for Part B:  Specialized In Vitro Virological Assays for HIV Therapeutics and Topical Microbicides shall address all issues presented below pertaining to Part B only.  Any submission which combines both Part A and Part B in the same capability statement will be returned to the potential source without review or further consideration.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development (USDA RD) anticipates awarding a three to five year, fixed rate, blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for accommodations to house temporarily relocated personnel from Washington, DC to the Raleigh, North Carolina area if a natural or man-made disaster prevents the performance of continued critical operating functions of the Agency.  The required services are as stated below.  THIS NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.   Applicable NAICS Codes:  721110 – Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels and 721120 – Casino Hotels.  The purpose of this notice is to determine the interest of Contractors, regardless of size status, in meeting the requirements and entering into an agreement/contract.  USDA RD requests that industry review the requirements and address any or all of the following questions, if interested in doing so:  In view of the requirements, is the BPA the right acquisition tool?  What other acquisition vehicles might the Agency consider?  Is a fixed rate type of agreement feasible with or without economic price adjustments?  Are the stated requirements sufficient?  That is, are there other industry standards and practices that should be considered or incorporated? Contractors having the capability of meeting the requirements are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information but no more than ten (10) pages in length, excluding responses/comments to the questions above, which demonstrates their ability to meet the requirements.  Full and complete responses are necessary to demonstrate to the Agency the Contractor’s capabilities in all aspects of the SOW.  Therefore, standard company brochures are not desired.

<CONTACT>Joan Glassman, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-588-3612, Fax 703-588-3713, Email joan.glassman@hq.dodea.edu
<DESC>Requirement: Web-based K-12 Assessment Delivery Platform

Background:  
The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to over 90,000 students.  DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas.  DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers seven states, Puerto Rico, and (for administrative purposes) Cuba.  DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into two areas: DoDDS-Europe and DoDDS-Pacific.  DoDDS-Europe consists of Portugal, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Turkey, Bahrain, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. DoDDS-Pacific includes Japan, Okinawa, Korea, and (for administrative purposes) Guam.  
The DoDEA Community Strategic Plan identified four goals to be reached by the year 2011.  Goal 1A focuses on student achievement in relation to DoDEA curriculum content standards. In order to ensure that DoDEA has a consistent set of assessment instruments by which to measure student achievement against the goals identified in the DoDEA Community Strategic Plan, several customized assessments have been developed for web-based administrations.  Current assessments include criterion-referenced assessments in Social Studies (grades 3 and 6), Science (grades 5 and 7), End-of-Course and quarterly assessments in Algebra I (middle school), and End-of-Course assessments U.S History and Biology both at the high school level. 

All aforementioned assessments have been field and pilot tested for psychometric validation using several different web-based platforms.  All include combinations of multiple-choice and constructed-response items.  

Need:

DoDEA is seeking to consolidate the administration and reporting of these assessments to a single test-delivery platform.  All assessment items and corresponding materials (graphics, passages, etc.) are in electronic format ready for deployment.  The first assessment to be administered will be the U.S. History End-of-Course assessment.  This assessment will be field-tested during Fall 2007.  Once complete, the remaining assessments including U.S. History will be operationally administered on the new web-based platform in Spring 2008.  As new assessments are developed it is anticipated that the test delivery platform vendor may be in contact with our test developers with DoDEA acting as an intermediary to transmit assessment items and data.

DoDEA is seeking comments from K-12 education commercial developers and vendors of web-based test delivery platforms.  The response should include the technical requirements and features of the corresponding platform. Desired platforms would include:
•	artificial intelligence;
•	distributed scoring up to three raters for constructed response items;
•	user-directed (customized) disaggregated reporting;
•	minimal configuration, installation, and maintenance;
•	ability to split test sessions by item type;
•	formative (quarterly) year-round testing;
•	test-security such that students cannot open any other application while testing;
•	User friendly features;
•	Ability to produce various levels of test results reports: student, classroom, school, district, area, system for all students and disaggregated by designated groups.

All questions regarding this Request for Information must be in written format via email and sent to joan.glassman@hq.dodea.edu and received by noon on 21 August.

<DESC>This sources sought notice is for small business concerns only.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain market research information from the small business community to assist the government in determining if there are two or more small business concerns, i.e., 8(a) business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business that is capable of providing the described services.  The government’s determination on how to compete the proposed requirement will be made based on responses to this notice and is at the sole discretion of the government.    

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 1212, Original Issue Discount Instruments, provides original issue discount (OID) information and tables to brokers, middlemen, and the public on an annual basis.  The tables are used by brokers, middlemen, and the public to calculate the amount of OID interest income to be reported on information returns and income tax returns for that calendar year.  

Contractor support services are used to produce the OID tables that are posted to the IRS website.  Contractor services are required to gather, analyze, and process bond information from various sources, including completed Forms 8281, Information Return for Publicly Offered Original Issue Discount Instruments.  The processed bond information results in 100 to 150 pages of tables.  Contractor services are also required to -- maintain and update the OID database using information from the IRS and Forms 8281; make OID calculations following detailed specifications; produce a minimum of eleven (11) tables using required formats; format output as required; and provide some written and telephone assistance to the general public regarding OID computation.  The NAICS Code is 518210; the size standard is $23 Million.  

All interested small businesses are invited to submit a capabilities statement of not more than 10 pages (not including past performance information).  The capability statement should be tailored to this notice and specifically address the company’s capabilities to provide the services outlined above; the company’s experience in projects that demonstrate the ability to accumulate, calculate, and produce OID or similar financial information; and demonstrate the ability to develop and manipulate financial-based databases from a variety of sources.  Additionally, the response must include past performance on Government contract(s) of similar scope, and the dates of any Government contract(s) held.  The cover letter submitted in response to this notice should include -- 1) company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, email address; 2) DUNS number and CAGE code; 3) the socioeconomic status of the company, i.e., small business concern, 8(a) business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and/or service-disabled veteran-owned small business; and 4) Small Business Certification, if any.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY EMAIL ONLY AND MUST BE RECEIVED BY 12:00 NOON (EASTERN STANDARD TIME), AUGUST 3, 2006.

Firms are advised that this notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract on the basis of this notice or responses thereto.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited, requested, or provided.  Responses to this notice will not serve as a proposal, bid, or offer, and will not be used by the Government to form a binding contract.  The sole purpose of this notice is to assess the capabilities and interests of small business concerns in performing these services so that a determination can be made on whether or not this requirement will be set-aside for small business.  Once that determination has been made, a presolicitation or solicitation notice will be posted.

Responses must be received no later than 12:00 Noon (Eastern Standard Time), August 9, 2006, by either post office mail or email only, to the following address:  Internal Revenue Service, Office of Procurement, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Constellation Centre, 5th Floor, Oxon Hill, MD 20745, Attn:  Patricia A.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, RDECOM-ARDEC is seeking small business sources for procurement  of a collapsible buttstock for the M240B Medium Machine Gun as designed by the  Government. This is purely a fabrication effort as all of the research and  development of the design has already been performed by the Government. The collapsible buttstock assembly replaces the standard buttstock of the M240  Machine Gun.  The collapsible buttstock contains the same hydraulic buffer as  the standard buttstock and is adjustable in length (to over three inches). The  buffer housing assembly is very similar to the standard buttstock but with a  few modifications. Users can reduce the length of the buttstock to make the  weapon more ergonomic especially when wearing body armor and in close quarter  combat situations. The item is envisioned to be mostly Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC)  machine fabricated.  It also requires molded plastic parts.  The materials to  be used in fabrication include but are not limited to: 304 and 631 series  Stainless Steel; 7068-T6511 Aluminum Alloy; 1137-1144 Carbon Steels; Spring  Steel; 4140 or 4340 Steel Alloy; A354,A355, A3576, A357, A380 or A384  Aluminum; and Dupont Plastic.  Various final surface protective finishes are  required for these materials.  The final assembly shall have a protective  finish lusterless black in color.  No deviations to the drawing materials,  treatment, or finish will be permitted.  The contractor shall fabricate the  item in accordance with U.S.G. drawings, inspect them in accordance with  U.S.G. Quality Assurance Provisions (QAP), and package them in accordance with  U.S.G. Special Packaging Instructions (SPI).  The contractor must be able to  sustain a delivery schedule of 250 â€“ 500 Collapsible Buttstock Assemblies per  month with a potential to increase production and delivery to 1200 Buttstocks  per month.  There will be a First Article Test quantity and requirement to  pass First Article prior to approval for full production. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Please include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of  contact, brochures/literature. This is only a Market Survey, not a pre-  solicitation notice. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a  solicitation notice will be published. All information should be sent to: U.S.  Army ARDEC, ATTN: David Drag, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army TACOM, Picatinny  Center for Contracting and Commerce, AMSTA-AQ-APD, Building 10, Picatinny, NJ  07806-5000.

<DESC>Purpose of Request for Information (RFI): This synopsis seeks the submission of Capabilities Statements from all Businesses which have the capability to meet the goals of the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Passenger and Personal Property System Branch, to continue vital software oper ations with replacement parts to extend deployed servers, integrate, and provide service that continues the existing hardware life of failed parts within the Transportation Standard Operational Personal Property System (TOPS) Servers currently deployed. The vendor will be required to have technical and functional knowledge of existing configuration, architecture, similar to that of transportation TOPS application in order to validate that all hardware components in no way negatively impact the installatio n or functionality of the system.  TOPS sites must continue urgent operations without downtime or loss of functionality.  The infrastructure and operational functions between systems to sustain HQ and Worldwide users are vital to the program and services. While this RFI focuses on server components, integrating those component areas that will be needed to support the vital TOPS Software to which it runs on, and provide maintenance for replacement or fixes as necessary over a one to three year period; SDDC r emains open to alternative ideas and considerations.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information or alternative methodologies.     Background: The TOPS System is a United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Joint Transportation Corporate Information Management (CIM) Center (JTCC)) designated, and Department of Defense (DOD) approved Defense Transportation System (DTS) Migration System.  TO PS is currently in a sunset phase of its lifecycle and is planned for replacement by Family First DPS.  TOPS is currently deployed at 160+ sites worldwide and is developed to run Intel X86 platforms, under the Solaris (UNIX) Operating System, and employs  the ORACLE Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) Software and Tools.  The system consists of approximately 300 SQL*FORMS developed using ORACLE FORMS 3.0 and ORACLE Version 7.1.4.  A hardware server upgrade was deployed in 2000 to over 200 sites worldwide.  The hardware has reached its useful life and request for information is being conducted to gather data to identify qualified quoters who are able to meet our requirements for a su rvival kit of known critical components (motherboard, power supply, etc) that would represent a standard hardware upgrade (from Pentium III) necessary to fully support the current operating system, and database configuration of the existing servers that ar e experiencing hard-to-replace parts. The interactive data components of the server parts must be available by the vendors (Quoters).  Must remain available at least for a three year period cycle, pass testing and sustain integration changes that would enable all parts to work within all softw are scripts and other vital component that currently support existing servers in both CONUS and OCONUS sites location areas.   These components to be further know as TOPS  Survival Kit provided by this RFI information will be used to establish data requi rements necessary to extend the existing TOPS equipment useful life.     Description of Information Requested: All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth herein are invited to submit a capability statement that details and demonstrates their ability to provide the required services/products. The capabilities statements are limite d to 20 pages. The Capability Statement should discuss the products capabilities as against the potential requirements, the products integration specifications (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance SDDC PPPSB  understanding of the information being submitted.  Also, vendors with a GSA schedule should provide the cont ract number of that schedule. All hardware component parts known as a TOPS survival kit must meet exact specifications and configuration that will be used to replace existing server components and be able to perform with that of existing software.  The survival kit components (mother board, power supply, etc) will also represent a standard hardware upgrade (from Pentium III) from the existing failed equipment currently deployed.   All hardware components being identified by the vendor must work without performance degradation in the TOPS environment with the TOPS Software and that the component equipment will be able to withstand any enhanced software release changes (such as space/ memory capability) being deployed worldwide. All hardware survival kit components must be readily available, be able to integrate with other components, carry at least a one year service and/or have an extended maintenance agreement from the date of being installed. The vendor must be able to address integration methods, track and deliver as defined in order for the components to perform against the TOPS software. Experience and knowledge to functional configuration, architecture, and application of a system in order to validate that all components that would in no way negatively impact the installation or functionality of the system.  The TOPS sites must be able to continue urgent operations without downtime or loss of functionality.  The vendor will require knowledge  of transportation infrastructure and operational functions between systems to sustain HQ and Worldwide users. The vendor/integrator must be able to travel to various sites, including oversees, etc. to install if necessary when required by the government.

<SUBJECT>--MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION
<DESC>MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that ma y be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41 facility types as described below.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COS Program.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Re gion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  The market research questionnaire will be available at the following web site: https://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil/ebs /Market_Research/MarketResearchSurveyForm.cfm?ProjectID=1.  This questionnaire will be open for input on August 4, 2006, through September 4, 2006.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will execute projects of all sizes.  Therefore, it is important for Industry  to respond to this market survey and demonstrate its experience relative to each of the facility types.  The results of the survey will help the Government determine Industrys experience and capability to execute the requirements.  As this is a nation-wi de survey, you will only need to complete this survey one time for your interest and capability to be included in our research.  As a result, the acquisition strategies will potentially include both set-aside projects and unrestricted projects.   The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect-engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction.  This Construction Program will consist of the following facility types: Physical Fitness Facility, Outdoor Sports Facility, Child Development Center  Infant/Toddlers, Child Development Center  School Age, Youth Activity Center, Consolidate d fire, Safety & Security Facility, Fire Station, Army Community Service Center, Bowling Center, Hazardous Material Storage Facility, Close Combat Tactical Trainer, Military Operations Urban Terrain Facility, Training Ranges, Battle Command Training Center , Training Support Center, Army Reserve Center,     Operational Readiness Training Complex (ORTC), General Instruction Building, Classroom, Enlisted Personnel Dinning Facility, Military Entrance Processing Station, Family Housing, Information Systems Facil ity, Criminal Investigation Facility, Religious Facility, Acces s Control Points, Aviation  Vertical Construction, 4-Star HQ Facility, National Guard Armory, Company Operations Facility, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility, Brigade Operations Complex, Brigade/Battalion HQ: Admin, Command and Control Army (UEy) & C orps (UEx) HQ: Admin/Ops, Deployment Facility, Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (Barracks), Basic Combat Training Complex (BCT) / One Station Unit Trainee (OSUT), Advanced Individual Training Complex (AIT), General Purpose Warehouse, Central Issue Warehouse, Hospitals, and Medical Facilities (health clinics, dental clinics, and medical clinics) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements.

Buyers and Sellers understand that a Buyer always maintains all rights assigned under their contracting authority and/or applicable acquisition regulations, and may select the most advantageous bid for the governments purpose while considering offline factors such as delivery, past performance, socio-economic classifications, and source rotation. ALL BOXES AND CONTAINERS MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED WITH THE REQUISITION REFERENCE NUMBER FOUND IN BLOCK 4, OF 347 ORDER FOR SUPPLIERS AND SERVICSE. SHIPPING DOCUMENTS WILL CELARLY LIST EACH ITEM AND THE QUANTITY SHIPPED AS CONTAINED WITHIN BOXES OR CONTAINERS. IF SINGLE LINE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED INTO MAJOR COMPONENT, SHIPPING DOCUMENTS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS SHIPPED WITHIN THE MAJOR COMPONENT. **TO HAVE A BID CONSIDERED FOR AWARD ALL VENDORS MUST PROVIDE MANUFACTURER, PART # AND EXTENDED SPECIFICATIONS OF THE EXACT MODEL BEING PROPOSED FOR ALL LINE ITEMS. NO EXEPTIONS. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION. REPOST EXPLAINATION:  Clarified that some line items are Brand Name or Equal, and others are Brand Name only.  Each Line item is marked appropriately. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION TRANSITION:  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION PANDUIT: This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure distribution requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories as key components of the Department’s network distribution system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing Panduit non-metallic raceway presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide.  The Installations Branch currently has Panduit non-metallic raceway in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation management. The Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing non-metallic network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name non-metallic raceway, fittings, or accessories would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand name non-metallic raceway components and subsequent replacement of entire distribution systems at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide to ensure compatibility.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations.

IF SINGLE LINE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED INTO MAJOR COMPONENT, SHIPPING DOCUMENTS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS SHIPPED WITHIN THE MAJOR COMPONENT. FOB DESTINATION CONUS BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Dell PowerEdge 1855 blade server was selected for this purpose because it must be used in a standardized Dell environment and because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The PowerEdge 1855 has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ out years support and maintenance agreements.    The PowerEdge 1855 blade servers offer space utilization and cost advantages over the 1 U servers they replace.  They will be deployed at a facility that is space constrained and thus the ability to deploy 10 blade servers in a chassis occupying only 7U of rack space is of special significance.   Unlike some other manufacturers’ blade servers, the 1855s offer the same functionality as can be obtained from 1 U servers, i.e., there is no trade-off between density and functionality. The Dell PowerEdge 1855 servers are to replace older equipment and must be delivered, installed, configured, tested and integrated in the production environment in time to go live prior to October 4, 2006, the initiation date of the 2008 Diversity Visa program. CA/CST therefore must take physical possession of this HW no later than September 1, 2006.   Even if another manufacturer’s server identical to the PowerEdge 1855 in terms of specifications, configuration and functionality were to become available at this juncture, it could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that it would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by October 4, 2006.   Absolutely no slippage can be allowed in the initiation date of the 2008 Diverstiy Visa program that the PowerEdge 1855 will support.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Security, past performance and price; with security being more important than past performance. The Government will award to the offeror submitting the best value proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation that will be issued and proposals are being requested. The solicitation number is HQMBR0602, and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).     This simplified acquisition is on a Time and Materials basis.    The North American Industry Classification Code is 514191 with a corresponding size standard of $18,000,000. Description of supply: The Corporation for National and Community Service, 1201 New York Ave., NW, Washington, DC, 20525, is seeking to enter into a contract with a vendor that can provide the requirement described below.  In mid-2002, the Senior Corps launched a web-based recruitment system called “Join Senior Service Now” (JASON) as a tool to attract, recruit, and match volunteers age 55 and over in Senior Corps programs and beyond. Additionally, the JASON system was designed as a promotional and management system for organizations interested in recruiting senior volunteers. This system is located at www.joinseniorservice.gov. 
The JASON system now contains volunteer opportunity records for more than 3,500 organizations seeking baby boomer and senior volunteers.  Organizations posting opportunities create and maintain organizational profiles that include descriptions of the assignments the volunteers will perform. The JASON system software supports online matching of potential volunteers to opportunities of interest. Since inception of the JASON system in 2002, the online recruitment arena has witnessed the arrival of non-government organizations with systems solutions, technical expertise, name recognition, branding, and reach to transform web-based tools from add-ons into primary recruitment vehicles for organizations and potential volunteers. For example, there is renewed emphasis and investment in ways to reach baby boomer volunteers through online recruitment – acknowledging that growing numbers of adults age 50 and over are internet savvy and have expectations about how it can serve as vehicle to streamline and simplify their lives.

Purpose of Project

The Senior Corps proposes to discontinue its 4-year-old JASON system as it currently exists in favor or a third-party commercial solution and subscription service that will:

•	Retire JASON as a standalone system, while retaining a presence for baby boomer and senior volunteerism to continue to grow boomer and senior service, and to repurpose the thousands of volunteer opportunity records currently available in JASON as a component of the broader universe of online opportunities for this demographic;

•	House and support the online recruitment records of Senior Corps’ more than 1,300 grantees and the more than 2,000 other organizations that now use JASON as a tool to recruit volunteers ages 55 and over;

•	Integrate the JASON records in the overall inventory of the web-based recruitment system administered by the successful contractor with branding and capacity to manage and track the presence of opportunities for senior volunteers and baby boomers;

•	Meet the requirement that all volunteer opportunity records, including the JASON records, provide a feed to the USA Freedom Corps search engine;

•	Deliver onboard capabilities to provide technical support and assistance to both organizational users and members of the public seeking to volunteer; and

•	Deliver onboard capabilities to provide reporting and metrics on key aspects of volunteering by boomers.


Overview of Tasks 

Task	                       Description
Task One	Integration of existing JASON system records     into the Contractor’s web-based recruitment system 
(Start Up Phase Only);

Task Two	Post-records integration: Support and management of JASON records in the Contractor’s web-based recruitment system as part of an overall inventory of opportunities supporting volunteering for people age 50 and over, with an emphasis on Baby Boomers 

(Start Up Phase and Ongoing Operations);

Task Three	Support USA Freedom Corps national search engine 

(Start Up Phase and Ongoing Operations);

The following FAR provision and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  
52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration
52.204-9 Personal Identity Verification 
52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items 
52.212-1 Addendum        Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items  
Paragraph (h) Multiple Awards – Delete entire paragraph and substitute 
“Award.  The Government plans to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation.”
52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS 

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
(b)	At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract that offers the best value to the Government without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore, contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(i)	Technical Capability
(ii)	Past Performance
(iii)	Price


Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.
	
(c)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT.  Factor (i) will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to the Submittal Requirements.  Offerors’ technical information will be used to determine whether the product proposed meets the specifications included in this solicitation.  Offerors’ technical information will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers that are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.

(d)	PAST PERFORMANCE.  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. 

The Offeror’s Past Performance will be evaluated as follows:

NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. 

OUTSTANDING: Very little to no potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. 

SATISFACTORY: Little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. 

MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. 

(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a  Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: 1.  Part number A06-003, Dice Subsystem Multiplexer System (1 Each). Last item. No other communications equipment is compatible for use with NASA's systems and requirements.  This equipment being procured will be used in conjunction with our voice switch, which is used by the LSP.  Since DICE has the same form and fit as TOPS, it is a direct replacement for the existing TOPS system.  Note, TOPS is 20 year old system that is no longer supportable, and it is urgently needed to be replaced.  Another vendor would require the Government to redesign our equipment lay out; this would be an excessive added cost to the government.	The Part number A06-003, Dice Subsystem Multiplexer System is uniquely matched with our design strategy of distributing assets as close to the user as possible.  This reduces long haul band width requirements, thus freeing up assets for other missions.  Also, it enhances our ability to trouble shoot the system.	 NASA KSC has performed extensive research into possible vendor sources for this application, and has determined that Quintron Systems Inc., Santa Maria, CA, is the only vendor that offers equipment which meets these requirements.  No supplier was found for a direct replacement.  While suppliers could be found for a separate “stand alone” purchase---as opposed to direct a replacement ---the prices would be substantially more expensive than the purchase of Part number A06-003, Dice Subsystem Multiplexer System.	 To that end, the Part number A06-003, Dice Subsystem Multiplexer System must be used in order to ensure compatibility with processes, procedures, and secure voice nets that are used during mission operations.  The acquisition of any other brand of Part number A06-003, Dice Subsystem Multiplexer System would therefore represent an unacceptable technical risk to KSC missions at VAFB, CA.    The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-11  This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334210, 1000 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to VAFB, CA is required within 30 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  Please indicate delivery date in your response.  The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9 Offers for the items(s) described above are due by July 26, 2006, 2:00 PM (EST) to NASA-KSC, Attn: Allen Miller, OP-LS, KSC, FL 32899 and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to VAFB, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

5. MARKET VALUE: FS 2, Step 1-7 ($74,148-$88,537)
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: October 2006-October 2007, extendable as required.
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Port-au-Prince, Haiti
8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 
The Port Au Prince Police Advisor (PA) will work collectively with INL Washington, the Narcotics Affairs Section in Embassy Port au Prince, the Haitian National Police (HNP), and the UN to develop, implement, and advise the HNP and the Ministry of Justice on matters related to the criminal justice and narcotics control system in Haiti, and to help coordinate U.S. foreign policy initiatives regarding the successful training, equipping and continued development of the HNP.  The PA frequently meets with members of the international community, including the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), UN Development Program, US military and law enforcement agencies, other donors, and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for the purpose of coordinating US programs with those ongoing in other organizations directed at Haitian law enforcement and counternarcotics development.  The PA is frequently required to attend emergency action committee and law enforcement working group meetings at the Embassy, work closely with the Embassy political section and other country team offices, and develop analyses and recommendations regarding law enforcement issues, assistance programs, and policies.

Background

INL currently implements a multi-million dollar assistance program with the Haitian National police and contributes 50 US police officers to the UN police component of MINUSTAH.

In addition, the Narcotics Affairs Section Officer (NAS) for Haiti is based in Santo-Domingo, Dominican Republic.  The NAS is based in Haiti for approximately 25% of the year, and requires the PA to be responsible for designing and budgeting for NAS programs 50% of the PA’s time.  The coordination of a complex program of this scope and importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires two full-time persons with significant police expertise to monitor and troubleshoot the day-to-day aspects of the police and administration of justice program.  One senior police advisor already exists and is currently serving in Haiti.  

Level of Effort
• 	The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week.

Position Elements
•	Provide expert police advice to the DG and IG of police regarding the establishment of a functioning, accountable police force.
•	Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of UNPOL deployment in Haiti, with special emphasis on U.S. UNPOL activities and the unique policy matters relating to U.S. CIVPOL. 
•	Assist with program development and recommendation of priorities for USG funding in Haiti.
•	Liaison with U.S and their contract program managers to ensure that acceptable MINUSTAH and U.S. standards of police assistance and performance are being met throughout the mission.
•	Coordinate, design, budget and implement US programs to assist sustainable law enforcement and counternarcotics development of the HNP, including the Coast Guard.
•	Enusure that INL programs meet US standards and that US-donated goods are well-used and accounted for.
•	Assist with contract oversight and verification of receipt of goods and services. 
•	Coordinate activities of U.S. police advisor assigned to the HNP Director General’s office. 
•	Ensure that a structure for vetting HNP officers working with the office of the HNP Director General is established.
•	Monitor and express professional opinions on the quality and scope of instruction being delivered to HNP recruits at the Police Academy and the HNP in general, and the type(s) and quantity of police equipment needed to facilitate the long-range sustainability of the HNP.  
•	Oversee U.S. bilateral projects focused on internal HNP capacity building and making recommendations to INL for any necessary changes.
•	Meet with members of the HNP to analyze internal perspectives and progress of the indigenous police organization.
•	Establishing a close working relationship with the Regional Security Officer (RSO), Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) officer, the Military Liaison Office and Consular Officers assigned to post for mutual exchange of information impacting the safety and security of U.S. law enforcement personnel serving in the mission. 
•	Arrange, coordinate, and report on visits for designated U.S. Officials related to the overall law enforcement mission.
•	Draft reports on the activities of the overall law enforcement effort and on substantive meetings related to the HNP.

•	Oral and written French communication skills.
•	Knowledge of police development in an international environment.
•	Familiarity with the Haitian environment.
•	Experience creating budgets and program plans.

Ability to:
•	Assist in the creation and implementation of policy objectives identified by INL;

GENERATION OF PUBLICATION 249, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation, Volume 1 dated March 9, 2006

1.0  Objective
The NGA Maritime Division (PVM) is obligated under Title 10 of the United States Code to provide accurate and up-to-date nautical charts, publications, and databases.  To do so, the Maritime Division is required to populate, maintain, and make available various products related to Marine Safety. The objective under this contract is to generate the next edition of Pub 249, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation Volume 1. It is imperative that the contractor fully understands the content and relationship of this database, where the data originated from and how it is used in the maritime arena.   Updates to this product are continuous and are made available to our customers worldwide. Access to this information is legally necessary for the mariner to safely keep charts and publications up-to-date. 

2.0  Scope
In order to complete the transition to providing all-digital publications, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency must continue to enhance the various publication datasets while deconflicting data as necessary.  Rather than simply supply the data in list form as is currently done with hard-copy publications, it is more advantageous for the mariner if this database is interlinked where possible and logical.  This will allow query access to data based on specific needs for safe navigation or mission planning.  The nature of the data requires a unique combination of a thorough nautical science background and extensive database experience in order to understand how the data is to be used and to validate formulas and solutions.

3.0  Performance Requirements
The Contractor shall perform all services required to satisfy the NGA requirements as listed in Section 3.2 and all additional tasks necessary to produce the modifications listed in this Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor shall use an all-digital production system, which shall facilitate in-process and product quality assurance checks for the government and/or its agents.  

3.1 Government Furnished Materials
NGA may provide the following sources or some subset thereof:

Provide access to the public files and databases necessary to complete the job.
Provide a Technical Representative knowledgeable about the databases in question and the functionalities to be developed.
Furnish hard or softcopy editions on request of each publication that is to be accessed.  

3.2 Production

The Contractor shall be required to perform all tasks necessary to generate Publication 249 as defined below from the supplied Government Furnished Materials (GFM).
Publication 249 (Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation)
Assemble programs and algorithms to generate Pub 249 for the 2010 epoch.
Coordinate with the British Admiralty on the Introduction including text language, tables, and examples.
Generate CD display of Main Table.
Provide training and software support for a three-week period upon completion.

3.3 Production Status Reports
The Contractor shall provide a monthly status update, Production Status Report, due the first day of each month.  Reports shall include detailed information regarding the work accomplished for each production phase.  These reports may be sent via email in a PC-compatible format or reported on the vendor’s web site.  If the report is made available via a web site, web site access shall be granted to the NGA COR.  Report information shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
Contract number, award date, report date
Production unit identifiers (assignment phase)
Projected completion date for each phase
Percent complete by process/phase.
Narrative of issues, problems, open-action items, etc…

4.0  Deliverables 
Deliverables will include the following: electronic files of the translated text in Microsoft Word (rich text format) on CD-Rom or DVD, and/or hard copy text printed on 81/2” X 11” white bond paper printed in 10 pt. Courier New font.  The Contractor shall maintain backup copies of all data sets for 180 days after they have received acceptance notice from the COR.  A copy of the Production Status Report needs to be provided to the Contracting Officer (KO) and the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  The government shall retain restricted rights to the procedures, patents, software tools, and other methods developed to meet this contract for exclusive and unlimited use by government personnel. The government shall not share software, tools, and procedures with other contractors or with any non-government organizations.

5.0  Quality Assurance 

5.1 Quality Assurance Checks
The government will review, test, and verify all deliverables for format and content. It will be deemed unacceptable if it manifestly does not perform as specified in this contract. All future upgrades and enhancements to the software shall be made available to NGA as soon as released for use by the contractor, and will be reviewed, tested, and verified by NGA before acceptance.
     
5.2 Onsite Quality Assistance Visits (QAV) 
The Government, or its agent, may perform both in-process and final random statistical sampling quality assurance checks.  In process random statistical sampling quality assurance checks may occur during a production phase, and will be coordinated and scheduled as a QAV with the Contractor.  Final random statistical sampling quality assurance checks may also take place at the end of a production phase.  QAV for the verification of conformance to the Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) is to ensure compliance with the data requirements and may be performed at the facility of the Contractor or Subcontractor and/or NGA, or its agent.  While at the Contractor facility, the Contractor shall make available to the government, or its agent, the necessary items and hardware/software to conduct the random statistical sampling.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary production personnel to operate the system and assist during the QAV. The QAV will usually be no longer than one day, although there may be situations that require additional time at the Contractor's facility.  QAV and/or random statistical sampling quality assurance checks do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for non-conforming work that is detected after delivery.  If non-conforming work is discovered at any time prior to and after delivery, it is the responsibility of the Contractor to make the necessary corrections without further compensation from the government.  NGA may require regular meetings and communication with the Contractor to discuss production and technical issues (i.e. VTC, teleconference, and e-mail).

5.3 Data Acceptance
All deliverables shall conform to requirements stipulated in the SOW and all attachments.  Acceptance criteria must be understood and agreed upon by both the government and the Contractor prior to task order award, and written acceptance will be provided to the Contractor by NGA for all deliverables.  This however, does not preclude future mutually agreed upon modifications to the task order.  Final reviews may be performed at the contractor’s site or at NGA. NGA reserves the right to waive the on-site review.  Upon completion of a final delivery review by NGA, an assessment will be made as to the correction method to be used for the deliverable, if required.

5.4 Discrepancy Reports 
If the deliverables are unacceptable, NGA will return all of the deliverables for corrections, along with a Discrepancy Report (DRs).  These reports contain all of the data non-conformances.  All materials shall be returned to NGA at the Contractor’s expense.  Corrections will be made until NGA review personnel deem the library to be acceptable.

5.5 Timelines for Corrections
All correction timelines will commence on the day the contractor receives all necessary materials and the NGA Discrepancy Report.  The following data-specific timelines for fixing and returning necessary corrections will be used in determining the score for the schedule scoring section in the GGI Performance database.

6.0  Security Requirements
All contractor-supplied information shall be UNCLASSIFIED. There will be no need for access to classified information.  

7.0  Delivery Schedule
NGA will provide the contractor with a proposed delivery date with the source package.  The contractor will then notify the COR via electronic mail within 3 calendar days as to whether the proposed delivery date is acceptable or requires further negotiation.  Failure to notify the COR within 3 calendar days will constitute contractor agreement with the proposed delivery date.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Data Acquisition System for Large Scale Structural Testing to be used in the Materials and Construction Research Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***
 
BACKGROUND

The Materials and Construction Research Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts large-scale tests of structural components in support of its internal research projects and for some external clients.  These tests are conducted using NIST’s 12 million lb Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and Tri-Directional Test Facility (TTF), as well as other smaller test machines.  Many of these tests require extensive instrumentation to measure strain, temperature, and displacement, as well as applied load.  

NIST’s current data acquisition system is now obsolete and it is no longer possible to obtain replacement components.  Thus, NIST is seeking to replace the existing data acquisition system to facilitate collection of data from large-scale tests.  

Statement of Work/Specifications:

The Offeror shall assemble a data acquisition system for use in acquiring data during large-scale structural tests from different sensor types, including but not limited to, strain gages, thermocouples, linear variable differential transducers (LVDT), load cells, and excitation displacement gages, and other sensors that produce +/- 10 V analog signals as outputs.  The data acquisition system shall meet or exceed the following requirements:

Number of Channels:  64 channels for strain gage data (including excitation voltage and signal conditioning); 32 channels for thermocouple data suitable for use with multiple thermocouple types; 16 channels for LVDT input, 16 analog input channels (0-10 V), 24 digital I/O channels, and 2 analog output channels.  The system shall include a 32-channel amplifier with a bandwidth of at least 10 kHz and include a signal conditioning module with gain and filters on each of the 32 channels.  

The system shall be mounted in a chassis that permits expansion of the system and shall be modular in nature so that modules can be updated or replaced as necessary.  The system shall also be capable of being mounted on a cart to facilitate movement of the system among different testing machines.

The Offeror shall also provide, all terminal block connections, cabling and other necessary equipment to assemble and connect all components of the system and provide connections for external sensors.

NO EXEPTIONS. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION. REPOST EXPLAINATION:  Clarified that some line items are Brand Name or Equal, and others are Brand Name only.  Each Line item is marked appropriately. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION TRANSITION:  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION PANDUIT: This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure distribution requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories as key components of the Department’s network distribution system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing Panduit non-metallic raceway presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide.  The Installations Branch currently has Panduit non-metallic raceway in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation management. The Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing non-metallic network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name non-metallic raceway, fittings, or accessories would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand name non-metallic raceway components and subsequent replacement of entire distribution systems at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide to ensure compatibility.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations.

A copy of the FBO combined synopsis/solicitation with Terms and Conditions, Offeror’s Representation and Certifications, and the wage determination was provided to attendees.

The following items were discussed:

Contract time is changed from 12 calendar days to 12 WORK DAYS.

We viewed the cone shed where cones will be delivered and inspected and bushels measured.  The contract can have a crew working at a couple of tables in the cone shed to clean cones.  We are looking for cones to be 90-95% clean.  We usually see about 90 cones per bushel.  If the cones are large, 80 cones per bushel.

Government will provide burlap bags.  No tagging is required.  If the contractor is paying individual collectors based on the quantity they collect, those quantities need to be monitored by the contractor.

Wheeled vehicles, and self propelled lifts can be used in the orchard.  There are no vehicle restrictions.

The Forest Service will remove irrigation pipes and mow the grass in the seed orchard prior to the start of work.

Contractor will be required to pick all trees clean, including old cones, bug infested cones, etc.  Unacceptable cones may be tossed to the ground and picked up later by the Contractor.  Payment for removal of the unacceptable cones and clean up of the orchard is incidental to the other work.  Woody debris, old cones, etc may be deposited in the burn pile.  Trash may be placed in the 6 CY dumpster located by the greenhouse complex.

Contractor will be charged for excessive damage to trees -- $50. per tree for broken limbs in the crown of the tree, and $100 per tree for scrapes that remove bark from the bole of the tree.

Contractor may encounter bee nests.  The Contractor may elect to not pick a tree if there is a large bee nest in it.  The COR may be able to remove/treat the nest in the evening or in the early morning, or the contractor can treat the nest.

The White Pine plantation was planted in 1971 or 1972.  There are approximately 1000 live trees to be picked.  Historically we’ve collected between 1000 and 2100 bushels per year from the orchard.  The trees were topped about 3 years ago.  Everything is reachable with a 40 foot lift.  Work has typically started around 8/10 annually.  The Government will conduct a ripeness test before issuing the Notice to Proceed to make sure the seed is mature.  Previously the Nursery did the work with 4 lift machines each having 1 operator and 2 pickers.  The COR thought 1 operator and 1 picker per machinewould work better.  Possible local sources for lift trucks are: H&E Equipment of Coeur d’Alene, ID; and Star Rental of Spokane, WA.

 

Work is allowed from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Collected cones shall not be dropped from the trees, but need to be lowered gently to the ground.  

Tree Improvement has 5 trees within the orchard that they will pick.  These trees will be flagged by the Government.

If  the Contractor elects to climb the trees, a rappel ring or similar set up is required in order to avoid damaging the trees.,.

<DESC>ELBERT P. TUTTLE BUILDING ANNEX
PRE-SUBMITTAL MEETING, July 19, 2006
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:  Can resumes be single spaced?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Usually when GSA outlines evaluation factors with percentages they do not request in addition the SF 330 – Part I and Part II.  What we need to know is do they want the evaluation responses as a separate component or do they want that information folded into the SF 330 – Part I:

   Evaluation Factor 1, Experience & Past Performance of the Team, SF 330, Section F 
   Evaluation Factor 2, Team Organization & Management Plan, SF 330, Section H
   Evaluation Factor 3, Key Personnel, SF 330, Section E 

A:  The SF 330 is a required submission.  It is left to the discretion of the firm submitting as to whether the information for the evaluation factors will be provided separately or folded into the SF 330.   

Q:  Clarify that the Small Business Subcontracting Plan and/or narrative description of outreach efforts to small businesses will not be due until the next step which is the Request for Proposal (RFP).

A:  If the firm submitting is a large business then a small business subcontracting plan is required at time of submission.  We realize this plan cannot be a firm plan at that time, but it allows the evaluators to determine how much and, in general, to whom consultant work will subcontracted to.  A final small business plan will be required prior to contract award. 

Q:  What are the systems to be commissioned?
-	HVAC, DHW, lighting?
-	Lighting plus electrical (UPS, generators)?
-	Envelope?
-	Fire/Life Safety?

A:  This is yet to be defined.

Q:  Please define the requirements for being considered a “small business.”

A:  This project has a NAICS Code of 541310, Architectural Services, for which the small business size standard is $4.5M gross average sales receipts for the past three years.  We apologize for the solicitation synopsis having an incorrect small business size standard.

Q:  Does having experience with “Ready Check” qualify as an alternative to “Dr. Checks”?

A:  Having a specific software product will not make one contractor more qualified than another.

Q:  Will the project be LEED Certified?  What Level?

A:  Yes.  At the Silver Level.

Q:  Will the CM be required to have experience using Revit?

A:  The CM must be familiar with these tools.  If the competency is not in-house, then it should be obtained through a consultant.   

Q:  Does the SF 330 requirements for the submission include Section E (Resumes) and Section F (Projects)?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is an SF 330 required just from the Prime, or from the consultants as well?  In other words, is this a combined SF 330?

A:  Prepare a separate Part II for each firm that will be part of the team proposed and submitted with Part I.

Q:  Is there a page limitation for the qualifications submission?

A:  As stated in the RFQ posted on FedBizOpps, the page limitations are:  Experience & Past Performance of Team, maximum of five pages per project; Team Organization & Management Plan, not to exceed five pages; Key Personnel, maximum of three pages for each.

Q:  Small Business Size Standard?  NAICS Code is 54130, Architectural Services, but RFP says small business is $28.5M.

A:  RFQ should have read $4.5M as the size standard.

Q:  Are you planning to include the relocation services?

A:  There is a statement in the RFQ that there may be post construction services consisting of move planning related services for the occupants of the building, but the decision has not yet been made if that will be included in this contract.  



Q:  Key Personnel 40% -- will subcontracting consultants receive the portion of the proposal to be responded to along with the names of the competing prime consultants?  This would allow us to forward necessary information to the primes that would be helpful towards getting the contract.

A:  If a firm wants to be a consultant, they need to co
