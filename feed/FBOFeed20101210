<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information.
The ESC/HGGI Depot Maintenance Program Management Office, Wright-Patterson AFB, is conducting market research to identify qualified businesses to provide sustainment/development Information Technology (IT) services support for the Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS) within the Depot Maintenance Systems Integration (DMSI) environment.
This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information containe! d in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.
The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to encourage competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  The NAICS Code for this IT services acquisition is 541511.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for NAICS code 541511, particularly if they are small business.  "Small business" means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.  Businesses, including their affiliates, whose gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three fiscal years DO NOT exceed $25 Million are considered a small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than "small business" in the next nine months, please indicate graduation date.  While one purpose of market research is to determ! ine small business capability and whether the requirement should be "set aside," it is also used to determine general industry capability and interest.  Large and Small Businesses under NAICS 541511 who are capable of performing the requirement are encouraged to respond.
Interested parties should submit a capabilities package, with a cover letter, that is brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrates ability to meet the stated requirements with sufficiently qualified personnel.  Provide qualification information (type and duration of employee experience relevant to the requirements) and the level of involvement (prime or sub-contractor) and time periods for work on similar projects.  The capabilities package should clearly present evidence that the interested party is fully capable of providing the required services and as such may contain any information that the interested party feels is relevant.
Questions concerning this requirement should be electronically sent to the Contract Specialist, Mary Piper, mary.piper@wpafb.af.mil, telephone number (937) 257-5008 and to the Contracting Officer, Michael Wills, michael.wills@wpafb.af.mil, telephone number (937) 257-4808.
Responses are due no later than 1200 hrs EST,  10 January  2010 and shall be electronically sent to both the Contract Specialist Mary Piper, mary.piper@wpafb.af.mil, telephone number (937) 257-5008, and to the Contracting Officer, Michael Wills, michael.wills@wpafb.af.mil. Late responses may not be reviewed.
An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman, concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at: ESC Ombudsman; Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB MA  01731; Telephone #:  781-377-5106; Facsimile #:  781-377-4659; E-Mail:  ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>The Remote Monitor and Logging System (RMLS) National Remote Maintenance and Monitoring (RMM) Network (NRN) located at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) program require Customized Cable Connector assembly hardware.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Statement of Work (SOW) attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a Capability Statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified in the SOW.
This is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price Contract with a period of performance of one year.
At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334417 Connectors, electronic (e.g., coaxial, cylindrical, printed circuit, rack and panel), manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees. 
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
PURPOSE:This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.  
In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
a.        Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the statement of work)b.        Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)c.

<DESC>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for a worldwide support services contract to support the Criminal Division's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT). Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, and materials necessary to perform the required functions consistent with applicable policies, regulations, procedures, business practices, and protocols that define the OPDAT operational environment. OPDAT works closely with other agencies of the United States Government including the National Security Council (NSC), the U.S. State Department (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to transform and develop foreign criminal justice systems in a variety of environments including those commonly described as: (1) Post conflict, such as was/is the case in El Salvador, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq; (2) Emerging democracies, such as Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan and South Africa; (3) Failed states, such as Liberia and Haiti; and (4) States in transition, such as Mexico, Nicaragua and Argentina. Currently, OPDAT provides justice sector development assistance in Africa and the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eurasia. Ongoing OPDAT projects in approximately seventy (70) countries directly support the following Department and Administration law enforcement priorities: (1) Develop the capacity of partner nations to combat terrorism and terrorist financing; (2) Assist partner countries to control their domestic violent crime problems, including organized crime, before they are exported to the United States; (3) Assist countries with inadequate laws to address international trafficking in humans; and (4) Provide development assistance to countries seeking to improve the effectiveness of their justice sector so they can cooperate more fully with the Department's law enforcement components. The bulk of the development/reform work performed by OPDAT can be separated into the following broad categories: (1) Development Assistance, including in-country creation of political will, constituencies, and creation of and/or reforming laws to bring about the legal basis for the essential functions of a country's criminal justice system; (2) Technical Assistance, including in-country guidance, planning, assistance in development of policy, procedure, and mentoring of foreign criminal justice managers/supervisors/prosecutors/ judges/lawyers, etc.; (3) Skills Development, which may be delivered in a variety of forms and be delivered in the classroom or on the job/in the field; (4) Equipment Donation, including that which is procured to enable host country criminal justice agencies to function properly and that which is surplus after the conclusion of an OPDAT program terminates; and (5) Construction, including both the design and building of new criminal justice facilities and the renovation of existing facilities to expand the capabilities of a host country criminal justice system to function efficiently and in a manner consistent with commonly accepted principles and human rights. The Government anticipates a base period of twelve months for the resultant contract and four additional option periods of twelve months each for a total period of performance of sixty (60) months. An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract is anticipated. The solicitation will be available on or about January 05, 2011. The due date for proposals will be approximately thirty-five (35) days after issuance of the solicitation. All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Services Administration's "Federal Business Opportunities" web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov . Hard copies of the solicitation itself will not be available. Interested parties should periodically check this web site for information regarding the schedule and this acquisition.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the size standard is $7.0 million. This acquisition is a fixed price type. The period of performance is one year from award date with two (2) one-year optional periods.<br /><br />The National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program is embarking on a longitudinal study of the effects of race and socioeconomic status on healthy aging in a representative sample of community-dwelling residents from the Baltimore metropolitan region. This study requires a detailed knowledge of the public health characteristics of this region and the ways in which racial and socioeconomic data must be collected to assess their influence on a variety of health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, psychophysiological and cognitive performance, and muscular strength and conditioning. Nutritional status influences an individual's risk for the development of chronic conditions, thereby affecting a person's ability to live a healthy and productive life. This project will define the criteria for determining the sample population's nutritional status and the effects of nutritional status over the course of the longitudinal study.<br /><br />The project looks to establish the planning documentation and epidemiological sample frame for conducting a longitudinal study that disentangles the confounding effects of race and socioeconomic status on long-term healthy aging. The goal of this project will focus on creating survey-sampling methodologies and applications unique to a diverse and complex population, spanning numerous and various socio-economic patterns, with a particular focus on assessment made by a longitudinal study. One unique study development goal to be established by this project is the development of criteria essential to assess nutritional status for segmenting a diverse population base. Nutrition monitoring methods to be used to develop this criterion include multiple dietary recalls, blood biochemistries, functional status measures, food security measures, and anthropometrical measures.<br /><br />The vendor will collect data from adult community dwelling volunteers; provide nutritional survey and scoring methodology for recording the nutritional constituents of participants' daily diets. The survey will be standardized so participants can be compared to one another and that participants can be compared to themselves over time. These data must be scored and entered using specifically designed nutritional look-up tables that are available then to score and enter into computer files. The vendor will assist the Institute in subsequent analyses.<br /><br />The University of Delaware has both the expertise and facilities for performing these analyses. Dr. Kuczmarski, a Professor of Nutrition of the Dept of Health, Nutrition, Exercise Sciences of University of Delaware, is widely regarded as an expert in the fields of minority nutrition, aging nutrition, nutritional monitoring and study design. She has the facilities and resources for analyzing these data and the expertise necessary for interpreting the results. Dr. Kuczmarski has been a senior co-investigator with the HANDLS program since 2003. She is a contributing member of the HANDLS working advisors group and the senior scientific advisory committee for the longitudinal study (HANDLS). She developed the nutritional protocols for this study and is a lead author on several manuscripts that have been published as a result of her continued contributions to the project. Dr. Kuczmarski's specific development of and expertise in the nutritional survey and scoring methodology could not be accomplished by another vendor. Her defined work with such diverse population groups as those considered by the HANDLS program make her eminently qualified for the performance of the proposed acquisition. Awarding the contract to another vendor would have detrimental impact on the on-going study.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider response submitted on or before 10:00 AM E.T., December 20, 2010 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Please reference announcement number 1881397 on all correspondence.<br />&nbsp;

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:
<p>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Montana requires the services of State licensed land surveyors for the performance of legal boundary surveys for Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and other conservation program easements throughout Montana. <br /><br />This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 (Architect-Engineering Services). The designated industry group (DIG) for this acquisition is NAICS code 541370 [Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services], which has a size standard of $4.5 million. This procurement is set-aside for Small Businesses.<br /><br />This office intends to award one or more indefinite-delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts as a result of this notice. The contract period includes one base year and four option years, for a maximum five years. Work requirements will be accomplished through individual task orders that will be specific in terms of location, acreage and time deadline. Task orders will be awarded as firm-fixed price procurements as sites requiring surveys are identified which may be as early as the date of contract award. Work under each Task Order will be subject to satisfactory price negotiation. The total number of task orders awarded will fluctuate based on need and availability of funds. The anticipated contract minimum is $50,000 and maximum is $1M.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</p>
<p>The surveyor must be a licensed land surveyor in the State of Montana. The Surveyor will provide a boundary survey of the easement area which meets the requirements of the attached specifications. Specifications may be revised during the performance of the contract to include revised survey specifications. All projects shall be completed within 45 calendar days after issuance of a task order (to include the required pre-survey site visit.<br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>Firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in no order of importance and are equally important.</p>
<p>1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.</p>
<p>The Surveyor must be a licensed land surveyor in the State of Montana. Evaluation will include the level of formal education, the number of years licensed, and involvement in professional activities/organizations.</p>
<p>2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required</p>
<p>Evaluation will be based on knowledge of local survey practices, records research, experience in conducting rural or conservation easement boundary surveys, and the approach used on previous surveys to solve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.</p>
<p>3. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required performance time.</p>
<p>Evaluation will be based on ability to accomplish multiple work orders to completion within performance time stipulated in the survey specifications and the ability to add personnel and/or consultants to complete work on time. Due to the nature of the easement programs, survey work tends to be seasonal and multiple task orders can be issued in a short period of time. The resultant solicitation and contract will stipulate limitations for the vendors' obligation to perform and the governments' obligation (maximum quantity) to order requirements for a given area. Vendors should especially focus on articulating how requirements up to the limit will be fulfilled in the required time, as well as plans for addressing quantities of surveys over the maximum limit. Evidence must be convincing and well articulated.</p>
<p>4. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry.</p>
<p>Evaluation will be based on the firm's past experience with other government agencies and the private sector in performing the requirements described in terms of cost control, quality, and timeliness of performance under previous contracts. Firms must provide a customer reference list with names, addresses, and telephone numbers for all projects listed as related experience.</p>
<p>5. Location in the general geographic area and knowledge of the locality of the project area</p>
<p>Evaluation will be based upon the firm's knowledge and experience in working in all geographic areas of Montana. Firms that work within specific areas of Montana shall provide a plan to provide state-wide service in a cost effective manner. Firms must clearly indicate the regional office locations or the sub-contracting plan to complete work in various areas of the state.</p>
<p>6. Demonstrated experience with similar types of projects in the State of Montana within the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>Evaluation will be based on the firm's experience in having conducted similar legal boundary surveys in the State of Montana within the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>Use Section H of Part I of the SF 330 to provide relevant information regarding the above six (6) factors, if not adequately addressed in another section of the SF 330.</p>
<p>Firms will be ranked from most to least qualified. A request for proposal will be requested from the most qualified firm for each planned award and negotiations will be conducted to arrive at a fair and reasonable fee rate schedule that will be used to price individual task orders. If a mutually acceptable price cannot be negotiated, negotiations will be terminated and the process will be repeated with the next highest ranked firm, and so on, and so forth, with the next if acceptable pricing cannot be negotiated.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov. It is also required that all contractors be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration in ORCA, contact the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov. This is NOT a Request for Proposals but a Request for Qualifications.</p>

<DESC>The V-22 Osprey aircraft has an Engine Air Particle Separator (EAPS) system forward of the engine in each nacelle. When operating there are two blower doors in each nacelle requiring actuators to open/close the doors to allow scavenged particles in the engine airflow to be directed overboard. The EAPS door actuators are currently a high failure component with unacceptable reliability and responsible for increased MMH/FH. They are the last unmitigated single point failure responsible for EAPS system inoperability that ultimately results in rapid engine performance degradation and reduced engine Time On Wing (TOW) when inoperable. Incorporation of reliability improvements will increase Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF). <br /><br />This planned effort will improve reliability by correcting the current known failure modes and to identify any additional failure modes or design discrepancies that can adversely impact reliability and EAPS system operability.
<p>This effort will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee.</p>

<a href="mailto:carmen.berrios@navy.mil">carmen.berrios@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City Division, Panama City, Florida (NSWC PCD) intends to execute a contract modification on contract N61331-07-C-0001 to the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) and their sub-contractor ODIM Spectrum Ltd (ODIM) in Canada to manufacture/produce a lighter version of the Organic Cable Reeling Assembly (ORCA). CCC / ODIM are the sole developer of the ORCA system since contract award on 18 Dec 2006. 

This requirement is unsuitable for competition for the following reasons: (1) ODIM has considerable expertise in the requirements and design of the reduced footprint ORCA (or ORCA size and weight reduction effort). They have completed nearly 65% of the effort required to develop the technical data package for the ORCA size and weight reduction effort.
 ODIM also is the only company that has considerable expertise in the construction of the original ORCA system (big ORCA). (2) Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through design and system interoperability considerations, it is reasonable to assert that ODIM Spectrum, Ltd., is the only source possessing the capabilities, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the initial production units. (3) This is a modification to the existing contract in order to support fabrication and testing of a reduced footprint (size and weight) of the ORCA systems within the meaning of FAR 6.302 1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of systems being acquired at this time, is not expected to be recovered through competition.
 The consequence of going to another contractor at this point in the program will be a significant increase in program cost and schedule. Conservatively, it will take another contract one year to reach the same level of proficiency as ODIM and develop the ORCA design to the same level of detail as the current ODIM design. This additional development time will translate into approximately $1M to $1.5M in additional development costs. 

ORCA is an integral part of a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Warfare Mission Package Operational Test currently scheduled for July 2011.  The anticipated contract modification issuance date is 3 January 2011.  NSWCPCD point of contact is Carmen M. Berrios, phone no: 850-234-4218, e-mail: carmen.berrios@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

VA has a backlog of FOIA requests that need to be appropriately resolved and contractor resources are needed to reduce that backlog to a manageable level and report to senior-level leadership.  In addition, contractor assistance is needed to mediate requests under FOIA as mandated in the O.P.E.N. Government Act as well as assisting in gathering records that are subject to a Motion for Discovery.  All services will be performed at VA Central Office located at 810 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington DC, 20420.  Using the source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 15.3), an award is contemplated to the responsible SDVOSB Offeror whose proposal is responsive to the solicitation requirements and is determined to be the best value to VA.  VA contemplates an award of a single firm fixed price contract with an ordering period of 12 months and an additional three 12 month option periods.  The solicitation will be made publicly available via the internet at https://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to regularly monitor https://www.fbo.gov for updates.  The government will not provide hard copies of the solicitation.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the website and downloading the solicitation, its attachments, and any amendments from the internet site identified above when issued.  All information regarding the procurement is provided herein, and no additional information shall be provided.  Therefore it is not necessary to contact VA until a solicitation has been released.  Correspondence from interested parties may result in a delay of solicitation release.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Information:<br /><br /></span></strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes issued by the C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The United States Air Force (USAF) is requesting information on Internal Cargo Lighting for the KC-135 R/T model aircraft.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE:<br /><br /></span></strong>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry for options of Internal Cargo Lighting for the USAF KC-135 R/T aircraft.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br /><br /></span></strong>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.<br /><br />The Government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. However, should proprietary information be submitted, it should be marked "PROPRIETARY", and will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:<br /><br /></span></strong>The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic missions. Cargo compartment lighting on this aircraft is inadequate for efficient use by crew members. Due to this inadequacy, a permanent, non-handheld light source capable of illumination by crew members is required to improve cargo compartment lighting. This lighting should enhance safety, cargo loading/unloading operations (floor/pallet), passenger carrying, and aero-medical mission operations. Zone lighting that eliminates or reduces the potential disturbance of other personnel is desired.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: <br /><br /></span></strong>The requirements listed below are viewed to be an integral part of any technical solution proposed in response to this RFI. All improvements, deviations, and modifications of these requirements should maintain the intent of the original requirement.<br /><br />1. The lighting system will provide visible spectrum light of adequate intensity capable of illuminating the cargo area.<br /><br />2. The system should require as little modification to the main aircraft structure as necessary. Any permanent solution could entail modification to the aircraft in the event of time savings during operational setup. Any permanent modification will require adequate substantiation and analysis.<br /><br />3. Some testing required IAW MIL-STD-810 or DO-160. Specific areas of concern include explosive atmosphere, vibration, temperature and shock.<br /><br />4. Based on previous light solution implementations, Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology is the preferred light solution. Fiber optic, incandescent, and fluorescent lighting have undesirable traits which lend these lighting types to be of secondary consideration.<br /><br />5. Lighting color should be white with no tint or tinge of other color. It may be advantageous to include other modes of color; however the primary mode must be pure white.<br /><br />6. Light should be of adequate intensity to perform all mission operations. One commercially referenced specification is OSHA Standard 29CFR1926.56(a), which requires a light intensity of 30 foot-candles ambient lighting in an office environment. In absence of a specification for KC-135 operations, the OSHA specification is a desirable objective, however, it is not an absolute requirement. Additional light intensity is usually a benefit, but additional costs of the system may offset the benefits achieved and a lower intensity system may be more desirable if it meets the operational lighting requirements of the user and is of lesser cost.. Any quantification or qualification of lighting will include projected foot candle measurements. The measurements should be taken at mid-fuselage, five feet off the cargo floor. An additional measurement should be taken mid-fuselage at floor level. <br /><br />7. Lighting should be focused on cargo or pallet interior. Use of reflectors and diffusers should be documented as well as the impact on intensity. Please describe any controllable movements of such reflectors or diffusers.<br /><br />8. Lighting solutions could be achieved by means of temporary installation, permanent lighting system solutions or a mixture thereof (hybrid). Specifically, the solutions can be categorized in one of three options as follows: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 1: Permanent lighting (NVG compatible)<br /></span></strong>Emergency power backup supplied by aircraft (2 28VDC - 35 AH batteries)<br />28vdc aircraft power <br />Primary: New aircraft power runs<br />Zone lighting control</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 2: Portable lighting carry on kit (NVG compatible)<br /></span></strong>Emergency power backup supplied by contractor<br />28vdc aircraft power <br />Primary: Utilize TCTO 1C-135-1806 outlets<br />Zone lighting control</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 3: Hybrid: Permanent and temporary considerations (NVG compatible)<br /></span></strong>Emergency power backup supplied by contractor or aircraft batteries<br />28vdc aircraft power<br />Primary: New aircraft power runs<br />Secondary: TCTO 1C-135-1806 outlets<br />ZoZone lighting control<br /><br />[Within all three (3) of these options, consideration should be given to ease of installation, cost and maintenance]<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note: All three (3) of the above solutions and/or lighting options should be addressed and incorporated within the RFI responses received.<br /><br /></span></strong>9. All system setup times should remain under 30 minutes. Option 2 will most likely require the most amount of time to setup. Any time savings variables, either in design or installation, should be maximized. Option 3 should focus on the time savings gained by having part of the system permanently installed.<br /><br />10. Power sources should be carefully considered. The TCTO 1C-135-1806 outlets provide a readily available power supply of 115VAC 400 Hz power. Consideration may be needed for conversion of power to 28VDC if necessary. <br /><br />11. Battery backup is an option, but not a requirement. The battery backup will allow the lighting system to operate without aircraft power. This is a desirable characteristic, but not a requirement.<br /><br />12. Lighting equipment must not interfere with mission operations such as cargo loading passenger transportation and normal aerial operations.<br /><br />13. The current aero medical mission utilizes three patient support pallets. A zone lighting concept is preferred. At a minimum, this should involve one zone per pallet and one zone for the boom area for a total of four zones. The entire cargo area should be covered by this area, beginning with the galley/latrine area and ending at the boom area. <br /><br />14. Lighting controls should be easily accessed. Lighting controls should be placed in the galley area and at the forward edge of each patient support pallet. The master lighting control should be able to turn all lights on and off. The lighting controls at each pallet should be able to turn the lights on and off for the corresponding pallet zone. The master control box should be positioned at either end of the light run to lessen congestion in the galley/latrine/cockpit area.<br /><br />15. The light solution should provide a dimming feature. This should provide varying degrees of intensity from off to fully illuminated. Dimming may be provided in steps or continuous. Dimming control should be incorporated into lighting control at each pallet.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: <br /><br /></span></strong>The KC-135 cargo compartment operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, resistant to moisture, and approved for in-flight use. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: <br /><br /></span></strong>Primary power source should be aircraft power. The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power, single-phase 28VAC, and 28 VDC. Lighting solution should include provisions for operating on the ground with no external or generator power available. <br /><br />The KC-135 has two 28 VDC batteries. The dissipated power should be minimized to avoid complete battery discharge. <br /><br />Lighting controls should be easily accessed and operated. <br /><br />Lighting that is compatible with night vision goggles is not required but is desirable.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL APPROACH:<br /><br /></span></strong>Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed portable internal cargo lighting system. Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address all potential risks.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />BACKGROUND:</span></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />The four F108 engines on the C/KC-135 have been affected by bearing failures and engine imbalance. Both of these issues have a history of causing up to $3.4 million dollars in damage to the engine. The EVMS could provide early warning of a failing bearing or imbalance, and allow the flight crew to reduce power to that engine to prevent any catastrophic damage.</p>
<p>The bearing failures involve the #3 (NSN's 3110-01-147-4990, 3110-01-328-4577) and #4 (NSN 3110-01-250-7102) bearings. Fan blade imbalance had contributed to three known mishaps. Two of those mishaps resulted in extensive cracks in the turbine fame and one resulted in a gearbox housing crack which allowed for total oil loss on takeoff. Fan blades are under NSN 2840-01-196-6053. In all cases, none of the imbalances were detected by flight crews during preflight checks.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responses shall address:<br /></span>1. Developmental schedule and cost (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Install Schedule using three different contract field teams<br />3. A Kit and B Kit Cost break out <br />4. Estimated installation cost with installation hours (broken down by system)<br />5. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified<br />6. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) improvement of replacement components<br />7. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)<br />8. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation<br />9. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as electrical, hydraulic power system requirements, airworthiness certifications actions completed, current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, training, pro and cons etc.)<br />10. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)<br />11. Maximum aircraft modified per year</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interested firms should also include the following in their response:<br /></span>- Company Name and Address<br />- CAGE Code (if available)<br />- Point of Contact<br />- Size of Business (i.e. Large/Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business,&nbsp;8 (a) concern, Minority-Owned Business)<br />- U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity</p>

The FAA will not respond to telephonic questions or comments.
In addition to submitting written proposals and information, each vendor is required to install its DME for functional testing. The location for testing is the FAA Technical Center (FAATC), Building 196, Atlantic City, NJ. The contact for coordinating equipment installation for testing is Rick Astillero, DME Test Director, (609) 703-5379 (Cell) (609) 485-5822 (Office) or Joe Bilello at (609) 485-5484/5431.

The time of installation and specific location of the equipment within Building 196 will be determined via a Government lottery witnessed by  the participating vendors. Each vendor's system will have its own location isolated from the other systems. The vendor will have five days to install, check out, burn-in their system and provide a letter to the Test Director indicating the system is ready for test. At this point, the official FAA Functional Test Evaluation will commence. No vendor personnel will be allowed access to their system without specific authorization from the DME Test Director during the Functional Test Evaluation. The mutually accepted test procedures, based on the generic test procedures provided in the SIR as tailoredto the individual vendor's system will be utilized in evaluating each vendor's system. The vendor tailored test procedures must be delivered with the Technical Proposal Volume 1.
Thank you for interest in doing business with the FAA.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to develop aninnovative combined micro/nano x-ray computed tomography and mechanical test facility forstructural materials of interest to NASA.  In this facility, we would conduct x-raycomputed tomography examinations during interrupted mechanical tests of importantmaterials and structures at NASA.  Resolution in the 10 micron or less range is desired. State-of-the-art X-ray CT, with its capability to really see into opaque materials at thetens of microns scale and possibly below, can be used to examine how the materials failin three-dimensional fashion.  Materials of interest include ceramic matrix composites,polymer matrix composites, sandwich structures consisting of composite face sheets andvarious core materials (honeycomb, foam, etc.), and structural foam materials.	Importantmechanical properties include compression, tension, shear and torsion tests. Theinformation garnered from this system can be fed to life and property modelingspecialists for model verification and fine tuning.  We can also use the CT data to buildsolid and FE models so that modelers can use structures with real-life damage in themodeling efforts. Responses to this inquiry should provide a detailed description of thesystem proposed including: 1. Overall system description 2. Detailed Component level descriptions 3.Process/Strategy for performing micro/nano-CT at the interrupted test so that no membersof the mechanical testing facility interfere with the X-ray beam, 4.

<DESC>CG 47 Class Aluminum Superstructure Task Force
Request For Information (RFI) 

1.0	Overview

The superstructure on the CG 47 Class Cruiser is constructed of aluminum alloys to meet stability and other naval architectural limit restrictions imposed by the DD 963 based hull and machinery plant. The CG 47 Class has experienced superstructure cracking. The cracks can be divided into two general categories as being attributed to (1) stress concentrations/aluminum fatigue, and (2) material degradation (sensitization) of the aluminum alloys.

The CG 47 Class Aluminum Superstructure Task Force, created by the U.S. Navy to study various alternatives to best eliminate Superstructure Cracking issues on CG 47 Class ships, is being coordinated by the Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, SEA 05 and SEA 21.
  The Task Force is assessing cost, schedule, and risk implications for the two options described below (see section 3.0), including wholesale superstructure replacement and replacing sections of the superstructure during CNO availabilities.  

2.0	Requirement

This RFI will assist in programmatic decisions regarding options to address the urgent need for correcting cracking issues on twenty-two (22) in-service CG 47 Class Ships with minimal developmental and programmatic risk.  This RFI is issued by SEA 05/SEA 21 as a  means of market research, to obtain information regarding the assessment of technically viable options for addressing CG 47 Class superstructure cracking problems. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation or intent by SEA 05/SEA 21 to acquire any products and/or services.
 SEA 05/SEA 21 does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. The information submitted in response to this RFI will assist in programmatic decisions to address CG 47 Class superstructure cracking problems.

Request information on:

Comments on the approach described
Experience (pro/con) with aluminum welding
Experience with repair of sensitized aluminum
Experience (pro/con) with welding large aluminum inserts 
Modular aluminum fabrication and construction techniques
Advanced or innovative production techniques

Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate SEA 05/SEA 21 to pay, or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.
  SEA 05/SEA 21 understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is neither binding nor does it constitute a proposal.
Responses to this RFI shall be submitted to POC listed in Section 6.0 via electronic mail (email) only by January 14, 2011.  Responses received after this date may not be afforded a comprehensive review.  Responses shall include the name, email address and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

3.0	Background

The CG 47 Class Superstructure Crack Task Force was initiated to implement a ninety (90) day study to assess technically viable options for addressing CG 47 Class superstructure cracking problems.

<RESPDATE>011411
<CONTACT>Anthony W. Kaiser, Contract Specialist, Phone 5058465084, Email anthony.kaiser@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>Contracting Office Address:
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, SMC/PKTV - Space Development and Test Directorate, Kirtland AFB, NM.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Space Development and Test Directorate (SD) intends to exercise a one (1) year option on the Engineering, Development and Sustainment (EDS) 2006 Contract, FA8818-06-D-0024, to provide engineering, development, operations, maintenance, and logistics services to the Directorate. The contract will be completing its five year base period and includes five additional one year options.</p>
<p>In preparation for this action, SD is conducting market research to ensure the exercise of the option is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government's need, and may serve as the basis for future acquisition strategies related to the any follow-on effort. As such, SD is requesting information from industry related to company engineering and operations services that may support the Government's requirements in full or in part.</p>
<p>Interested qualified industry respondents should provide a white paper addressing the following:</p>
<p>a. A description of selected company engineering and operations services capabilities (Statement of Capabilities) that currently exist or are planned to exist in FY11/12 that may support the stated Government requirements.</p>
<p>b. A business case that presents business rationale supporting use of the proposed engineering and operations services capability. The business case should reflect your understanding of current SD development and sustainment operations and the potential Return on Investment (ROI) for SD development and sustainment operations.</p>
<p>c. A description of how the vendor would support SD to:<br />o Act as the focal point and center of expertise for Department of Defense (DoD) experimental and demonstration space and missile operations.<br />o Operate experimental and demonstration satellites and missiles.<br />o Support space and missile research and development <br />o Support space and missile Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E)</p>
<p>d. A description of unique capabilities and/or experience your company has with engineering and operations services for space and missile systems development, operations and sustainment.</p>
<p>e. Hourly bid rates for some labor categories or cost data your company has with engineering and operations services for space and missile systems development, operations and sustainment. Include examples of any FPRAs with DCMA for similar engineering and operations services.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The SD mission is to:<br />a. Develop, test, and evaluate National Security Space systems;<br />b. Execute advanced space development and demonstration projects;<br />c. Develop and launch small launch vehicles and missile defense targets; and<br />d. Rapidly transition capabilities to the warfighter.</p>
<p>SD exercises a teaming approach to mission accomplishment. Contractors are full participants in this teaming arrangement with the SD program office, customers, associate contractors, and vendors. As a result, support is required at Kirtland AFB in NM, Schriever AFB in CO, and at deployed locations worldwide. The EDS contract supports one of the Directorate's Divisions, the Space Test and Operations Division.</p>
<p>The Space Test and Operations Division (STD) provides unique, world-class capabilities to integrate, launch, and test space systems. They support three types of space-based missions: one-of-a-kind; research and development; and responsive. Our support includes cradle-to-grave program execution from mission design to launch, early orbit, and on-orbit operations. STD leads three branches: Space Operations Branch, Space Test Branch, and the Responsive Satellite Command and Control Branch. The Space Operations Branch operates small satellites for R&amp;D customers, including program mission control, technology demonstration, and evaluation of transformational space operations concepts. The Space Test Branch utilizes a blend of military, government civilian, and contractor personnel to provide responsive support and needs-based space T&amp;E using a flexible management process from planning to execution. Space Test Branch's core competencies are satellite telemetry/communications support and space DT&amp;E. Using highly mobile ground systems or specially designed maritime platforms, the Mobile Range Team provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding from locations worldwide. The Satellite Systems Test Team conducts and supports space system test programs through active management, engineering, and test operations. The Responsive Satellite Command and Control Branch develops, integrates, tests, fields, and maintains telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C) systems, data processing and distribution systems, and operations support equipment for experimental and prototype spacecraft and other unique spacecraft as assigned.</p>
<p>Instructions for Submission:</p>
<p>SD requests interested, qualified sources to respond to this RFI. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>
<p>SD will use the information gathered in the RFI to develop potential acquisition strategies. The acquisition strategy may break out some or all of the engineering and operations services to specific SD mission areas. As such, responses from small businesses and small disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged, as are responses from those businesses who may only be able to satisfy a portion of the Government's stated need. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and/or economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firm, historically black college, and/or minority institution. The size standard for NAICS 541712 is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>Respondents should provide a non-proprietary response to this RFI if possible. If proprietary material is deemed essential, all proprietary information should be clearly marked and associated restrictions on Government use identified. Need to identify if you will utilize services of any foreign companies.</p>
<p>SD requests respondents deliver one (1) electronic soft copy no later than 14 January 2011. Submissions and any communication associated with this RFI shall be directed to the Government Contracting Officer via email and copy the other addressees below.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONfor SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)

Date:  12/10/2010 	                                                          PR Number: R9512110023	
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):  OLYM (Olympic National Park) is requesting award of a non-competitive one-year purchase order to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) for operational and emergency maintenance on OLYM Route 11 (US 101).  OLYM Route 11 is a 12.2 mile segment of US Highway 101 owned by and located within the boundary of Olympic Nation Park. OLYM has identified WSDOT as the sole practicable source for completion of operational and emergency maintenance on this portion of US 101.  NPS is not able to complete all of the work that is required to maintain this stretch of road, and relies on the WSDOT to provide any of the following tasks:   repair pavement cracks and holes, restriping, ditch cleaning, sign repair or replacement, vegetation control, litter pickup, snow removal, sanding, and tasks associated with bridges, guardrails, and related structures, slide removal, repair of erosion damage, unplanned road closures, and removal of fallen trees.  Olympic National Park's cost is $25,000 for fiscal year 2011.  
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):
     X     Only one responsible source (U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements").
______ Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. 
______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Explain:  In accordance with FAR 6.302(b), OLYM concluded that minimum needs can only be met by the WSDOT.  No other entity (private or public) could perform the work requested for the annual amount paid.  Equivalent work performed under a competitive construction contract is estimated at $250,000 to $500,000 for a one-year period based on the capability of the WSDOT to respond on an on-call basis and immediate mobilization due to the nature of their operation and location of their facilities.  The WSDOT is geared to rapid mobilization and equipment is often staged at NPS facilities such as the Elwha, or located at a non-NPS location within a few miles of the NPS-owned section of Highway 101 where no other entity would have access for staging.  As the performer of maintenance on 350 miles of US101 on the Olympic Peninsula for the State of Washington and a mission "to keep people and business moving by operating and improving the state's transportation systems vital to our taxpayers and communities", WSDOT has a vested interest in the maintenance of OLYM Route 12, as well as the existing facilities, staff and expertise to perform that maintenance. Additionally, WSDOT is always the first on scene during snowfall and storm events because it is their job to ensure public safety and maintain the route of travel on US101. It is the responsibility of National Park Service to provide the public the best available means for safe passage through Olympic National Park. It would not be practicable for any other entity to provide the level of service that WSDOT can provide.
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: WSDOT will perform a certain level of maintenance on OLYM Rt. 12 (US 101) regardless of whether or not the park provides funding, because it is a state highway and must remain open for the good of the public. OLYM is confident that there are no other private or public sources that will provide maintenance work at a nominal fee. OLYM management and the contracting branch feel that no significant degree of market research is justified.  A special notice was publicized at the Federal Business Opportunities website for a period of 10 calendar days.  All qualified offers are being considered on or before 12/27/2010.
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:a.  Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.b.  The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.
<p>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as identified in the Attachment. This initiative is referred to as the USSOCOM Joint Tactical C4ISR Information Transceiver System (JTCITS).</p>
<p>USSOCOM is in the process of formally categorizing attributes into various levels and priority of requirements including Key Performance Parameters (KPP). Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions require teams and individuals to be capable of operating alone in austere, hostile environments. This requires future SOF-unique equipment that is capable of multiple functions in order to obtain, gather, and share intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) situational awareness, and threat awareness information. Since SOF can only carry a limited amount of equipment, it is desired that each JTCITS transceiver provide as much capability as possible to include, as a minimum, radio frequency (RF) and tactical networking capability. The technology readiness level (TRL) of industry solutions for this integrated solution set should be at a minimum TRL 8.</p>
<p>The intent of the RFI is to identify companies that have the technical expertise, current production facilities, and integration and test capability to assemble, environmentally and technically test, and produce the systems in quantities of 50 or more per month. The JTCITS shall be assembled from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and/or Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) equipment and be ready for shipment to the Government within six months of an order.</p>
<p>Once industry information is received detailing potential technologically mature capabilities, USSOCOM may publish a draft RFP requesting further information and industry comments on a refined set of requirements along with a draft acquisition strategy and milestone schedule.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall respond, within 30 days after release of this RFI to the Contracting Officer, Deanna Cox, deanna.cox@socom.mil, and copy Ms. Amy Loveless, amy.loveless@socom.mil, with existing or near-term mature capabilities or products that meet all or a subset of the aforementioned attributes. Reponses that include information detailing potential tradeoffs or alternative solutions is encouraged. Also include your organization's cage code, point of contact information, &amp; business size with your response.</p>
<p>Program and technical point of contact is Mr. Mark Spadaro, 813-826-7263; email spadarom@socom.mil. Questions or requests for clarification may be sent directly to Mr. Spadaro, however, please ensure the Contracting Officer listed above is copied on all correspondence.</p>
<p>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP). An RFP may be posted on Fed Biz Ops at some future time. However, the Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>

<p>1752.224-70 Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)</p>
<p>(a) Applicability</p>
<p>This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.</p>
<p>(b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic.</p>
<p>(c) Responsibilities for Handling PII</p>
<p>(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor.</p>
<p>(2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location. All contract employees must be:<br />&#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.<br />&#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.<br />&#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.<br />&#61607; Email cannot be encrypted. Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment. Do not send PII in the content of an email.</p>
<p>(d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p>
<p>(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment. OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip. Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments. It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agency's network.</p>
<p>(2) A password protected file is not secure. Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.</p>
<p>(e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII</p>
<p>(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic. As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information. In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure.</p>
<p>(2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk - regardless of the time or day of the week. Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM's IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.<br /><br />(f) Points of Contact</p>

<DESC><p>The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data, including unique high quality data on the safety, effectiveness and performance of drugs, biologics and devices, both pre- and post-approval. These data are not collected or stored in standardized format and for this reason, cannot be evaluated across multiple studies, products or populations except with great difficulty. The goal of this project is to collaboratively build and use the standards, infrastructure, scientific resources, tools and policies needed to receive process and analyze this clinical study data. The infrastructure and approaches developed because of this project will enable studies of comparative effectiveness and other complex research and evaluation using the agency's vast, but untapped, stores of patient safety and clinical efficacy data.</p>
<p>The availability of a data repository for storing, organizing, and extracting scientific data about regulated products in a common "language" or format to support regulatory decision making underpins the success of any broader initiatives to comparatively evaluate product performance. Such a data repository will be developed during this project.</p>
<p>At its full capacity, CTR will be a comprehensive clinical trial and population health data repository that facilitates access to and analysis of 21st century data sources (e.g., large quantity digital data that come from new imaging and "omics" technologies), and collation of that data with other sources of information on medical product effectiveness, safety, and quality. CTR will be interoperable with clinical data sources such as electronic health records and other data sources and will include protocols for secure and reliable data storage and access, as well as analytic tools for data analysis.</p>
<p>The scope of this project is to design and develop CTR and associated services to support the automated processing of datasets compliant with the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) from the time they are made available for loading from the FDA's electronic document room (EDR) through their validation and loading into the CTR database. Development of the CTR will include a database design to be developed by the Subcontractor, with such database providing significant analytical and visualization functions. Data marts and SDTM materialized views (SDTM v3.1.2 or later) will be created to facilitate the use of the data for analysis by the FDA reviewers. CTR will be populated with legacy data to operationalize the system for CER.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will identify all requirements for the database and model designs, with consideration for the architecture and infrastructure needed to support a full operational system. The operational system will be developed by working through multiple iterations to design, develop, and test the system, insuring the reference system can be validated when transferred to the FDA.</p>
<p>This project will address tasks needed to provide an operational environment that supports the review and analysis of clinical trials data for CER. This operational environment will include the extraction, validation, loading and management of clinical trial data in CDISC SDTM format into CTR.</p>
<p>Key objectives are identified in the soliciation package.</p>

I.  SCOPE OF WORK:
A.	This project will engage an Architect Engineering firm to provide Contract Drawings, Functional Layouts, Specifications, Construction Cost Estimates, Engineering Calculations, and subsequent Construction Period Services for the above referenced project.  The project specifically will involve:

1.	Construction of a 2 floor expansion of approximately 8,100 square feet in the existing Clinical Addition and the remodeling of another approximately 8,100 square feet to allow for the expansion of both the Cardiology and Radiology outpatient clinics at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center.  The project scope includes construction of new space on the existing ground floor roof to expand the 1st floor to the south (approximately 2,165 square feet) and expanding the 2nd floor out over the new 1st  floor and existing roof areas to the south (approximately 6,000 square feet).  After completion of the new construction, Cardiology will relocate some operations into the new space on the 1st floor.  The vacated Cardiology spaces will then be renovated to provide approximately 2,100 square feet of space to construct 2 new Cath Labs and associated support spaces.  On the 2nd floor, Radiology will move some operations south into the new space and then the vacated spaces will be remodeled to allow for the expansion of administrative and ancillary functions as well as construction of new CT rooms, new ultrasound rooms and a 2nd MRI room on the existing reinforced floor slabs originally built into this area.  The Scope of Work will also take into consideration:

a.	Detailed space planning based on VHA Space Planning Chapter 276, Radiology Service, VHA Space Planning Chapter 210, Cardiovascular Laboratories, any other related VHA Space Planning Chapters, and present and future patient workload projections to determine the most efficient layout for the new facility. 
b.	An analysis of the services to be provided in the facility including room and area adjacencies for both patients and staff to reduce travel distances.  This includes travel routes and distances to the Cardiology and Radiology services in other areas of the medical center, especially the new Radiation Oncology Addition.
c.	Interviews with stakeholders to determine other critical factors for the functional layout.
d.	The correction of several patient environment issues such as the lack of ADA compliant patient restrooms adjacent to procedure rooms, the lack of patient holding and dressing areas, the lack of clean and soiled utility spaces, and negative impacts on patient visual and auditory privacy due to overcrowding of patient care areas.
e.	An analysis of potential site infrastructure impacts and the location and size of utility systems, especially the present cooling systems in the Radiology area which have become overtaxed with the addition of more and more high-powered medical equipment.
f.	The project will require a temporary staging area for construction materials and crane placement adjacent to the high vehicle and pedestrian traffic areas along 13th Street.  It is anticipated that a protected pedestrian sidewalk and special safety barriers will be needed to protect passersby from the construction work.  The new construction areas will be located above a main entrance to the hospital, a pedestrian skywalk, employee shuttle bus stop and the patient emergency room driveway entrance.  All of these locations will be temporarily displaced or protected throughout the construction period which will impact the final construction cost significantly.
g.	The project will require significant phasing during the construction process.

2.	Contract Drawings, Specifications and Engineering calculations shall supply a complete design to the satisfaction of the VA.

3.	The A/E shall provide a detailed construction cost estimate based on the contract drawings and specifications.   The project will be designed to stay within the allocated construction budget.

<p>REJECTION OF PROPOSAL: Failure of interested parties to demonstrate compliance with the requirements above will be cause to reject the proposal without further discussions.</p>
<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: See Attachment 2, Evaluation Factors for Award. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.216-18 Ordering (OCT 1995)<br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<p>52.216-19 Order Limitations (OCT 1995)<br />(a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than one, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract.<br />(b) Maximum order. The Contractor is not obligated to honor-<br />(1) Any order for a single item in excess of fifty;<br />(2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of fifty; or<br />(3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within 365 days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.<br />(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.<br />(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 14 days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source. (End of clause)</p>

The quantities of supplies or services specified in<br />the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract.

Subject to any limitations in the Order Limitations clause or elsewhere in this contract, the Contractor shall furnish to the Government all supplies or services specified in the Schedule and called for by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause.

The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after 90 days after the end of the contract's current ordering period. (End of clause)</p>
<p>52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days prior to expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain GIS Units as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.phpIn addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC>Q1 - Is a teaming approach encouraged or is the gov't looking for a sole provider of the services?
A1 - THAT WILL BE DETERMINED PRIOR TO POSTING THE ANTICIPATED RFQ BASED ON THE RESPONSES THE GOVERNMENT RECEIVES FROM THIS RFI.  
Q2 - Is funding in place for an FY11 procurement?
A2 - FUNDING IS AVAILABLE BUT CONTIGENT UPON WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO PROCEED WITH THIS REQUIREMENT.  
Q3 - Will there be a site survey permitted?
A3 - YES, SEE QUESTION/ANSWER #11.
Q4 - When do you anticipate Questions & Answers being posted on FBO & GSA e-Buy?
A4 - ANTICIPATED RESPONSE DATE TO QUESTIONS RECEIVED IS 12/10/10.
Q5 - The need for HSPD-12 compliancy is understood, but it may be important to the vendors that respond to know what bit lengths DOI uses for credentials from the cards. 200 bits would be non-concatenated, but this is important to know as different agencies concatenate due to existingsystem limitations. In addition, how often will PACS system need to do a CRL check?
A5 - SEE SECTION 2.1.4.B OF THE RFI.  THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO USE THE HSPD-12 CARD WITH THIS SYSTEM AT PRESENT.  VENDORS WISHING TO PROPOSE A HOST SYSTEM AND MULTI-TECHNOLOGY READERS THAT CAN SUPPORT THIS CARD IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT USPP HID CARD SHOULD OBTAIN THE DESIRED INFORMATION FROM DOI SOURCES.  THERE IS NO CURRENT REQUIREMENT FOR THIS ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM TO DO A CRL CHECK.  CRL CHECKS AND OTHER SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED OVER THE DOI LAN ARE NOT CONTROLLED OR MANAGED BY USPP.
Q6 - Does the PACS system need to integrate with Active Directory/LDAP DB?
A6 - NO.
Q7 - How many credentials are expected in the system?
A7 - SEE SECTION 2.1.4 E.3 OF THE RFI.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 800 AUTHORIZED CARDHOLDERS CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE SIZED TO ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST 5,000 CARDHOLDERS.
Q8 - Is there any specific need to support elevator access control?
A8 - YES.  AT AOF THERE IS ONE ELEVATOR OPENING AT AN EXTERIOR GROUND FLOOR LOCATION.  THE EXTERIOR CALL BUTTON IS CONTROLLED BY A CARD READER AT ALL TIMES.  THE ELEVATOR WILL ACCEPT A CALL FROM THE BUTTON (THE BUTTON WILL ONLY FUNCTION) AFTER AN AUTHORIZED CARD IS USED AT THE ADJACENT READER.  THERE IS NO CONTROL OF INTERIOR HALL CALL OR CAR CALL BUTTONS.
Q9 - What other systems shall the PACS system interface with? 
A9 - SEE SECTION 2.1.3 OF THE RFI.  THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR DISPATCHERS TO ACCESS VIDEO IMAGES OF ANY SORT IN CONJUNCTION WITH AUTHORIZED CARDHOLDER ACCESS.  
THERE IS NO INTERFACE BETWEEN THE CYMPHANY SYSTEM AND EXISTING CCTV CAMERAS.  CAMERAS MAY BE USED BY PERSONNEL AT INTERNAL INTERCOM STATIONS (TELECOR CONSOLES) TO IDENTIFY VISITORS USING INTERCOMS AT VARIOUS PERIMETER ENTRY DOORS.
THE USPP PHYSICAL SECURITY OPERATION DOES NOT USE VIDEO CAMERAS FOR "SURVEILLANCE" BUT RATHER FOR SITUATIONAL ASSESSMENT.  THIS ASSESSMENT IS RELATED TO (1) IDENTIFYING VISITORS AT VARIOUS CARD ACCESS CONTROL/VISTOR ENTRY POINTS AND (2) ASSESSING VARIOUS ALARMS AND EVENTS REPORTED BY THE SIMS ALARM SYSTEM, WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY INTERFACED IN ANY WAY WITH THE CYMPHANY ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM.
FOR CLARIFICATION, USPP HAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED AN INTERFACE WITH EXISTING ANALOG CAMERAS AND THE SIMS ALARM SYSTEM USING DIGITAL ENCODERS AND A VIDEO SERVER TO DISPLAY VIDEO ASSOCIATED WITH INTRUSION ALARMS AND OTHER SIGNALS ON THE SIMS OPERATOR'S CONSOLE(S).  THE SYSTEM PROVIDES DISPATCHER/ OPERATOR AND OTHER AUTHORIZED USER ACCESS TO BOTH LIVE AND STORED VIDEO OVER IP FROM BOTH USPP AND PARK SERVICE (NPS) PROTECTED SITES.
Q10 - What standards (UL) are expected from the PACS system and operator system?
A10 - OTHER THAN APPLICABLE LIFE SAFETY STANDARDS, THERE ARE NO APPLICABLE UL STANDARDS EXPECTED FOR THIS SYSTEM.
Q11 - We would like to visit the USPPCC, USPP Physical Security Office, AOF, District II Substation and the NCRCC. Can the DOI/USPP accommodate this request prior to the RFI submittal date?  
A11 - NO PRE-RFI VISIT IS NECESSARY.  PRE-BID SITE VISITS WILL NOT ONLY BE ALLOWED BUT REQUIRED OF ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS. THESE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL FACILITIES.
Q12 - Will the USPP provide facility images, maps, and/or drawings of the facilities and their security and fire systems infrastructure? What format will be provided; AutoCAD, Visio, etc.?
A12 - WE WILL PROVIDE AVAILABLE HARDCOPY DRAWINGS AND MANUALS FOR ON-SITE REVIEW TO ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS, ON A SCHEDULED BASIS, SUBSEQUENT TO ISSUING THE RFQ.  
Q13 - Are other USPP District facilities included in either the base scope or options? Are any other facilities outside of the greater Washington DC area (excluding NCRCC) within the Optional Scope?
A13 - SEE SECTION 1.2.B OF THE RFI, OPTION 2 AND 1.3.A.  THE LONG-TERM PROGRAM OBJECTIVE IS TO INCORPORATE MONITORING AND DATA MANAGEMENT OF ALL USPP AND NPS ACCESS CONTROL, INTRUSION AND FIRE ALARM CONTROL PANELS INTO A SINGLE, CENTRAL HOST SYSTEM.  IN ADDITION TO ALL PARKS WITHIN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION, THERE ARE CURRENTLY FOUR PARKS IN OTHER REGIONS FOR WHICH MONITORING OF INTRUSION AND FIRE SYSTEMS IS PROVIDED BY USPP AND NCRCC.  
Q14 - What fire systems are operating today and what degree of integration does the USPP desire?
A14 - USPP MONITORS CONVENTIONAL FIRE ALARM CONTROL PANELS FROM A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, VIA THE SIMS ALARM SYSTEM.  AT PRESENT THERE IS NO MONITORING OF FIRE SYSTEMS VIA THE CYMPHANY ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM, BUT THERE IS AN ON-SITE ELECTRICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN FIRE ALARM PANELS AND DOOR LOCKS WHERE REQUIRED BY CODE, SUCH THAT LOCKS WILL UNLOCK WHEN A FIRE ALARM OCCURS.
Q15 - What additional systems integration is required for the USPPCC? Can the USPP provide greater detail on the radio systems integration requirements?
A15 - THERE IS NO INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT WITH ANY RADIO SYSTEM. THE SIMS ALARM SYSTEM APPLICATION IS INSTALLED ON A SEPARATE PC AT DISPATCH CONSOLES.  OTHER APPLICATIONS (EMAIL, MS OFFICE APPLICATIONS, AND CERTAIN LEGACY CCTV DVR APPLICATIONS FOR A FEW PROTECTED FACILITIES) RUN ON THIS PC AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ALARM APPLICATION.  ALARMS FROM ONE DISTANT PARK REPORT VIA EMAIL.  THE RADIO SYSTEM AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT APPLICATIONS RUN ON SEPARATE COMPUTERS AT EACH DISPATCHER CONSOLE.
Q16 - What criteria will the USPP use for determining if the central station will be government owned and operated, government owned and contractor operated or contractor owned-contractor operated? All of these options are viable.
A16 - A DETERMINATION WILL BE MADE BY THE USPP OF WHICH OPTION OFFERS THE GREATEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT.    
Q17 - What make/model CCTV system is current deployed at DOI/USPP?
A17 - HARDWARE CONSISTS OF MOSTLY PELCO EQUIPMENT.
Q18 - Does the Park Service have a requirement for mobile data terminals (MDT) and related software in security response vehicles?
A18 - NOT WITH RESPECT TO THIS REQUIREMENT.
Q19 - What is the source of any existing GIS data?  AutoCAD, ESRI, etc?
A19 - THERE IS NO SUCH DATA APPLICABLE TO THIS REQUIREMENT.
Q20 - Will ISACS be required to interface with other additional systems?
A20 - SEE SECTION 1.A AND B OF THE RFI.  THE INITIAL OBJECTIVE IS TO REPLACE THE CURRENT ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM AT AOF AND D-2 WITH A NEW SYSTEM THAT CAN BE MONITORED AT THE USPP CENTRAL STATION AND MANAGED BY THE USPP PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE.  THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE (SEE 1.3) IS TO USE THIS NEW SYSTEM TO MONITOR AND MANAGE ALL ACCESS CONTROL, FIRE AND INTRUSION SYSTEMS CURRENTLY CONNECTED TO AND OPERATED/MANAGED BY THE CYMPHANY AND SIMS SYSTEMS.
Q21 - Will the ISACS operators be responsible for dispatching security guards/officers to security system triggered events? If so how will that dispatch occur - via radios, pagers, PDA?
A21 - USPP DISPATCHERS (ISACS OPERATORS) DISPATCH USPP OFFICERS USING THE USPP RADIO SYSTEM.  NCRCC DISPATCHERS USE A SEPARATE RADIO SYSTEM TO DISPATCH LAW ENFORCEMENT RANGERS AT PARKS FOR WHICH NCRCC IS THE PRIMARY CENTRAL STATION.  THESE ARE PARKS GENERALLY OUTSIDE THE WASHINGTON BELTWAY, OUSTIDE THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS NORMALLY SERVED BY USPP.
Q22 - Does the park Service require a continuity of operations (COOP) facility?
A22 - NOT AS PART OF THIS REQUIREMENT.
Q23- With respect to alarm and dispatch functions, are they performed by separate individuals or can they be consolidated into one function?
A24 - THEY CAN BE COMBINED IN ONE FUNCTION, AS THEY USUALLY ARE AT NCRCC.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE VERY SIGNIFICANT LOAD OF RADIO TRAFFIC, LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND ALARM EVENTS AT USPPCC, THE ALARM MONITORING FUNCTION IS HANDLED SEPARATELY FROM THE DISPATCH FUNCTION, BY SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS.  THE ALARM MONITOR(S) COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH THE RADIO DISPATCHERS FOR ALARM REPSONSE.  ALL DISPATCHERS ARE TRAINED BOTH AS RADIO DISPATCHERS AND ALARM SYSTEM MONITORS.
Q25 - Who is the CCTV system provider and what is the model? How many cameras are in the system now, how many are planned? Are they analog or digital?
A25 - MOST OF THE EQUIPMENT IS BY PELCO.  A VARIETY OF ANALOG CAMERAS AND MODELS ARE CURRENTLY INSTALLED.  REPLACEMENT OR UPGRADE OF THE CURRENT CCTV SYSTEM IS NOT PART OF THIS REQUIREMENT.
Q26 - The RFI addresses replacement of the Host System and integration of field sensors (readers/IDS sensors) with a new system that provides integration via a common Graphic User Interface (GIU).  Since the Park Service has a dispatch role, does the USPP desire to create an integrated response capability by integrating this system with a computer aided dispatch (CAD) capability that provides a common operating picture (COP)?
A26 - THIS CAPABILITY WILL BE CONSIDERED AS THE GOVERNMENT IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING CURRENT AND MODERN MARKET SOLUTIONS FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.
Q27 -What is the manufacture of the existing intrusion and fire systems? (Reference Section 1.2 B)
A27 - AT AOF AND D-2, ONLY SIEMENS/INFOGRAPHICS ACCESS CONTROL UNITS (ACU) ARE INSTALLED.  AT OTHER USPP AND NPS FACILITIES, OLD INTRUSION PANELS INCLUDE LEGACY MOOSE (SENTROL) Z2000 PANELS, AND DSC PC4020 PANELS AND RELATED PERIPHERALS.  DSC PANELS AND PC4820 ACCESS CONTROLS MODULES ARE USED FOR ACCESS CONTROL AT OTHER USPP FACILITIES.  DMP, HONEYWELL AND GE PANELS ARE INSTALLED AT A FEW PROTECTED NPS FACILITES.  FIRE ALARM CONTROL PANELS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF SILENT KNIGHT, SIEMENS/PYROTRONICS, SIMPLEX, NOTIFIER, GAMEWELL, AND OTHER FIRE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS.  
Q28 - What is the make-up of the present CCTV system?  i.e. Manufacture, model and quantity of cameras and head end equipment?  (Reference Section 2.1.3)  
A28 - SEE ANSWERS A17 AND A25.
Q29 - Do CCTV cameras integrate to the intercom system?  
A29 - YES.
Q30 - Please provide the model number for the Telcor intercom desk set. What was the installation date? 
A30 - THE SYSTEM IS A TELECOR 11/XL. INSTALLATION TIME FRAME IS APPROXIMATELY 2002 - 2004.
Q31 - Please provide the part number of the HID access card used at the HID card reader.  (Reference Section 2.1.4 B)
A31 - PART # 1326LSSMV.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HID KEY FOBS ARE ALSO USED, PART # 1346LSSSN.  ASSA ABLOY CLIQ KEYS, PART # CLIQ-KD, ARE ALSO USED.  MORE THAN ONE FACILITY CODE IS USED.
Q32 - Please provide the part number of the HID card reader and product family. (Reference Section 2.1.4 B)
A32 -  HID PROPROX, MINIPROX AND PROX POINT READERS ARE USED.  THESE ARE STANDARD COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF ITEMS, USING THE 26 BIT WIEGAND FORMAT.
Q33 - What version of the SIMS application is in service? At what locations? (Reference Section 2.1.4 E 2nd paragraph)
A33 - SIMS II FOR WINDOWS, AT BOTH USPPCC AND NCRCC.  BOTH CENTRAL STATIONS HAVE THE APPLICATION INSTALLED ON A "SERVER" PC COMMUNICATING WITH CLIENTS AT THE DISPATCHER CONSOLES.  AT NCRCC THERE ARE TWO DISPATCH CONSOLES WITH THE APPLICATION INSTALLED; AT USPPCC, FOUR CONSOLES HAVE THE APPLICATION INSTALLED.  TYPICALLY, THE APPLICATION IS RUNNING ON ONLY ONE CONSOLE AT EACH SITE.  THERE IS NO CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE SIMS APPLICATIONS AT THE TWO CENTRAL STATIONS - THEY ARE  STAND-ALONE AND INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS BUT CONTAIN THE SAME CUSTOMER DATABASES AND MONITOR THE SAME PROTECTED FACILITIES.
Q34 - What IT resources will be made available for this security integration effort? Are there specific IT requirements for the USPP?
A34 - AT PRESENT THE CYMPHANY APPLICATION AND ACCESS CONTROL PANELS COMMUNICATE OVER THE DOI LAN.  THE SIMS APPLICATION AND CONSOLES COMMUNICATE OVER THE DOI LAN.  THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO COMMUNICATE OVER THIS LAN.  THERE IS A PREFERENCE TO MOVE THESE SYSTEMS OFF THE DOI LAN AND ONTO THEIR OWN PRIVATE NETWORK.  FOR A SEPARATE LAN, VENDORS SHOULD ASSUME THAT THEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW LAN CABLING AT AOF BETWEEN THEIR PROCESSORS AND THE HOST SYSTEM, ALL OF WHICH MAY BE CO-LOCATED.  AT D-2, THE 2 ACU PROCESSORS ARE LOCATED IN A SINGLE TELEPHONE CLOSET WITH NO ETHERNET CABLING TO THE CONTROLLED DOORS/READER INTERFACE MODULES.   USPP WILL PROVIDE A BROADBAND LINE AT D-2 SEPARATE FROM THE DOI LAN CONNECTION AS NECESSARY FOR A SEPARATE NETWORK.
Q35 - What version of software is the InfoGraphics that is currently in operation? Is it Topaz, Sapphire or Diamond 1 or 2?
A35 - THE SOFTWARE BEING USED IS A PROPRIETARY PRODUCT CALLED "CYMPHANY C.P." VERSION 8.12.57, WHICH IS AN EQUIVALENT TO THE GE/INFOGRAPHICS DIAMOND SERIES PRODUCT.
Q36 - What is currently being used for CCTV recording now?  How is CCTV recording occurring currently?
A36 - CCTV SYSTEMS AT AOF, D-2 AND OTHER SUBSTATIONS ARE CURRENTLY RECORDNG ON PELCO DVRs.  OTHER USPP SITES ARE USING DIGITAL ENCODERS AND AN IP VIDEO SERVER TO RECORD VIDEO OVER IP, AND THERE IS A PROJECT IN PROCESS TO MOVE ALL USPP SITES TO THE IP VIDEO SERVER.
Q37 - Can you advise the maximum attachment file size your email server will accept?
A37 - THE MAXIMUM ATTACHMENT FILE SIZE IS 10MB.
