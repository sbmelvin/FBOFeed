<p align="left">The Contracting Officer MAY utilize online Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the online auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the online auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offerors' identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and the final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient,accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s). The
subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the
item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC>I. Introduction
<p>The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board ("RRB") is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor benefits program for railroad employees and their families. The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974. Its benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System. The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry. The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees. The RRB's headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p>The RRB does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to pay for the information solicited. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS OR BIDS. The RRB shall not transmit acknowledgements of receipt of potential offerors' submissions</p>
<p>II. Background</p>
<p>The RRB seeks a turnkey automated solution to work in conjunction with RRB's Microsoft SharePoint 2013 environment upgrade anticipated for the development, installation and maintenance of a centralized correspondence solution that scans, logs, routes, tracks and stores incoming and outgoing Agency correspondence from and to members of the public, private, and governmental sector.</p>
<p>III. Objective and Requirements</p>
<p>The RRB seeks information regarding centralized correspondence management solutions that are structured and integrated within a Microsoft SharePoint 2013 environment for approximately 300 end users. The solution should possess several important functionalities, including but not limited to those outlined below:<br />&bull; The application must be able to efficiently capture and track incoming and outgoing correspondence and associated communications electronically from initial receipt to final approval; <br />&bull; The application must allow users to route correspondence sequentially or simultaneously to the appropriate office or division with subject matter expertise for approval or edit as appropriate;<br />&bull; At any point during the process RRB staff should be able to determine the location of the response and the office/individual with possession/edit authority for the response;<br />&bull; The application must be able to capture, store, index, and archive incoming correspondence and associated documents to allow users to find and retrieve correspondence and associated history quickly; <br />&bull; The application should allow RRB system users to search for and retrieve correspondence by: (1) correspondent and/or constituent, (2) date received, (3) deadline to respond, (4) current location within or outside the RRB, (5) originating office, (6) approval date, (7) disapproval date, (8) issue and (9) subject;<br />&bull; The administrator of the application must be able to compartmentalize the information seen or accessed by the various users, so that access can be restricted to only offices/divisions and their staff with a need to view or edit responses at any particular stage of the process;<br />&bull; The application user interface must be intuitive to allow a user to launch the application, create a correspondence record, search and view the status of correspondence, update correspondence status, and approve and disapprove correspondence with minimum "hands-on" training;</p>
<p>&bull; The application must allow for access controls to designate individual users and/or groups to have privilege to perform specific actions on the correspondence;</p>
<p>&bull; The application must allow audit controls to be configured during workflow in order to preserve the security and integrity of finalized correspondence stored in the repository;</p>
<p>&bull; Upon initial receipt, the application shall provide RRB users with fields to record the name and address of the correspondent, the associated RRB office, the subject and issue identified, the date received and the recommended action; <br />&bull; The application should generate a unique identifier for each document entered into the system and any associated documents that would enable RRB users in the tracking correspondence actions related to the given piece of correspondence; <br />&bull; The application should provide RRB users and systems administrators or managers the ability to use/configure fields in application screens to standardize entry of information into the database;<br />&bull; RRB staff should be able to readily search the application on any fields with exact or partial keywords or dates with Boolean logic including searches of subject and issue fields as well any text or date fields; <br />&bull; The application should provide RRB staff with a report that shows the current status, background information (remarks/notes) and location of the pending or finalized RRB responses;<br />&bull; The application should provide RRB the ability to generate due dates and a production timeline by identifying the level, code, or priority of the response. The application should then be capable of producing Due Date alerts, including desirably emails notices;<br />&bull; The application should have the ability to download emails from RRB's Microsoft Exchange system to the correspondence database for processing;<br />&bull; The application should have the ability to integrate with and accept documents in formats including Microsoft Office and Adobe PDF's; <br />&bull; The application user interface must satisfy the legal/regulatory requirements identified by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which establishes requirements for access to information by persons with disabilities;</p>
<p>&bull; The application must provide RRB staff the capability to save scanned documents into the correspondence database or to connect to and read such documents as stored data on other sites of the RRB's data network; <br />&bull; The application should provide RRB staff with capability to produce automated reports; and<br />&bull; The application should have an archiving function</p>
<p><br />IV. Request for Information Submission Requirements</p>

<CONTACT>Linda C. Squires, Contracting Officer, Phone 2027813942, Email linda.squires@navy.mil
<DESC>This Special Notice is for the purpose of announcing an Industry Day event for the Surface Connector (X) Replacement (SC(X)R) Program.<br /><br />Program Executive Office, Ships (PMS 377) and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intend to conduct an Industry Day briefing on the future SC(X)R acquisition program as part of the Multi-Agency Craft Conference (MACC) hosted by American Society of Naval Engineers (ASNE) at the Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA on 10 June 2014. <br /><br />BACKGROUND: SC(X)R is a potential future program which will replace the Navy's Landing Craft, Utility (LCU) 1610 Class. <br /><br />The LCU 1610 Class today provides the Navy's amphibious ships with an organic capability to move heavier equipment and forces than aircraft or air-cushioned vessels between ship and shore in a reliable, fuel efficient manner. Their reliability, range and ability to operate independently make them the craft of choice for many specialized missions in lower threat environments. <br /><br />Although designed for a 25 year service life, the existing LCU have been operational for an average of 43 years. Many systems are obsolete and costly to maintain. As they reach the end of their extended operational service life, shortfalls will exist in amphibious ship-to-shore lifts that exacerbate the challenges of supporting delivery of troops, cargo and equipment on unimproved beaches or shallow ports. <br /><br />INDUSTRY DAY INFORMATION: This Industry Day briefing will provide Industry partners the opportunity to learn the current status of the future SC(X)R acquisition program, as well as tour one of the LCU craft from Assault Craft Unit Two (ACU 2) as part of the MACC 2014. This event will be of interest to service craft capable shipyards/boatyards, as well as supporting boat and service craft systems' venders. <br /><br />Registration information for the MACC 2014 conference may be found at https://www.navalengineers.org/events/individualeventwebsites/MACC2014/registration/Pages/ASNELandingPage.aspx <br /><br />Industry questions resulting from the briefing will be treated as public and all questions and answers will be made publicly available after the Industry Day event via FEDBIZOPPS website (www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of Industry, when providing any questions or comments (solicited or unsolicited), to properly mark information that is considered proprietary or is otherwise restricted. Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this Special Notice is strictly voluntary.
<p>NOTICES REGARDING SOLICITATION: This Special Notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this Special Notice. This is not a request for proposals, a promise to issue a request for proposals, or a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this Special Notice or any subsequent Special Notice.</p>
<p>Presentation of an Industry Day does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment, implied or otherwise, by the Government that a procurement action will be issued.</p>
<p>No telephone inquiries will be accepted and requests for solicitation packages will not be honored, as no solicitation is intended at this time.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result any attendance at the Industry Day. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. There is no funding associated with this announcement.<br />The issuance this Special Notice does not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition strategy. This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.</p>
