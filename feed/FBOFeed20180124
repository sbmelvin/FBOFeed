In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC><p>J&amp;A Statutory Authority:<br />FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) - Only One Responsible Source</p>
<p>Planned Contract Award Date:<br />26 March 2018</p>
<p>Planned Contract Award Number:<br />W91215-18-D-0001</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS:<br />The Army Contracting Command - Redstone (CCAM-RDI), Fort Eustis, VA, intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, firm fixed price and firm fixed price level of effort (IDIQ/FFP &amp; FFP/LOE) type contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source, to Geoweb3d, Inc., 45 Lewis Street, Binghamton, NY 13901-3028, CAGE Code 5C4T9, for the follow-on Design, Development and Integration of the "Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) eXecution Plan (XPlan) Next Generation Three-Dimension (3D) Mapping Engine" within the XPlan software suite and more specifically, within the Geographic engine of XPlan, which is called FalconView (FV).</p>
<p>REASON AUTHORITY CITED<br />Geoweb3d developed the only proven software 3D Engine to be embedded within the Execution Planning environment. Geoweb3d developed the 3D Engine at private expense and has no interest in selling the data rights to the software to the Government at this time and acquiring them would not be cost effective. The Government does not own sufficient rights to the data to allow open competition. There is no software that can satisfy the Government's need because it is the only proven 3D Engine to work within the XPlan environment. The personnel at Geoweb3d have all the technical expertise on the Geoweb3D software. In addition, award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The previous 3D Mapping Engine contract W91215-11-D-0005, was awarded to Geoweb3d on an other than full and open competitive basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source. There are no other known small disadvantaged businesses or large businesses that have the knowledge, expertise, or equipment to perform this work.</p>
<p>The Contracting Office posted a Request for Information (RFI) to www.fbo.gov on 23 May 2017 in order to determine the possibility of competing the follow-on 3D Mapping Engine development effort. The RFI received no responses. Based upon the Government's experience with the results of the RFI the selection of another vendor would likely duplicate cost that is not likely to be recouped through competition and generate an unacceptable risk of meeting schedules for delivery of software improvements and updates to Special Operations Forces that are still engaged in overseas contingency operations and other National Command Authority directed missions. Additionally, the use of an alternate development code base could cause incompatibility issues with the existing software code. In addition to the aforementioned costs, Geoweb3d has developed several proprietary software tools at its expense to facilitate both software development and maintenance. These proprietary tools assist in data validation, and are used to validate software deliverables prior to delivery. The Government does not currently own these tools, and an estimated $15,000,000 would be required for another source to develop replacements for these tools, along with potential schedule delays. Geoweb3d has previously stated it will not provide these tools to the Government or another third party developer and maintainer. Additionally, the Government may be required to pay annual licensing fees. The test tools are the GeoWeb 3D Engine and the GeoWeb 3D SDK.</p>
<p>In summary, the Government considered a competitive procurement, but based on the market research results, cost and schedule, this would not be in the Government's best interest. Geoweb3d's significant software development, testing and integration experience of the specific 3D Engine and XPlan models makes them the only source capable of supporting these efforts. The inevitability of competition injecting an estimated 16 - 22 month delay in acquiring software support services to develop enhancements and new modules, and to perform software maintenance on this legacy software product would place this program at a HIGH RISK without the probability of recouping the additional costs generated by using another source. Based on market research, it has been determined that an alternate vendor would not have the expertise to comprehend the software without a significant learning curve and access to Geoweb3d's proprietary software tools.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The above information is the Government's rationale for intending to negotiate with only one source, Geoweb3d. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. The capability statement must include a discussion on their capability to fulfill the requirement in accordance with the statement of work (Attachment 1. All capability statements should be submitted to the contracting office address. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail to the attention of Evelyn Ligon-Moton using the contract information provided in this synopsis. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS), intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to obtain HALO peptide ES-C18 Guard Columns 4.6x5mm, 2.7um, pkg/3 ITEM # 92124-102 to Mac-Mod Analytical, Inc. 103 Commons Court, Chadds Ford, PA 19317. <br /><br />The HALO&reg; peptide ES-C18 guard columns use Fused-Core&reg; particle technology to produce ultrahigh chromatographic resolution of target analytes and ultrafast separations without sacrificing analytical reliability. The HALO&reg; peptide ES-C18 guard columns are currently used on four Perfinity systems in their lipids project in the Clinical Chemistry Branch. These specific guard columns are needed for the Liquid Chromatographic separation of 37 different apolipoproteins in the size range of 600-6000 Daltons. This is accomplished simultaneously in all four Perfinity workstation systems currently in use for a clinical research study. The Perfinity workstations analyze samples continuously and on a daily basis. The HALO&reg; peptide ES-C18 guard columns have been used in their lipids method for the last two years. The guard columns outstanding past and current performance and reliability have allowed for the analysis of 120 samples per day, and the optimal separation of 37 different target analytes per sample. For all these reasons, these are the only columns they must continue using in their clinical studies to accomplish the project's objectives and to fulfill CDC's mission. The use of a different guard column will invalidate their analyses and it will completely halt the project since a new method validation will be required.
<p>The part requested from Mac-Mod Analytical is the only item suitable to their needs and Mac-Mode Analytical is the only distributor of HALO&reg; Peptide 2.7um, 160A, ES-C18, 4.6mm x 5mm guard columns within the United States. The HALO&reg; material is trademarked and manufactured only by Advanced Materials Technologies. The manufacturer has only one distributor within the United States.<br /><br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990, ALL OTHER PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC and TECHNICAL SERVICES, Size Standard $15,000,000.00.<br /><br /><br />No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the <br />Contracting Officer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The government will review capability statements submitted to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responses should be emailed to Mr. Philip Robinson at KKQ4@CDC.GOV using solicitation number 2018-Q-67853 in the subject line no later than 10:00 am Eastern Standard Time, February 8, 2018.</p>

Job Corps is a national residential and non-residential training and employment program, plus Outreach/Admissions and Career Transition Services that is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.

The contract will have a 2-year base period, including one month transition, September 1, 2018 through August 31, 2020, plus three (3) governmental unilateral renewal options of one (1) year each. The RFP will be available on or about February 8, 2018. It can be obtained from FedBizOps at https://www.fbo.gov.

that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<SOLNBR>SB1341-18-RQ-0176
<RESPDATE>020718
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with ATS Services Ltd.; Barkhausenweg 35 Auriga Drive, Unit 213, Ottawa, ON Canada K2E 8B7 for the purchase of a Microwave Radiometer for NIST's Remote Sensing Group (RSG) of the Sensor Science Division (SSD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The NIST SSD is working on a project to use an optical/infrared telescope system to make accurate spectral and radiometric measurements of the light from certain standard stars. This group is also working on a project to perform similar measurements on light from the moon. These NIST measurements will then serve as standard calibration spectra for multiple stakeholders who in turn operate other astronomical instruments and satellite instruments and that periodically view the standard stars and the moon. The measurements will be made from high altitude mountain observatories to maximize the amount of measurement time with clear night skies and to minimize the amount of water vapor along the optical path. This equipment acquisition is for a passive microwave atmospheric water vapor and temperature monitoring radiometer system (henceforth called a microwave radiometer) that can be user-located and user-relocated to a variety of different high altitude astronomical observatory locations, such as Cerro Paranal in Chile (2635 m altitude) or Mauna Loa in Hawaii (3394 m altitude), and be pointed by the user towards the stars or the moon.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition stated above is intended to be used alongside an astronomical telescope, and pointed at the same star (or moon) as the telescope, to monitor the atmospheric conditions along the optical path to the star (or moon) during nearly clear-sky, low-humidity, nighttime conditions. The system will usually be outside during operation. It will often also remain outside during periods of non-operation, and exposed to a much wider range of weather conditions than those encountered during its use for measurements, and it therefore must be able to survive, but not operate, when exposed to weather conditions that include events such as rain, fog, wind, and snow. The astronomical telescope itself is not part of this acquisition.</p>
<p>ATS Services Ltd. is the sole reseller for this product. The reason is microwave radiometers for atmospheric water vapor measurement usually operate at sea level for weather forecasting operations, and utilize the 25 GHz water vapor absorption line. For high altitude mountain-top (generally &gt;2000 meters above sea level) applications such as NIST's astronomical application, the remaining atmosphere is very dry, and the 25 GHz water vapor line does not provide an optimal signal. In this application, only a 183 GHz water vapor line provides a signal strong enough to meet the mission requirements. Market research methods including a sources sought notice posted on FBO indicated that Radiometer Physics GmbH (RPG) is the sole manufacturer of a product that meets this requirement and ATS Services Ltd. is sole North American reseller for this product.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Origin and shall be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515 and the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern on February 7, 2018. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<p><br />Anticipated Issue Date: 7 FEB 2018 - Closing Date: 7 MAR 2018 - 3:00 P.M. EST</p>

<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for AECMs for Initial Design Assessment, Effectiveness Flight Testing, Hazard, and Safety &amp; Qualification Testing resulting in improved capability in protecting military aircraft from Man Portable Air Defense Systems.</p>
<p>The Government intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for nine different types of AECMs: ASD1292 (XM219) Strapped Bundle, 36mm Strapped Bundle, MJU-66 in a 1x2 form factor, Cloud Decoy (36mm form factor; strapped bundle variant), Cloud Decoy (1x1 form factor; strapped bundle variant), Multi-Payload Decoy, Cloud Decoy (36mm form factor; full-up), Cloud Decoy (1x1 form factor; full-up), and BOL IR L5A2.

Job Order 0001 under the BOA is anticipated to provide BOL IR L5A2s. The basis for restricting competition is based on proprietary technical data, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source.

<p>Notice Type: <br />Presolicitation</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Alloy Surfaces Company (ASC), 121 N. Commerce Drive,<br />Chester Township, PA 19014. The scope of this effort is to purchase Airborne Expendable Countermeasures (AECMs). The AECMs are needed for evaluation, qualification, and effectiveness testing, as well as potential small quantities for Army, Air Force and Navy inventory. These AECM will be used for Initial Design Assessment, Effectiveness Flight Testing, Hazard, and Safety &amp; Qualification Testing resulting in improved capability in protecting military aircraft from Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS). The BOA also allows purchase of initial quantities for operational deployment. At least eight different types of countermeasures could be ordered from ASC on this BOA: ASD1292 (XM219) Strapped Bundle, 36mm Strapped Bundle, MJU-66 in a 1X2 form factor, Cloud Decoy (36mm form factor; strapped bundle variant), Cloud Decoy (1x1 form factor; strapped bundle variant), Multi-Payload Decoy, Cloud Decoy (36mm form factor; full-up), Cloud Decoy (1x1 form factor; full-up), and other flares as required. The period of the BOA is expected to be five years. Periodic review and synopsis of the BOA will be performed at this activity. Individual job orders will specify required tasks and all applicable delivery terms and conditions. The proposed BOA will be issued on or about 14 October 2016. All responsible sources may inquire into the specific terms and conditions included in the BOA; such inquiries will be considered by this agency. Contact Rene LeFever, via e-mail: rene.lefever1@navy.mil.</p>
<p>This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which states that full and open competition need not be provided for when the supplies required by the agency are available from only one responsible source. The basis for restricting competition is that ASC is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirements and no other type of supplies will satisfy agency requirements. It is likely that award to any other source would result in both unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The solicitation will be available on or about 25 August 2016 at FedBizOpps located at http://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor FedBizOpps for any additional amendments that may be issued. Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the <br />offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane. The POC is Rene LeFever, email: rene.lefever1@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice. For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for quality assurance services in support of its automated litigation support (ALS) contracts. Automated litigation support encompasses a wide range of professional services and products that help attorneys acquire, organize, develop, and present evidence throughout the course of litigation, from pre-filing investigation, through complaint, discovery, and trial, through post-trial briefs and the appeals process. DOJ has well-established ALS programs in place in the Civil Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Criminal Division, the Antitrust Division, the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Executive Office for U. S. Attorneys, and the Tax Division. Much of the work in these programs is performed by ALS contractors under ALS contracts awarded, administered, and monitored by DOJ. The primary purpose of this quality assurance contract will be to: (1) ensure that ALS Contractor deliverables are in compliance with ALS Contract specifications; and, (2) provide the basis for Government acceptance or rejection of ALS Contractor deliverables, in accordance with Contract specifications and requirements. Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, materials, and technologies necessary to provide a wide range of quality assurance services through the course of litigation. Key quality assurance objectives as they relate to litigation support include the following: 1) electronic file processing including images, native files, and loadable files; 2) database integrity, including Web-Based Databases (Completeness Check); 3) image capture, including digital image scanning; 4) document indexing/coding; 5) documentation (case manuals, procedures, and instructions; 6) training sessions; 7) specialized areas; and 8) litigation support processes and procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award one indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity type contract on an unrestricted basis. It is anticipated that the contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) option periods of one year each. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541199 with a size standard of $11.0 million. The solicitation will be available on or about February 8, 2018. Due date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance of the solicitation. All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Service Administration's "Federal Business Opportunities" web site, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation itself will not be available. Interested parties should periodically check this Internet site for information regarding the schedule and this acquisition.</p>

<RESPDATE>021518
<CONTACT>Lisa D. Walters, Phone 3016193451, Email lisa.d.walters13.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this <strong>pre-announcement</strong> for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on providing innovative solutions to critical problems in visual loss. <strong>The overarching goal of this program is to provide biomanufacturing or advanced development for an emerging area of medical technology and innovation that supports standard procedures toward a prototype aimed to re-establish or regenerate damaged visual pathways.</strong>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology Focus Areas</span></strong><br />Applications must address one or more of the following focus areas in nerve regeneration or end-organ health. Specifically, MTEC seeks prototype development and/or biomanufacturing of a device, biologic, or combination prototype that:</p>
<p>&bull; Enhances optic nerve regeneration<br />&bull; Re-establishes neuronal connections between retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus with high efficiency</p>
<p>The current effort aims to promote highly innovative, groundbreaking research; high-impact research with near-term clinical relevance; multidisciplinary, synergistic research; and translational studies to support the fluid transfer of knowledge from basic principles to clinical solutions. Purely <em>in vitro</em> efforts will not be considered. Proposed projects must be based on logical reasoning and sound scientific rationale that spread biomanufacturing and prototype development. Please note that awards are not to be exploratory in nature and require a foundation of preliminary data. Research involving animal or human subjects is allowed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential Funding Availability<br /></span></strong>Potential funding available for awards made from this Funding Opportunity is $6.0M. Potential funds will be made available by the U.S. Government, Glaucoma Research Foundation, and BrightFocus Foundation.</p>
<p>Funds are intended to support areas of regenerative medicine manufacturing and prototyping that require development and harmonization into reproducible, consistent procedures which could stand the test of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.</p>
<p>MTEC intends to make one or two awards at $3.0M each (direct and indirect costs) composed of teaming arrangements demonstrated to achieve the prototype development and manufacturing standardization.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance (POP) is not to exceed 36 months.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquisition Approach<br /></span></strong>This RPP will be conducted using a two-staged approach. In Stage 1, current MTEC members are invited to submit White Papers using the format contained in the RPP. The Government, Glaucoma Research Foundation, and BrightFocus Foundation will evaluate White Papers submitted and will select White Papers that best meet their current technology priorities using the criteria specified in the RPP. Offerors whose technology solution is selected for further consideration based on White Paper evaluation will be invited to submit a proposal in Stage 2. Notification letters will contain specific Stage 2 proposal submission requirements.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information<br /></span></strong>The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, "nontraditional" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), Glaucoma Research Foundation and BrightFocus Foundation will have access to white papers and proposals submitted through this RPP for the purposes of the evaluation and selection process.<br />The RPP will be posted to the MTEC website and FedBizOpps.gov to notify interested parties. MTEC membership is required for the submission of a white paper in response to this upcoming MTEC RPP. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/</p>

<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>In 2012, during a periodic audit, significant deterioration of asbestos-containing materials and lead-containing materials was identified on an Icebreaker, Buoy, and Construction Tender Barge. Subsequently, an investigation revealed class-wide exposure risks from asbestos-containing materials and lead-containing materials and the presence of systematic failures. As a result, the Safety and Environmental Health community established a strategy to sustain efforts in order to reinforce and maintain a high-level of awareness within the Inland Buoy River/Construction (IBCT) tender and barge fleet.</p>
<p>The US Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking professional industrial hygiene assistance to conduct asbestos and lead exposure assessments on the IBCT tender and barge fleet biennially, which includes 46 cutters comprised by the WLIC, WLI, WLR, and WYTL fleets.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct exposure assessments lasting a maximum of three days. This includes a mandatory minimum of eight hours of personal exposure monitoring during operations underway. The following objectives will be accomplished by contracted personnel during each assessment: (1) complete an administrative audit of the Unit Asbestos and Lead Hazard Management programs and plans; (2) review and reconciliation of unit asbestos and lead inventory with historical and current Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) abatement records and on-site condition assessments; (3) complete a condition assessment of all accessible asbestos-containing materials (ACM), presumed asbestos-containing materials (PACM) and lead-containing materials (LCM) (without removing interferences) and characterize the material condition. If ACM/PACM material is damaged, deteriorated or failing, the contractor will collect bulk samples of each material to determine presence or absence of asbestos in accordance with industry standards and regulations; (4) collect personal breathing zone air samples underway during normal operations; and (5) provide asbestos and lead hazardous awareness training for the cutter crew and on-the-job training for the designated unit Asbestos Program Manager.</p>
<p>2.0 PURPOSE OF THIS RFI</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to ascertain available sources to provide reliable and capable professional industrial hygiene services to conduct asbestos and lead exposure assessments on the Inland Buoy River Construction tender and barge fleet.</p>

Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;This is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.&nbsp; Any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis will not be paid by the Government.<br /><br />7.&nbsp;United States Air Force would be unable to supply data rights for this service.</p>

<RESPDATE>010318
<CONTACT>David L. Ariosto, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 8459388205, Email david.l.ariosto.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />W911SD-18-P-0029 <br />REFUSE AND RECYCLING AT WEST POINT<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a BRIDGE contract for REFUSE AND RECYCLING SERVICES on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to Donato Marangi Inc. is for refuse and recycling collection at the United States Army Garrison, West Point. This will be for a period of time up to 60 days from the date of award. This will only be issued if the current solicitation W911SD-17-R-0008 is not awarded in sufficient time to continue the refuse and recycling operations at West Point on 1 February 2018. A solicitation #W911SD-17-R-0008 for a Base Plus 4 Option Year period contract for refuse and recycling has been issued for this requirement and will close on 12 January 2018 and an award is expected to be made with an effective start date of 1 February 2018. If a resultant award will be issued from W911SD-17-R-0008 and it will be in effect on 1 February, then no further Sole Source Awards will be required.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is e.g., 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Attached are the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) and Technical Exhibits with workload data (for services).</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code(s) is/are: 562111 Solid Waste Collection, $38.5 Million size standard.</p>

The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; studying patients enrolled in formally approved research protocols conducted within the Clinical Center; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>As an organization, the NIH is a unique medical research entity. Management is intentionally decentralized across 27 Institutes and Centers, yet the individual organizations cooperate and collaborate in a useful and necessary partnership. This controlled decentralization is expected to continue as most feel it provides a fertile environment for individual research and supports the incredible scientific diversity represented at NIH.</p>
<p>The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, a 230-bed, federally funded, biomedical-research hospital, is located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States. Patients are admitted to the Clinical Center for the sole purpose of participating in clinical research protocols. Patients may be self referred or referred by their local physicians. The Clinical Center admits patients from all over the world for clinical trials and natural history studies, with all care provided free of charge. The Clinical Center accommodates about 7,000 inpatient admissions and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. The new Clinical Research Center (CRC) was completed in September 2004, which includes all new inpatient and day hospital units.</p>
<p>The Department of Hospital Epidemiology Services (HES) conducts active infection surveillance for all inpatient and outpatient units to identify and track health care associated infections, identify organisms with unusual sensitivity patterns, establish baseline infection rates and identify increases above the expected level. HES monitors all inpatients and outpatients, i.e., high risk intensive care patients; hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplants; outpatients with follow-up on culture; patients with active lines. At any given time, approximately 100 - 400 patients could be under surveillance.</p>
<p>TheraDoc is an application used in Hospital Epidemiology Services in the NIH CC. The primary component is the Infection Control Assistant, which provides real-time surveillance and alerts for infection analysis. Live data from various sources is sent to TheraDoc from CRIS Sunrise (Admission, Discharge, Transfer, and Patient Demographic information) to help trace infections across the hospital. Other interfaces include Radiology results, Lab results, and Pharmacy orders. TheraDoc consolidates all of this information in a single location for quick analysis on patients. Future enhancements include the implementation of new VAD, vital sign, and surgical interfaces, as well as new modules to support Pharmacy use, including an Adverse Drug Events Assistant, Clinical Alerts Assistant, and Antibiotic Assistant.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Census Bureau is developing software that implements mechanisms for performing privacy preserving statistical data analysis. This software will be used for the 2020 Census of Population and Households, the 2017 Economic Census, and other data products produced by the Census Bureau. In conjunction with this development effort, the Census Bureau is looking for companies who have experience in both software auditing and formal privacy to perform a detailed evaluation of the software. <br />Much of the software being developed by the Census Bureau will be released as open source software. Although the software is designed to work with confidential data protected by Title 13 and/or Title 26, the Census Bureau hopes to provide this software with test datasets that can be freely redistributed. It is expected that much of the Census Bureau's software will be written in the Python programming language, maintained in a git-based software repository, and run on a Linux server. It is possible that the software may use the Apache Spark data analysis platform to achieve scalability. <br /><br />The software that the Census Bureau is developing will perform privacy-preserving data analysis using formally private techniques. Examples of such techniques include the literature of differential privacy. <br /><br />The Census Bureau is aware that there is an established industry of consulting firms and other providers who can audit software for security vulnerabilities. However, the Census Bureau is not aware of any companies who can (or have) audited software for privacy vulnerabilities. Examples of privacy vulnerabilities would include the improper mingling of sensitive and non-sensitive data, the movement of data from the sensitive category to the non-sensitive category without having that data undergo a privacy preserving data analysis, and the improper implementation of a privacy preserving algorithm. <br /><br />QUESTIONS:<br /><br />1. Does your company have experience in software auditing? If the answer is yes, please provide:<br /><br />a. A brief description of previous experience in software auditing. <br /><br />b. Name of the US Government agency(ies) for which you have provided software auditing functions, and a point of contact.<br /><br />c. Names of any US corporations for which you have provided software auditing functions that are willing to serve as reference customers, and a point of contact.<br /><br />d. Does your experience extend to the auditing of statistical software? If so, please provide information regarding the kinds of statistical software you have audited, and the purposes for which the audits have been performed.<br /><br />e. Does your experience extend to the auditing of software that implements formally private statistical analysis? If so, please provide information regarding the kinds of privacy preserving analytical software that you have audited, and the purpose for which the audits were performed.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. We understand that companies that have not previously audited privacy preserving statistical software may nevertheless be qualified to audit our software. Please, therefore, provide any experience that you have in developing software that performs privacy preserving data analysis.<br /><br />3. Does your company use any software tools for performing software audits? If the answer is yes, please describe the tools.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Does your company possess any staff who have direct experience in the area of formal privacy? If so, please provide their names and experience, including a publication list.</p>
<p>5. Is there any minimum requirement to engage your services? Does your company require a commitment to a minimum amount of work within a time period?<br /><br />6. The Census Bureau will be making incremental improvements to its privacy preserving statistical software over the course of time. What approaches does your company employ to reduce the cost and non-monetary burdens of subsequent audits?<br /><br />7. What sort of paperwork or certifications does your company issue to signify a completed audit?<br /><br />8. Beyond access to the software being audited, what other sorts of access does your company require? For example, do you require access to the developers, to development specifications, or to test data? <br /><br />9. Which computer languages has your company previously audited?<br /><br />10. What commercial/industry standards does your company employ for mitigating, managing, and preventing data breaches or data being stolen?<br /><br />11. Describe your company's pricing policy. Please provide as much detail as possible, including, to the maximum extent possible, the estimated cost of the auditing on a project, monthly, quarterly, and/or yearly basis, as applicable. Does your company have differential pricing based on the amount work requested?<br /><br />12. Please provide any additional information your company considers to be useful to the Census Bureau during the market research process, including industry-preferred strategies for the acquisition of commercial databases.<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.</p>

<p><br />Title:	Purchase of motor vehicle registrations, leasing, and vehicles-in-operation data used in the estimation of U.S. Gross Domestic Product</p>
<p>1.	BACKGROUND</p>
<p><br />The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is one of the world's leading statistical agencies.  BEA produces economic statistics that enable the government, economists, statisticians, and the public to understand the performance of the Nation's economy.  BEA collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements methodologies, and disseminates statistics to the public.</p>
<p>The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) are among the products produced by BEA and they include measures of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the spending on goods and services of final purchases and reflects consumption spending by households, business investment, and government consumption spending and investment.  Motor vehicle spending is a significant share of spending by businesses and household consumers.</p>
<p>In order to estimate the distribution of motor vehicle purchases to the consumer, business, and the government sectors of the economy, BEA requires source data that allows for the breakout of motor vehicles by registration ownership.</p>
<p>BEA's objective is to procure data on auto and truck registrations by type of owner that can be integrated into BEA's existing estimate processes to breakout monthly estimates of new and used auto and light trucks into those owned by businesses, consumers, and the government.  These data need to be easily integrated into BEA's existing estimation procedures in order to maintain process efficiencies and limit increased costs associated with re-engineering estimation methodologies.</p>
<p>The specific data requirements are included in section II of this statement of work.</p>
<p><br />2.	 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>BEA requires detailed monthly registrations, leasing and vehicles-in-operation data for motor vehicles.  These data shall cover both new and used motor vehicles in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Registrations shall include new and discontinued models. The data are required monthly and must be delivered starting in March of 2018 and go through the twelfth month (February 2019).  <br />3.	  SPECIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>In order for BEA to construct its motor vehicle estimates by sector (consumer, business, government), BEA requires that:</p>
<p>1.	The vendor will provide a detailed monthly data for autos and light trucks.  The data must be provided monthly, in a continuous time series, including revisions to any previous months (back-logs).  The detailed monthly data for autos and light trucks will be provided for each make, model, and model-year and classified by:<br />i.	Company<br />ii.	Dealer/Manufacturer<br />iii.	Federal Government<br />iv.	State and Local Government<br />v.	Personal sector   <br />2.	 The vendor will provide a summary of the monthly registrations.  The data shall be compiled from unique records for new motor vehicles registered, for each vehicle type (Car, Truck and Total). The data must be provided monthly, in a continuous time series, including revisions to any previous months (back-logs).  The data must also be classified by:<br />i.	Company<br />ii.	Dealer/Manufacturer <br />iii.	Federal Government<br />iv.	State and Local Government<br />v.	Personal sector<br />3.	 The vendor will provide monthly data on the change in used auto registrations and the change in used truck registrations. The data must be provided monthly.<br />4.	The vendor will provide monthly data on leasing unit registrations for new vehicles by "registration types," including:<br />i.	Manufacturer sponsored lease (personal),<br />ii.	Independent lease (personal,<br />iii.	Undetermined manufacturer sponsored lease,<br />iv.	Banks &amp; financial institutions,<br />v.	Rental/lease,<br />vi.	Commercial,<br />vii.	Independent lease fleet,<br />viii.	All manufacturer sponsored lease,<br />ix.	All participating independent lease.<br />5.	Monthly data and annual data will be delivered in accordance with the following delivery schedule.</p>
<p>BEA also requires annual-only registrations data for "Autos in Operation" and "Trucks in Operation" data.  These data shall cover both new and used motor vehicles in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Registrations shall include new and discontinued models. The data should be consistent over time and consistent with other auto-and truck-related data sets BEA already uses.  In order for BEA to construct its motor vehicle estimates by sector (consumer, business, government), BEA requires that:</p>
<p>1. 	The vendor will provide annual unit registration data, including any revisions to any previous years (back-logs), on cars-in-operation and trucks-in-operation by model-year. The trucks-in-operation data should include two separate files; one for light trucks-in-operation only, and the other for heavy trucks-in-operation only. The data will reflect the previous year of the calendar year in which the data is provided (i.e. annual-only registration data provided in April of 2018 will be for 2017).</p>

<SUBJECT>J--On-Site Maintenance Services for the NICL Freezer Building and Refrigeration Sys
<SOLNBR>140G0218Q0067
<RESPDATE>013118
<ARCHDATE>02012018
<CONTACT>Williams, Lisa
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING REQUESTED UNDER THIS NOTICE. 

This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes to identify interested firms for the potential requirement detailed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220 (Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors) and the size standard is $15 million. The Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL), Denver, Colorado has a requirement for on-going maintenance services for the NICL freezer building and refrigeration systems, 24-7 on-call emergency repair, periodic rebuilds of Mycom refrigeration reciprocating compressors (4K and 8K), and refrigeration control computer inspection and maintenance. 

Due to USGSs contractual obligations to operate and maintain the NICL for the National Science Foundation, the NICL refrigeration system is required to be operational at all times, serviced and repaired by qualified technicians trained specifically on these types of refrigeration systems, with the ability to procure the parts for necessary repairs. In many instances it is critical that the refrigeration equipment be repaired as soon as possible after a failure.

The NICL, built in 1992, is a specialized facility in Lakewood, CO, which stores about 20,000 meters of ice cores that have been drilled from the worlds ice-covered regions for scientific investigation of the Earths past climate and atmosphere. To date, the cost of acquiring the samples stored in the NICL is approximately $350M; however, due to lack of accessibility to collection sites and environmental changes, recollection of many of the unique samples would be impossible. The ice core samples must be stored at temperatures well below freezing, within narrow ranges of temperature variation. It is not enough that the cores be prevented from melting. If the stored samples warm to approach the freezing point, components of the old air and other trapped substances may migrate out of the ice, misleading researchers analyzing the ice and rendering the samples useless. If the temperatures vary too much, even within a range of subfreezing temperatures, the ice can undergo disastrous structural and chemical changes. 

The NICL freezer facility consists of three rooms of different sizes, each held at a different temperature. The refrigeration system is controlled by a Teletrol refrigeration control computer. The system uses R-22 refrigerant fluid and consists of four 4-cylinder Mycom (4K) reciprocating compressors; two 8-cylinder Mycom (8K) reciprocating compressors; two evaporative condenser towers; four evaporator coils operating at -38o C (-36 o F); two evaporator coils operating as a single evaporator operating at -24 o C (-11 o F); and two evaporator coils operating as a single evaporator operating at approximately +4 o C (+39 o F). 

The -24C room uses one 4k compressor with an online backup to maintain temperature. The      -38C room utilizes a two-stage system consisting of one 4K high stage and one 8K booster compressor; each compressor has an online backup. The +4C dock area is cooled using the        -38C room high stage 4K compressor.

This requirement is for on-site emergency repair as needed and monthly preventative maintenance.  This includes the overall NICL refrigeration system, compressors, evaporative condenser units, freezer evaporators, clean room fans, control computer, and freezer building and its ancillary parts. Services include regularly-scheduled monthly maintenance; as needed repairs; and emergency response and repair for refrigeration or control computer system failures, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays.

Emergency response time: Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of any notification for emergency response to the NICL duty personnel within 30 minutes of receipt of the notification and respond on-site within one hour of notification. 

All business concerns who believe they can responsibly provide this type of service should submit the following information to the contracting officer.

1.	Capability statement describing corporate expertise and technical qualifications in the work described above.
2.	Past performance information describing other contracts for similar services your company has been awarded. Past performance information should be submitted for projects conducted within the last three years and include: project title, location, whether the work was as a prime or subcontractor, contract/subcontract dollar value, type of contract, percentage of self-performed work, and overall performance rating received. 
3.	The firm shall specify that they are either a small business (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.) Or other than small business under the NAICS Code listed in the announcement.
4.	The firm shall provide a point of contact name and e-mail information, and the firms Cage Code, and D&B Number.

NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for quotations. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses received under this announcement.

In order to be responsive to this Notice, a firm must provide the appropriate documentation for consideration by January 31, 2018.  Responses that do not comply with these procedures will not be considered.

Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail to Lisa Williams at ldwilliams@usgs.gov

<RESPDATE>020518
<ARCHDATE>02092018
<CONTACT>Demby, Nicole
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) needs to assess industry interest and capabilities for assisting in the USGS Store obtaining Age Verification Services.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997) and 10.002(b)2)(i) and (iii), this notice is issued solely for information, planning and market research purposes. This Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute a Solicitation or an indication the Government will contract for the products or services contained in this notice. This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this notice. Any response received will not be used as a proposal. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally.

The intent of this RFI is to obtain capability statements from interested parties that can provide Age Verification Services for the USGS Store. The USGS is searching for small business concerns, i.e., 8(a) businesses, HUBZone businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses or service-disable veteran owned small businesses capable of providing the described products or services. Large businesses are also encouraged to respond to this RFI. 

The USGS is also requesting confirmation whether the requested products/services can be obtained through any existing GSA schedules contracts or through open market means. 

The resultant contract, if there is such, is anticipated to be firm fixed price. The procurement is anticipated to occur in FY18. 

RFI REQUIREMENTS: 

US Geological Survey, through the Science Information Delivery Branch (SID) needs to verify eligibility of applicants applying for the America the Beautiful Senior Pass (Lifetime or annual pass). Eligible applicants are U.S. citizens or permanent residents age 62 or over.

Orders for the Senior Pass are currently placed online at store.usgs.gov or by mailing in an application to SID. Applicants submit their application via the mail, along with identification proving eligibility such as U.S. Drivers License, Green Card or U.S. Passport. SID Staff are then required to review application and ID to verify eligibility. This is a time-consuming process and becomes problematic as the number of orders increases. Online customers who order their Senior Pass are required to upload proof of eligibility.  SID Staff are then required to review the uploaded documentation then release the order for fulfillment.  In 2017, in response to a price increase on the Senior Pass, the NPS partnered with a 3rd party vendor to perform age verification. Customers were redirected from the USGS Store to this 3rd party to perform age verification and to complete the purchase of their pass. Those customers that could not be verified were redirected back to the USGS Store and were required to upload proof of eligibility.

Application is NPS Form 10-595 (Rev 12/2016); SID stands for Science Information Delivery; USGS Store is store.usgs.gov.

Science Information Delivery (SID) wants a verification service as part of the America the Beautiful Senior Pass ordering process on the USGS Store (store.usgs.gov). This service would validate the customers' legal name and verify they meet the Age requirements and U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident requirement. Science Information Delivery would like this service to be at the start of the ordering process. The customer visits the USGS Store and selects either the Lifetime Senior Pass or the Annual Senior Pass. After putting the Senior Pass into their shopping cart, they are routed to the 3rd party site (if necessary) where they add the necessary information to verify their eligibility (first name, middle name, last name, address, phone number, and last 4 of Social Security Number). The verification service takes just a few seconds and when the customer's eligibility is verified they are returned to the USGS Store to complete their purchase. The 3rd party vendor also sends information proving validation back to the USGS Store. Those customers that cannot be verified are returned to the USGS Store where they are allowed to complete their purchase using previous methods.

Technical Requirements

We expect the vendor to verify the customer is 62 or older and that they are a U.S. Citizen or Legal Resident. We expect this process to be completed within 10 seconds so the customer can complete their order in the USGS Store. We also expect the vendor to return data points that prove eligibility so we can complete the order for the customer. Those customers that cannot be validated would be returned to the USGS Store. 

The vendor should demonstrate that consumer data is secure and will not be utilized for any purpose other to verify eligibility for the Senior Pass. This includes both direct and indirect collected data.

It is expected that the vendor could verify a minimum 85% of customer's eligibility requests.

Vendor and SID will coordinate system outages so proper notification to store visitors can be advertised on the USGS Store.

The solution should be compatible with the USGS Store which runs on Drupal. 

The customer data provided includes PII and needs to be protected per DOI Policy and USGS Policy. Guidance can be found here: https://www.doi.gov/privacy https://www2.usgs.gov/laws/privacy.html


Deliverables
	
A secure web site that allows customers to enter their information into the vendor's site to verify eligibility and then returns the customer to the USGS Store to complete the purchase. The vendor would also send some data points that state whether the customer has been verified as eligible or not. 

Science Information Delivery wants this in place within 45 days of award. SID would like a walk-through of how the process would work before the project starts and other times that seem appropriate. 

Workflow diagram and documentation detailing process the customer will follow during verification.       

ACTION: Interested vendors who believe they have the capability to provide the required product/services as defined are invited to submit a Capability Statement, not to exceed 5 pages including attachments, exhibits, etc. Response should include the following information: 

1. Company name, address, point of contact, email address, and business type (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, veteran-owned small business, etc.). 

2. GSA Schedule Contract Information if applicable

3. Capabilities Statement

4. Approximate cost information (i.e. rough order of magnitude). 

5. Past performance information should be submitted for similar projects conducted within the last three (3) years. If possible, three (3) past performance examples are desired. 

6. Do not provide only general brochures or generic information.

USGS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this notice.

Interested vendors must provide their response via email to the Contract Specialist, Nicole Demby, ndemby@usgs.gov with the subject line reading "USGS Store Age Verification Services

Responses are due via email to ndemby@usgs.gov by 2:00 PM ET, Monday, February 5, 2018. The response must be specific to the RFI requirements/qualifications listed above.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for Bulkhead Replacement at the East Boat Basin of the Cape Cod Canal located in Sandwich, Massachusetts to determine the interest, availability and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned, and Small Business concerns as described below. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued on or about April/May 2018. The project will begin in the summer and fall of 2018 and is expected to take about nine months, including submittal approval. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.
<p>This project consists of completing the following tasks:</p>
<p>-Install approximately 900 feet of steel sheet piles on the east side of the boat basin<br />-Connect the new sheet piles to the existing dead men and tie-back rods<br />- Cut off old sheet piles approximately 10 feet below grade<br />-Construct sidewalks, railings and fender system<br />-Relocate overhead electrical wires and lights<br />-Site grading and drainage<br />-Miscellaneous minor site work</p>
<p>The East Boat Basin is located in Sandwich, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. The existing bulkhead system was installed in the 1980's and is in poor condition. There are sheet pile bulkheads on both sides of the harbor entrance. This project is to install a new sheet pile bulkhead system on the east side of the harbor entrance. The west side will be completed under a future contract. The existing sheet piles range from 50' to 70' in length. The new sheet pile system will be similar. Ancillary site work will include sidewalks, fenders, railings, drainage, site lighting, etc. The work will require use of large excavating equipment and pile driving equipment. Although much of the work can be done from the landward side, some work from the water side will be necessary. Due to working in a navigable waterway, there will be environmental restrictions and considerations.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (e.g. HUBZone, etc.), as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work components stated above. Please include at least two specific examples of the firm's experience performing the work requirements stated above. The projects must have been performed within the last ten years.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY:  This announcement is seeking information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE.  The primary purpose of this notice is to conduct market research to determine if there are a sufficient number of qualified and interested Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and/or Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), capable of performing the required services, to warrant a solicitation set-aside in accordance with the requirements of Public Law 109-461, however businesses of all sizes are highly encouraged to respond.
Applicable NAICS code is 561422, Telemarketing Bureaus and Other Contact Centers, and small business size standard of $15 Million.  
Background:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is actively looking for ways to put Veterans in control of how they receive services and interact with VA. Modernization efforts are occurring across the Department to include changes to how Veterans  disagreements with decisions on benefit claims are resolved. On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Appeals Modernization Act; Public Law 115-55), creating a new claims and appeals process for resolving disagreements on VA s decisions on benefits claims. The new process provides Veterans streamlined choices for seeking review of VA s decision.
While the law will not be fully implemented until February 2019, in an effort to provide some of the benefits of the new law s streamlined process, VA initiated the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). This initiative allows participants the option to have their decisions reviewed in the Higher-Level Review or Supplemental Claim lanes, as outlined in the new law. Participation in RAMP is voluntary and by invitation only; however, eligible Veterans can expect to receive a review of VA s decision on their claim much faster in RAMP than if they were to remain in the legacy appeals process. The RAMP initiative began on November 1, 2017 with the initial mailing of RAMP Opt-In letters sent to Veterans with some of the oldest pending appeals and will continue until the new law is fully implemented no earlier than February 2019.
Scope:  See attached draft PWS for more detailed information
The VA is seeking a Contractor knowledgeable of industry best practices in customer service; call center operations, and prescribed rules of conduct concerning government information dissemination.

<DESC><strong>Industry Day Announcement</strong><br /><br />The U.S. Army will sponsor a Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) - Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Industry Day tentatively scheduled for 27-28 February 2018 in Huntsville, AL. The LTAMDS prototype development and demonstration will be conducted as part of a Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) program that includes relevant TMRR design reviews to include a System Requirements Review (SRR), System Functional Review (SFR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a demonstration of the LTAMDS integrated prototype.  The objectives for the TMRR phase of the program will be discussed in detail during the industry day; however, primary focus of this phase will include mature radar technologies that allow prototype demonstrations of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or more at the component, subsystem, and integrated prototype levels. The LTAMDS integrated prototype will require incorporation of advanced radar technologies to include an open system architecture.  Technologies incorporated into LTAMDS should consider power, cooling, transportability, reliability, obsolescence, and affordability. The prototype LTAMDS radar must be interoperable with Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) command / control and PATRIOT Advanced Capability - 3 (PAC-3) class of interceptors, and meet the performance requirements as defined in the LTAMDS performance specification.<br /><br />The Government intends to use the DOTC OTA to potentially fund up to three (3) vendors for TMRR beginning in FY18 and beyond. The expected prototype deliverable quantity is one (1) demonstration report per technology selected. The feasibility of the prototype will be demonstrated and tested by the Contractor and witnessed by the Government. The prototype is applicable to the U.S. LTAMDS program and will be a component of the AIAMD System of Systems architecture.<br /><br />The goal of the industry day are to 1) familiarize participants with the performance requirements, 2) identify potential offerors and promote understanding of the OTA proposal requirements, and 3) provide vendors and government personnel an opportunity for one-on-one performance requirements discussions and how they relate to potential design solutions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration<br /><br /></span>All interested parties are required to submit visit requests for this event.

<DESC><strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />1.0 Purpose</strong>
<p>A Request for Solutions (RFS) has been issued to locate capable vendors with the ability to deliver a unique solution for the System-of-Systems Controlled Environment Test Infrastructure (SCETI) requirement.</p>
<p>The RFS has been issued as an opportunity under the Training and Readiness Accelerator (TReX).</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the solutions with the intent of awarding an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) in accordance with 10 U.S. Code &sect; 2371b.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Summary and Background </strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Army is interested in improving its test capability for sensors used in degraded visual environments (DVE) conditions, including dust and heavy rain. Current Government test capabilities allow for testing in live-flight (manned rotary winged tests), which provides realistic flight mechanics but comes with significant costs and risks - or in a laboratory setting, which is low cost but does not provide realistic mechanics. Additionally, in live flight test, the environments to which the system under test (SUT) can be exposed to are limited and non-repeatable.</p>
<p>In order to improve this test capability, the U.S. Army is interested in prototyping a system that will place sensor assemblies into low cost emulated flight through artificial repeatable rain and dust DVEs characterized by instrumentation in order to directly enhance the readiness and capability of Army aviation platforms. The full SCETI capability will be delivered to Redstone Test Center. A stand-alone copy of the dust measurement suite will be delivered to Yuma Test Center.</p>
<p><strong>The full RFS and Technical Supplement can be viewed on the TReX website, located at the following link: </strong><a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/system-of-systems-controlled-environment-test-infrastructure-sceti/"><strong>https://trainingaccelerator.org/system-of-systems-controlled-environment-test-infrastructure-sceti/</strong></a></p>

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p><br />NMCARS<br />NMCARS 5237.102-90 Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)<br />The contractor shall report contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the [NAMED COMPONENT] via a secure data collection site. Contracted services excluded from reporting are based on Product Service Codes (PSCs). The excluded PSCs are:</p>
<p>(1) W, Lease/Rental of Equipment; <br />(2) X, Lease/Rental of Facilities; <br />(3) Y, Construction of Structures and Facilities; <br />(4) D, Automatic Data Processing and Telecommunications, IT and Telecom- Telecommunications Transmission (D304) and Internet (D322) ONLY;<br />(5) S, Utilities ONLY; <br />(6) V, Freight and Shipping ONLY.</p>
<p>The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address https://www.ecmra.mil.</p>
<p>Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 1 through September 30.

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p><br />NMCARS<br />NMCARS 5237.102-90 Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)<br />The contractor shall report contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the [NAMED COMPONENT] via a secure data collection site. Contracted services excluded from reporting are based on Product Service Codes (PSCs). The excluded PSCs are:</p>
<p>(1) W, Lease/Rental of Equipment; <br />(2) X, Lease/Rental of Facilities; <br />(3) Y, Construction of Structures and Facilities; <br />(4) D, Automatic Data Processing and Telecommunications, IT and Telecom- Telecommunications Transmission (D304) and Internet (D322) ONLY;<br />(5) S, Utilities ONLY; <br />(6) V, Freight and Shipping ONLY.</p>

<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.</p>
<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<p>Issue Date: 24 JANUARY 2018 - Closing Date: 19 FEBRUARY 2018 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for TR-333 Hydrophone Windows (P/N: 6029148-301), Hydrophone Cables (P/N: 6933090-303), Thermistor Cables (P/N: 6933090-304), and Transducer Cables (P/N: 6933090305). The window is a rubber boot that is mounted over the TR-333 Hydrophone Sensor. The cables are underwater cables to be used as replacement assets during normal refit/replenish/replacement operations. TR-333 Hydrophone Window and Cables are part of the TRIDENT Submarine SP24 Navigation Program. For review of technical requirements, please see attached drawings 6029148 and 6933090. In order to access these drawings, vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP). More information about the JCP is located at https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the current certified source, Ducommun Labarge Technologies Inc., 1505 S Maiden Lane, Joplin, UT 64801-3819, (CAGE 16275). This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition to the Hydrophone Window and Cables is to avoid roughly $3.633 million in cost duplication and prevent as much as two years unnecessary schedule impact. The program requires critical component suppliers to go through an extensive qualification plan, to include inspection, certification, first article testing, and operational testing. The Government has expended considerable effort and expense to develop the current certified source. The estimated cost to restore capability if a different vendor's Hydrophone Window and cabling is procured is projected to be roughly $3.633 million higher than the proposed cost to utilize an existing certified source.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government's requirement and certification requirements for TR-333 Hydrophone Window and Cables may respond. Responses shall address how the Government can offset the estimated $3.633 million in cost duplication and the schedule delay that are anticipated to result if a new source is utilized.</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the significant Government investment in the existing TR-333 Hydrophone Window and Cable.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-18-S-NB47</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement. The POC for this effort is Steven.Junkins1@navy.mil or 812-854-8833. The mailing address is:</p>
<p>NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane<br />Attention Steven Junkins, Code 0221, Bldg 121<br />300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI/sources sought may be emailed to the POC above.</p>
<p>If any part of the submittal is classified, please contact the POC for appropriate submission information.</p>
<p>All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT for the sole source procurement of the extension of services of an existing contract with General Dynamics One Source, who is providing IT Services to the National Defense University.  The contracting activity is NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083.   
The services include an extension of the services currently provided through an existing contractual vehicle,  from 13 Jan 2018 to 28 Feb 2018.   The extension will allow for a long-term competitive follow-on contract to be implemented.  Competition of the requirement and award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of effort, and would result in disjointed management and provision of the established IT Services.
 
Challengers may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending challenges to Cathy Kelly at cathy.kelly@navy.mil. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all challenges to this sole source determination received within one day after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>3. Provide support throughout the life cycle of the program with a thorough understanding of advanced Telemedicine technologies and the environment they will be integrated into.</p>
<p>4. Support PjM MME in the development of acquisition / contracting documentation and analysis.

VERICUT enables NC programmers to correct errors before the program is ever loaded on the CNC machine,</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">thereby eliminating manual prove-outs. VERICUT also optimizes NC programming cutting speeds for more efficient machining. VERICUT software was selected primarily for its compatibility with CATIA software, and no other sources are known that can provide the technical features VERICUT offers. The additional CATIA V5 Model Interface will add mission capability by allowing 3D CAD models to be imported directly without the use of a separate CAD/CAM system to read/write the formats. The software maintenance sought would provide phone/email support, software updates/upgrades, and license file support. The software is used with restricted rights by the government. The technical data, specifications, and engineering data are proprietary to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), CGTEch. CGTech has no third-party resellers and does not authorize any other source to provide warranty support. The cost of the application license and annual maintenance is far more cost effective than attempting to replace the Government's existing software licenses and retrain personnel on a different software system. Attempts to replace the software with another system would create undue incompatibility risk and delay the mission.</span></p>

(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).

(iv) The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.

(a) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB);

(b) Veteran-owned small business (VOSB);

All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.
The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract. Accordingly, the VA reserves the right enforce any of its contractual remedies.
