<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to the Institute of Development Management (IDM) for the training of public health managers in the CDC's Sustainable Management Development Program (SMDP) in Botswana. 

Management of public health programs, particularly HIV/AIDS programs, remains a weak link in the provision of sound HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support services translating into poor service delivery, low quality, program inefficiencies and reduced staff morale. Building health care systems to enable quality implementation of USG supported HIV/AIDS programs falls within the mandate of PEPFAR. HHS/CDC has developed a training program that addresses these weaknesses and promotes organizational excellence in public health by strengthening leadership and management capacity. 

The purpose of this contract is to:  
(1)  Implement CDC's SMDP training and provide follow up support to build managerial and leadership capacity of public health managers to improve and sustain the implementation of PEPFAR funded HIV/AIDS programs and provide effective and efficient services, and; (2) adapt CDC's Couple HIV Counseling and Testing Curriculum to the Botswana situation to further HIV prevention efforts.

It is imperative to utilize IDM for this contract.  IDM has the unique qualifications of being established by the Governments of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland to provide training, consultancy and research services in this area to government, parastatal and private organizations.  At present they are the only known, qualified organization in the area for these services. 

The North American Industry Classification Code is 624190.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered.  A determination not to compete based on responses received and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equpiment in this procurement as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirement as a key component of the Department's enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Dell Enterprise Systems Silver Service extended warranties for Dell servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use several Dell servers, Dell PowerEdge 6650, Dell PowerEdge 1750, and Dell PowerEdge 2650.  This Dell tape library is used to support Domestic Operations at SA-1.  The warranties for four (4) Dell PowerEdge 6650s expired on October 27, 2006, sixteen (16) Dell PowerEdge 1750s expired on April 13, 2007, two (2) Dell PowerEdge 1750s on April 14, 2007, and the five (5) Dell PowerEdge 2650s expired on April 15, 2007; the hardware is no longer covered by Dell.  The servers, however, are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/DO.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that Dell will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Due to CA’s investment and overall satisfaction with the Dell tape library and the service Dell provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Dell tape library.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Government’s best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.<BR><BR>

<ARCHDATE>03042008
<CONTACT>Irie Clarke, Contracting Officer, 202-287-1421, Irie.Clarke@HQ.DOE.GOV;Albert Manley, Contract Specialist, 202-287-1438, albert.manley@pr.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Health, Safety, and Security , Office of Classification (OC) intends to extend the period of performance of contract number DE-AC01-04SO20188 with CSC Systems & Solutions LLC (CSC) on a sole source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support while a new competitive procurement is competed that will replace the CSC contract. See FedBizOpps Synopsis number DE-RP01-07HS07002 issued on March 1, 2007 (the RFP). Proposals have been submitted, evaluation is underway, and award is anticipated under the RFP in the near future. The extension will continue the performance period for an initial three month period and shall include three (3) additional three-month option periods. However, it is possible that no extension will be required (i.e., award is made before the expiration of the CSC contract, no challenge against an award under the RFP is made, and the CSC contract can be transitioned to the new contract awarded under the RFP).  However, in an abundance of caution, this extension is intended to ensure continuity of services in case the award is challenged and to provide for a transition period to the new contract as provided in the RFP.  The extended period of performance will be from September 22, 2007 through September 21, 2008. The first three month option period starts December 22, 2007 and the second three month period starts March 22, 2008. This extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required time-frame. To DOEâ€™s knowledge and belief, only CSC has the requisite number of Q cleared personnel with the highly specialized technical experience to ensure that the OCâ€™s requirements are met within the required delivery schedules. No other firm has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to assume the critical, highly specialized technical support without interruption, pending the award of a new contact under the RFP and the transition from the CSC contract to the new contract awarded under the RFP. The present contract with CSC ends on September 21, 2007; THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. Interested, responsible sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the Department. Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. CSC currently provides specialized technical, analytical and administrative support services in support of: a - the development, revision, review and production of classification and control guidance; b- the development, revision, and review of policy and procedures, including supporting appraisals of the Departments classification and controls programs; c- support in the development of education coursework and the provision of training related to classification and control requirements; and d- general administrative, file room, and mail room management support involving classified materials. All support provided is required to be in accordance with DOE Order 471.1A, Identification and Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information; DOE Manual 470.4-4, Information Security; DOE Manual 475.1-1A, Identifying Classified Information; the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, including implementing regulations; the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, including implementing regulations; Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, including implementing regulations; 32 Code of Federal Regulations, CFR Chapter XX, Information Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration; 10 CFR Part 1017, Identification and Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information; 10 CFR Part 1045, Nuclear Classification and Declassification, and all other applicable regulations and di rectives. The level-of-effort for the three-month extended period of performance is 18,036 Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) and 18,036 DPLHs for each of the three (3) three-month option periods. The estimated ceiling price for the three-month extended period of performance is $1.4 million; it is anticipated that similar ceilings would be applicable to option periods. It is estimated that the level-of-effort will require approximately 42 full-time equivalent personnel: Key personnel: one Program Manager; one Senior Technical Analyst; one Senior Policy Analyst; and one Senior Trainer. Non-key personnel: Policy Analysts, Technical Analysts, Administrative Assistants, Training Specialists, File Room Clerks, Document Reviewers, File Room Supervisors, Security Assistant, and Training Assistant. All personnel performing under this effort are required to possess a current DOE Q access security clearance. Personnel supporting the policy and procedures effort are required to have a high level of expertise relative to classification/declassification and unclassified controlled information policy. Technical personnel supporting the classification and controls effort are required to have specialized nuclear-related classification experience, and must be authorized Derivative Classifiers, Derivative Declassifiers or Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information, UCNI Reviewing Officials. Training personnel must meet similar qualifications as the classification and controls personnel, but must also have training experience in the classification and controls area. The Statement of Work and the Position Qualifications for the CSC contract are provided on the Departmentâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System. The following areas of expertise will be required to respond to current and likely future work during the option time periods: nuclear materials production, material control and accountability inventories/nuclear material inventories, isotope separation technology/atomic vapor laser isotope separation technology, gaseous diffusion technology, gas centrifuge technology, proliferant enrichment technology, fissile material fuel processing, nuclear weapons design and testing, arms control and nonproliferation, radiological emergency response, radioactive dispersal devices, improvised nuclear devices, international programs such as the URENCO centrifuge, United Kingdom material transfers, space nuclear reactors, safeguards and security, radioactive waste transportation, and chemical/biological technology. Any responding party must provide a capability statement demonstrating its capability, as discussed above, which must include the following, as these items are necessary to demonstrate that the responding party is capable of performing the contemplated work without interruption: (1) a statement that proposed personnel are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; or a letter of commitment from personnel that the responding party intends to use to perform the contemplated work who are not currently employed by the responding party, demonstrating that they will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) a chart or other synopsis of the educational and experience qualifications of personnel proposed for the contemplated work; (3) a chart or other synopsis demonstrating that proposed personnel currently hold a â€œQâ€ access authorization; (4) a copy of any teaming, subcontract, or other agreement between any parties that would be performing the contemplated work as part of a team; and (5) a certification that the responding party possesses a facility security clearance and complies with the Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence, FOCI program.

ArcGIS is a collection of ESRI products which includes ArcInfo and ArcView as well as several extensions to the base product.  ArcInfo is the most complete system in the ArcGIS Desktop product suite and allows automation and input of multiple types of data, advanced spatial analysis, and raster processing, whereas ArcView allows for data editing and processing.  This request is to purchase 1 concurrent use (CU) license for ArcInfo, 4 CU licenses for ArcView, and 1 CU license for the Spatial Analyst extension.  The purchase of this software will include 1 full year of maintenance.  In addition to the tools and data available with the purchase of the ESRI GIS software, is the access to vast library of knowledge and support from other GIS professionals, the developers of the software, and technical support staff.  The maintenance of this software includes all performance and security service packages as well as copies of new releases of the software.  The maintenance agreement accompanying this purchase also entitles the purchasing group to admission for one of their employees to ESRI?s Annual International User?s Conference.

The Agency?s Office of Strategic Information, Research and Planning (OSIRP) uses the survey data internally for planning and performance measurement, as well as to provide feedback to staff at the individual country level.  In fiscal year 2006, there were 7,749 PC Volunteers and Trainees that served in 73 countries.  The surveys are anonymous, self-reported questionnaires that eligible PC Volunteers complete on paper or online via a secure online internet connection.

Through the biennial ?All Volunteer? survey conducted in 2006, almost 5,000 surveys were completed (60% online and 40% paper) over a three-month period.  The other survey is administered continually throughout the year to groups of Volunteers as they near the end of their Peace Corps service; Volunteers complete the survey either in groups in their country of service or individually, with about 80% completing the survey online.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition 2001-03. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAISC) is 541990 and the business size maximum is $5.0 million. The proposed contract is an Indian-owned Set Aside under the authority of the Buy Indian Act 25 U.S.C 47. All small businesses shall comply with FAR 52.29-14 Limitations on Subcontracting. All responsible Indian-owned business sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by the government. All Indian-owned companies shall complete a Buy Indian Certification, which shall be provided by the Contracting Officer to the company, prior to award. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Potential offerors may register at www.ccr.gov.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs’(BIA)Office of Justice Services (OJS), Native American tribal governments and tribal court personnel will conduct reviews of selected tribal court grantees and execute/implement tribal court improvement plans for each grantee.

The contractor shall identify strengths and weaknesses relative to functions for which Federal funds are allocated and make a determination as to whether a court will receive an acceptable rating with the federal funds allocated for tribal court operations. The contractor will also develop a list of potential judges that could serve as tribal judges where vacancies occur or are identified to exist in Indian country.  The contractor will rely on tribal constitutions, organic tribal law, law and order codes, manuals, etc., developed by each tribal court to evaluate the tribal courts’ operations.    This contract is necessary to continue the ongoing process of performing tribal court reviews that began in Fiscal Year 2006.

The contractor will be required to review from 10 to 15 tribal or CFR courts each year, the specific numbers of courts to be identified at the beginning of each fiscal year through discussions between OJS and the contractor. The tribal courts to be reviewed will be selected from the 156 courts receiving funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The courts are located on Indian reservations throughout the United States. For the initial year of this contract, the contractor will be required to conduct reviews of the following three tribal courts:  1.) Cheyenne River Sioux; 2.) Oglala Sioux; and 3.) Rosebud Sioux.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for a project on wound healing in transgenic rodents.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide the Intramural Research Program (IRP) with data on wound healing in aging rodents.   The contractor will perform wound healing studies on aging rodents to examine inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.  The role of aging in inhibiting wound healing is not  known clearly.  In addition, it is unclear how age interacts with inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.  This contract will design experiments and collect data on factors that promote or inhibit wound healing in aging rodents as a model for investigating tissue regeneration.  The National Institute on Aging, IRP conducts research on rodent caloric restriction and other dietary changes, wound healing, genetics, immunology, and medicine.  This project examines age-associated changes tissue regeneration using wound healing in aging rodents as models to investigate inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  The cited authority is applicable because Johns Hopkins is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Newcomer, JHU, is widely recognized as an expert in animal research, and in using transgenic models in particular.  His recent paper on septicemia and peritonitis (Contemp Top Lab Anim Sci 2005 Jan 44:35-7) is one of several demonstrating the breadth and depth of his research background and experience.  The close proximity of Dr. Newcomer?s laboratory facilities to the National Institute of Aging is a crucial component of this contract.  We must transport reagents and samples between NIA and Dr. Newcomer?s laboratory in a timely fashion.  Commercial transport is not available for animals in fragile condition undergoing wound healing experiments.  No other source other than Johns Hopkins can meet the requirements of this procurement because no other source has the same proximity to NIA with the same level of expertise in these experiments.  A survey of the literature in this field and a survey of local facilities show that there are no other sources for these services.  The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6,
Competition Requirement.

<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:<br>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOps) for a parcel of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land within a 50-mile radius to the West and North and a 25-mile radius to the South and East of the city center of Baton Rouge, Louisiana to the west and north.  General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with the owner whose parcel of land is technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government.<br><br>

The intended use of the leased land is to provide storage for approximately 40,000 travel trailers and/or mobile homes which were used by the Louisiana Housing Task Force as temporary emergency housing units (EHU) to those individuals displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  These EHU will not be occupied.<br><br>

FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  In making a determination, the GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies' guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the site.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for the intended use by the Government.  Those individuals responding with an expression of interest that meet these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the SFO will be considered for award.<br><br>

Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br><br>

1.	Land which is located within 50-mile radius to the West and North and a 25-mile radius to the South and East of the city center of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.<br>
2.	Parcels of Land no smaller than 300 and no larger than 600 acres.<br>
3.	Land that is flat and hard-surfaced (no loose soil), cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to support travel trailers and mobile homes.<br>
4. 	Land owner will allow FEMA's placement of gravel/rock on roadways and lanes on the property with possible culvert/piping to make property more accessible and conducive to staging travel trailers and mobile homes.<br>
5.	Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads.  Preference is for land with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads.<br>
6.	Land that is near water, sewerage and electric service is preferred.<br>
7.	Land that is not wetlands.<br>
8.	Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements, and any other necessary approvals fro government intended use.<br>
9.	Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations.<br><br>
The expression of interest should include, as a minimum, the following information: <br><br>

1.	Owner name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address if available.<br>
2.	Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land (e.g. copy of deed, mortgage document, or master lease stating the ability to sublease for the government?s intended use).<br>
3.	A legal description of the property.<br>
4.	Description of the land:  size (number of acres), physical characteristics, past and current use.<br>
5.	Location of the land:  including the municipal (physical) address, city, parish, and a small map showing the location and access to the property.<br>
6.	Picture of the site.<br>
7.	If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner showing authority to represent the owner.<br><br>

All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:<br><br>
General Services Administration<br> 
Expression of Interest to Vacant Land<br>
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd., Suite 150<br>
Baton Rouge, LA 70816<br><br>

SOLICITATION PROCESS:<br><br>
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  The leasing action will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.<br><br>

DELINEATED AREA:<br><br><bold>
Property offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within a 25-mile radius to the South and East and a 50-mile radius to the North and West of the city center of Baton Rouge, in the State of Louisiana.<br><br>

LEASE TERM:<br><br>
A 2-year lease with a 1- year firm term. <br><br>

RENTAL RATE:<br><br>
An annual rate of return on the estimated value of the selected site is offered as a lease rental payment.  The Government will not accept an increased value assessment or an excessive interest rate due to the nature of this requirement.  The intent of the Government is not to operate a commercial business on the property and, therefore, there is no income for consideration in determining a fair rental rate.<br><br>

RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FORM:<br><br>
The owner will be required to provide access and entry onto the property to FEMA and its representatives for the purpose of performance of environmental and other assessment to determine technical feasibility for intended use.<br>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronic Program Office (PMA-209) to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0024 with Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is assigned responsibility for the planning, programming, budgeting, procurement, installation, operation, and support of the Air Combat Electronics programs.  The F-16 lacks a robust secure Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) communications system to fully integrate with composite combat forces.  Current operations in mountainous and other inhospitable environments are under increasing risk of compromise requiring reduced response times during air support missions  A secure, robust LOS/BLOS communications capability will greatly enhance Close Air Support and Combat Search and Rescue operations.  The purpose of this tasking is to acquire Non-recurring engineering, production representative Group A kits, and system familiarization from Rockwell Collins in support of integrating the ARC-210 System onto USAF Block 30-32 F-16?s.  As Rockwell Collins is the sole developer of the ARC-210 Family of products and related ancillary equipment and maintain the proprietary rights to this radio, they are the only capable source that can provide the integration required.  This effort is to be completed no later than February 2008.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

Aesculap's Sonastar XS-E is required because it is a fully self-contained console with built-in irrigation.  Also, when combined with an electrosurgical unit the Sonastar system is capable of performing monopolar electro surgery through the same hand piece.  Finally, Sonastar has a unique bone shaving tip for precise bone removal.  The required system shall have clearances from the Food and Drug Administration for marketing in the United States for neurosurgical applications.  The product shall have cooling in the hand piece, integrated irrigation, and capable of integrating with electrosurgical units.  The product shall have available different hand pieces designed for the ergonomic requirements.  The product shall operate from 115 VAC, 60 Hertz power.  Based on the above information, only the Sonastar XS-E Ultrasonic Aspirator System, manufactured by Aesculap Inc., meets the agency's needs.

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR 13.106-1(b).  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing a product that meets the minimum requirements of the agency.  Interested parties shall be able to show a previous history of providing the neurological surgical ultrasonic aspirator system described earlier.

A determination by the Government to only negotiate with Aesculap based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a open procurement that is open to vendors that can provide a neurological surgical ultrasonic aspirator system.

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Russell Grabill at russell.grabill@med.navy.mil.  Statements are due by 1600 (4:00 p.m.) Eastern Standard Time on 14 August 2007.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>Franchising has been hailed by several international organizations (e.g. the African Development Bank), as one of the most efficient ways to create new firms and economic growth in Africa.  As part of a U.S. Government inter-agency process, the Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (1) has been providing technical assistance to some African governments and/or associations to create the legislative and legal framework required for franchising to thrive.  
In furtherance of these activities, CLDP is planning to contract with an advisor (The Contractor) who can provide legal expertise to associations in North Africa (and particularly in Algeria), notably by developing model contracts that would ensure that local franchisees enter into fair and balanced contracts with franchisors.
Through the present contract, the Contractor will work closely with CLDP in providing legal expertise to associations in North Africa (and particularly in Algeria), as they seek to make franchising a reality in their country.

In particular, the Contractor may be called upon by CLDP to do the following:

<CONTACT>Kathleen S Policicchio Contract Specialist 412-365-5438
<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with American Medical Depot, 4380 NW 135th Street, Opa Locka, Florida 33054-4418 for the Selecta II Glaucoma Laser System.  This system is a Q-switched 532nd: YAG laser that is used in a procedure called Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT).  Cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2001, this new system features a patented technique for performing trabeculoplasty in patients with open-angle glaucoma.  It selectively targets pigmented cells and increases fluid output, lowering intraocular pressure.  Equipped with a Q-switch the Selecta II produces a 3 nanosecond high-energy beam of light.  This beam of light induces the same cell replacement mechanism as traditional argon laser therapy (ALT), but without the burn.  The short pulse of the laser does not permit time for heat to spread to other cells.  SLT distributes just enough energy to the trabecular meshwork T to target specific melanin-rich cells.  This avoids thermal damage and scarring to adjacent non-melanin cells. This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Vendors who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than COB August 9, 2007.  Such notification must include a complete description of equipment including narrative and capabilities described above.  Responses may be sent to Kathleen.Policicchio@va.gov or mailed to Kathleen Policicchio, Contracting Officer, (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>David Dilks, 978-318-8869
<DESC>With this announcement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues a pre-solicitation notice for the following project: Shoreline stabilization project is located along State Route 191 (Cutler Rd) in Whiting, ME.  The project involves placement of a sto ne slope revetment along 500 feet of Holmes Bay, which will tie-in with an existing stone revetment.  The new stone revetment plan consists of clearing and grubbing vegetation on the existing slope prior to the placement of a non-woven geotextile fabric, a  1 foot thick layer of granular fill and 2 feet of stone armor protection then be placed on top at a 1:3 slope.  On the upper slope, 8 inches of topsoil soil be placed and the area will be seeded and planted with regional coastal plantings.  The revetment would be approximately 500 linear feet and 20 feet high (elevation 20.0 North American Vertical Datum (NAVD)).  The stone toe will be buried to approximate elevation 9.0 NAVD to accommodate restoration of intertidal habitat. 	The toe of the revetment will be constructed in 30-foot sections.  Saltmarsh cordgrass growing within the 6,000 square foot revetment toe area, will be removed with the root mass intact and marsh soils excavated and stockpiled.  These excavated materials will be reused during the backfill process as each section of the buried toe is completed.  	The upper area of the revetment, from elevation 20.0 feet NAVD to the top of the bank (variable elevation) will be planted with native coastal grasses and shrubs, such as speckled alder.  Coastal plantings on the upper slope will replace lost riparian fun ction and will provide an effective riparian buffer between the road and the marsh.   	Construction will be undertaken from land during the dry portion of the tidal cycle and is expected to take about six months to complete.  Appropriate erosion control measures will be implemented throughout construction including (but not limited to) inst allation of a hanging silt curtain to minimize migration of fine materials during excavation and construction activities.  Contractor will remove fine material collected behind erosion control structures prior to removal of these structures.  Contractor re quired to submit a Sediment Erosion Control Plan for Corps approval prior to commencement of construction activities.  These measures will assure minimal water quality impact to sensitive fish and benthic resources and provide a net gain of saltmarsh habit at. Construction vehicles should not be located in water throughout the duration of the project. The estimated cost of this work is between $750,000 and $1,300,000.  This solicitation is 100% Set-Aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns.  The NAICS code for the work is 237990 with a small business size standard of $31 million. The solicitation shall be made available via the Internet on or about 20 August 2007.  To download the solicitation, prospective contractors shall register with and download the solicitation from www.fedteds.gov. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendment s, if any, will be available at this Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for: - 5 Compliance Platform Windows Desktop Bundle – (quantity required 200) - C5 Compliance Platform Windows Desktop Bundle Platinum Maintenance – (quantity required 200) - C5 Compliance Platform Windows Server Bundle – (quantity required 2) - C5 Compliance Platform Windows Server Bundle Platinum Maintenance – (quantity required 2) - C5 Compliance Platform Element Manager Server – (quantity required 1) - C5 Compliance Platform Element Manager Server Platinum Maintenance – (quantity required 1) - 5 Days on-Site Advanced Deployment - Two Day Administrator Training on Site – 8 Seats NASA/GRC intends to purchase the item from Secure Elements Inc.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:   - The purchase for the C5 compliance platform tool is of critical importance to the Code R Security Program.  The SCAP (Security Content Automation Project) project is being developed by NIST (National Institute of Standards & technology) in support of Government Mandated security requirements.  Code R needs to meet these requirements ASAP and thus requires a tool that can facilitate this process. The NIST SCAP site currently lists only 3 tools that support the protocol and functions.  The Secure Elements tool receives the highest rating by NIST with regards to how the SCAP protocol is implemented and supported.	The other two tools are not yet available for purchase.   Therefore it is in the best interest of the Government to purchase the Secure Elements C5 tool as it’s the only current available product. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08/13/2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 E. Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385.  Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation issue date TBD and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor?s personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract is scheduled to include a projected sixty-day phase-in period (1 Aug 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.     The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.     
Current technical data for this requirement will be posted on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website at https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=FA2517-06-R-8002 and also available on FedBizOps as zip files.  Currently, this is the only technical data available for this effort and no Air Force Technical Orders or Instructions are available for this project. There is a VENDOR USER GUIDE available on the FedTeDS website.  The government request interested parties to review the technical information on FedTeds and provide us with opinions whether there is adequate information available to develop and submit a proposal for this requirement. 
It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.     As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.                                                                                     
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.                             
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

Since the area on the interior of the berm is very inaccessible to vehicular application methods, aerial application is preferred and it will incorporate GPS assisted swath placement.  The application equipment will provide GPS guidance information to be extracted into GIS and analyzed.  The contractor will need to develop a Flight Plan and obtain approval from Base Operations and Air Traffic Control.  Any equipment, whether aerial or ground, will be transported in accordance with Florida DOT regulations.  Areas on the outside of the berm, including the exterior face and the base, will be treated with hand held equipment or vehicle mounted units.  GPS data will be generated for these areas as well.  The contractor will support this SOW by providing a post-herbicide application assessment up to two times per year and continuing for up to two years following application to ensure that the treatment is efficacious and meets the goals and objectives set forth.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Firms responding to this announcement should email Ms. Rael with their company name, CAGE code, point of contact, company address and indicate whether thay are a small business, 8(a) concern, vetern-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business or woman-owned small business.

<DESC>RFI #2007-1276 ABMIW, Modification #2. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1.  I understand this is only an RFI, but I was wondering if there is a contractor currently fulfilling this service or if this is a new requirement.  If there is a contractor, are you able to provide the name, number, award/expiration date, and value?  Answer:  This is a new requirement. 2.  It was difficult to tell from the RFI alone what to expect in terms of length of content. The seven questions indicate brevity, but it's hard to understand whether in this instance you expect many pages or mostly summary information to estimate the dem and for funding, as in our response.    Answer:  There is no page limit or required format for responses. 3.  Reference the General Information Section of the RFI Web Page on FedBizOpps - What are the Original and Current Response Dates of Mar 31, 2008?   My understanding is that the written RFI Submittal is due no later than July 30, 2007 at 1:00pm. Answer:  The due date for responses to the RFI was extended from July 30, 2007 to August 3, 2007 (1:00 p.m.) with Mod. #1 to the RFI.  The date of March 31, 2008 is the Archive date for Fedbizopps posting only.   4.  Is this an R&D effort or is the customer expecting a solution that is available off-the-shelf? Answer:  The Government is interested in adapting existing software to support various studies.  However, the Government is also interested in the ability to join future R&D efforts.  5.  Are you requesting a single solution--one product that covers all the requirements--or a number of solutions that address all the requirements? Answer:  Either a single solution or several solutions that can be used together to support studies would be considered. 6.  What is the anticipated period of performance? Answer:  To be determined (TBD). 7.  In the RFI is this bit:          [(3) Response time is critical as many of the items will be considered                  critical to the Warfighter and requires short turnaround times.] Do you mean that the system itself must return results quickly, or are you referring to existing technology and that it must be ready for quick deployment? Answer:  The system itself must return results quickly and also must be ready for quick deployment. 8.  Also, in a few places you mention [AI Modules], as in:      [One deliverable will be an integration toolkit in which AI modules may be plugged in...]  What do you consider AI modules in this RFI, as distinct from agent-based solutions? Answer:   The quote is best read concentrating on the [ors.]  The point is that the Government requires the modeler operating the simulation to be able to port in or out data to other simulations/tools/modules.  This could be an AI module or other modules/ methods.   9.  The RFI implies that the developer of the model would in fact be just that - the [developer] - and not necessarily the actual research facility doing the [analysis] of the problem; the model is presumably to be run by PA&E staff.  Is this correct? Answer:  The model would be used by PA&E and its analytic partners, including the Joint Staff and the Services.  The intent is for Government analysts to run the model at government facilities as they do now for conventional combat models such as Synthetic  Theatre Operations Research Model (STORM) and Joint Integrated Campaign Model (JICM).  There are various possible mixes of developers vs. government effort possible--The model might be fully operable by the government or might be operable after a specific  data build by the contractor prior to each study.  There is also the possibility of short-term around time due to a critical need. 10.  While the features of the model are spelled out - in great detail - all details regarding the actual [problem] (or scenarios), as well as guidance on the context in which the problem(s)/scenarios are to be explored are missing. While I can understand, in the interests of classification, that certain aspects of this [problem space]

<DESC>All future information concerning this requirement will be posted on ASFI/Fedbizopps.must remain undefined, as an operations research analyst who develops models for a living, I can attest to the fact that is nearly impossible to concei ve of a design for a model without knowing something (actually, to considerable depth) of the intended problem space. Answer:  This model should be able to help predict trends contributing to the emergence and development of insurgency during peace-keeping operations and post combat stability operations.    11.  With regard to the [details] of the model, at least as conceived/defined in the RFI.  Many items on this list (ex: [incorporate the influence, based on social theories agreed upon with the government, of infrastructure, economic, and practical constra ints and opportunities on behavior]) arguably can define - *by themselves alone * - viable backbones of an interesting *basic research* effort; yet they are mentioned as but one item of many in a long list of what the project *expects* to be part of the mo del. Frankly, the list - collectively - appears to strongly over constrain the model. Given the enormous multidimensional space of variables involved, if all of these components are truly meant to be part of a model, I'd question the utility of such a model to meaningfully address significant issues. Thus my question: am I to interpret this list of model [features] as a literal snapshot of what the project is attempting to do with the model, or more as a list of [guidelines] that may/will change as the problem b ecomes better defined and the design process starts in earnest?  Please guidance on these concerns, or any additional specifics about the kinds of problems/scenarios to be explored, and toward what analytical end, that would help clarify my formal response  to the RFI. Answer:  This RFI is presenting a version of a tool that would be ideal to the Governments type of analysis.  The Government recognizes that it may not be possible to meet all of these criteria or that more advanced criteria may exist that we have no know ledge of. Nothing follows.

<CONTACT>James McLaughlin, Contract Specialist, Phone 719-556-3849, Fax 719-556-7396, Email james.mclaughlin@peterson.af.mil
<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541690 with an associated size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes a good portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<SUBJECT>70--Intent to Sole Source - PandoraSoftware SQL
<SOLNBR>VA-250-07-RQ-0083
<ARCHDATE>08132007
<CONTACT>Shirley Whitby Contract Specialist 937-262-5975
<DESC>This is a notice of intent of the Dayton VAMC Acquisition Group, Dayton, Ohio to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Pandora Data Systems for Pandora SQL system to convert data for Pyxis, Omnicell and Accudose ADM's to SQL databases for VISN 10 (Dayton, Chillicothe, Cleveland, and Cleveland).  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the agency requirements. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 4:00 p.m., July 20 2007.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notices is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. All inquiries must be submitted in writing with &quot;SQL Data System&quot; in the subject line; telephone inquiries will not be accepted, nor responses received after the close time/date. DAYTON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Medical Center 4100 West Third Street Dayton OH 45428 JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. JUSTIFICATION 1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity. The Dayton Department of Veterans Affairs is purchasing Pandora SQL Software for four locations in VISN 10.  2.  Nature/description of action. This action is a purchase order to obtain Pandora SQL databases for Pharmacy Services so that they will have the ability to have automated medication dispensing machines (ADS). 3.  Description of Supplies/Services. This software is to enable the Pharmacy Services in Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Chillicothe to supplement  software that are integral parts of Pyxis, Omnicell and Accuedose automated medication dispensing machines  Pandora software and SQL database will be installed onto each VA facility computer network and linked to the server that operates the respective Omnicell or Pyxis units. The software will copy data coming into the server into its SQL database, where it is retained. Data consists of medications and amounts removed from the machines,  date/time of removal, person removing, patient care area (machine location), patient for whom the medication is removed.    4.  Identification of Statutory Authority. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1),  FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications. Pandora SQL system is the only product that can meet the needs for controlled substance monitoring with several different automated dispensing machines (ADM's).  The pharmacies currently use Pyxis or Omincell automated dispensing machines (ADM's) to store and record use of medication.  Pandora SQL software utilizes the data collected by these machines specifically to detect potential diversion.  Neither Pysix nor Omnicell software has the capability to perform such analyses as expediently or well as Pandora.  It is the only system that provides such enhanced analysis.  Pandora is the only known system on the market that converts data for Pyxis, Omnicell and Accuedose ADMS's to SQL database, and is programmed to utilize long term utilization patterns to detect potential division of controlled substances and/or other medications at risk for division.   6.  Federal Business Opportunities - The acquisition was announced in the Federal Business Opportunities and no contractors' responded with their ability to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs needs for this requirement. 7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.  A price analysis was completed and the pricing was deemed fair and reasonable.  The analysis took into account similar software and also considered that the company gave the Government a 25% discount from the commercial list price.  A further discount was given based on VISN pricing rather than individual location pricing. 8.  Description of Market Survey.  GSA advantage and the internet were searched for other products that can perform the services needed.  The requirement was also posted in fedbizopps requesting contractor to notify the contracting office if they have the capabilities required.  Pandora was the only company that was able to meet the government needs.  9.  Any Other Supporting Data. N/A 10.	Listing of Interested Sources. N/A 11.	Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition. Under the present circumstances, there is no action needed regarding this short-term proposed contract. The VA will continue to try to find new sources that can supply the software that is needed for this acquisition.  This will be done by posting this intent to award which lets the public know we have a need.  Further announcement searching for sources will be done.  The marketplace will also be continued to search to find other software that will sufficie and other VAs will be contacted to see if they develop new sources. 12.  Certification: CONTRACTING OFFICER  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. _____/s/_____________________											__7/23/07_________ Shirley Whitby Dayton Contract Manager            	             										Date

<DESC>This amendment is issued to answer questions submitted 27 July 2007. 1.  Questions and answers. Question 1:  From conversation with representative of Teamsters Union Local 166, the Health and Welfare benefits are $860.00 per month per employee.  However, this amount is not contained in the collective Bargaining Agreement. 	Answer:  The current Collective Bargaining Agreement is in effect and will be used unless revised by the Union. Question 2:  Solicitation requirement that the offeror shall limit their unit and extended prices to two (2) decimal places (example: $158.03). For the CLINS where the unit price is based on square footage, two (2) decimal places can cause a significant ro unding difference between extended amount and calculated price from which the unit price is based. 	Answer:  Due to rounding issues in our system, it was decided to require the prices submitted by any offeror to round either up or down to two (2) decimal places.  Therefore, prices shall be submitted in accordance with solicitation. Question 3:  Will the Government provide the contract value for the current performance period under contract. 	Answer:  Previous contract Base and four (1-year) options amount:  $3,052,506.00. 		Interim contract (8 months) amount: $498,811.00 2.  The date for receipt of proposals remains the same as specified in Amendment 0001, dated 24 July 2007.

This procurement will be comp eted on a two step, technically acceptable, low price basis.  Bidders will submit a technical proposal and two bid samples to be evaluated on a test range to determine product technical acceptability.  The Government intends to invite those bidders deemed to have a technically acceptable product to participate in a reverse auction.  The resulting contract will be a five year Firm-Fixed price IDIQ contract with a maximum quantity of 3000 robotic systems, spare parts, operator and maintenance training, and va rious documentation support.   Delivery Order 0001 will be concurrently awarded and will consist of (101) robotic systems, which will satisfy the guaranteed minimum quantity of the above referenced contract.  Delivery Order 0001 will also include, (1) sess ion of Maintainer training, (1) session of Operator training, and (10) spare parts kits.  The spare parts kits will consist of all items necessary to produce a robotic system and will be supported by a Bill of Materials listing the bidders part numbers, O EM part numbers, and unit price for each item.  A spreadsheet will be delivered via E-mail to all auction participants prior to the start of the auction to facilitate bid submissions.  This spreadsheet will be in Microsoft Excel format and have parameters set to allow for range pricing at larger quantities and will be used to establish the ceiling amount of the resulting IDIQ contract and the pricing structure for future delivery orders.  Please ensure you review Clause 52.214-10 when establishing your aver age price.  Especially paragraph (e) referencing unbalanced pricing and the contracting officers recourse.      Description of Need: A Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) has been received by the RSJPO requesting accelerated procurement of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to be used for Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection and identification.  Th is contract effort addresses the need of United States military forces to acquire commercial off the shelf/non-developmental items (COTS/NDI) that can be immediately produced upon contract award.  The xBot, which is a generic name that will be used until c ontract award, consists of a remote controlled robotic platform, operator control unit (OCU), and a transportation case.   The selected robotic system and associated spare parts will be used in direct support of contingency operations Outside the Continent al United States (OCONUS).  Required capabilities include a small, wireless, remote controlled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) system platform that weighs 50 pounds or less excluding any external payloads, and an OCU that weighs 20 pounds or less.  Technical  acceptability will be measured using a Go/No-go technical acceptability matrix.

<DESC>Research and Development (R&D) sources are sought for the Sub-millimeter Wave Imaging Fuze Technology (SWIFT) Exploratory Development project which intends to develop and demonstrate a breadboard imaging fuze sensor.  The objective of this program will be to design an active imaging fuze sensor architecture that is nose and/or conformal mounted on a right circular cylinder weapon airframe whose diameter could range from 5 to 8 inches.  This fuze sensor is intended to detect airborne and surface targets of interest; determine the range, range rate, and location of the target with respect to the airframe?s coordinate system; and declare the aimpoint on the target for use by an electrically aimed kill mechanism.  The goals for this sensor are to detect the target, locate its centroid, and declare an aimpoint at sufficient distance for invoking the kill mechanism.  Although active radar components have been demonstrated up to 800 GHz, this effort intends to limit the choices of operating frequency to those that can be supported by commercially available test equipment.  The purpose of this sources sought is to determine what capabilities exist in Industry to design, fabricate and evaluate the SWIFT concept.  Technologies of interest include sources, modulators, mixers, antenna arrays, radar architectures, algorithms, clutter measurements, target measurements, synthetic scene generation software, etc; that could be used to realize the SWIFT concept.  Anticipated tasks of this effort are as follows:  concept refinement, concept simulation, breadboard fabrication, limited signature measurements, and limited dynamic field testing for simulation validation.  The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be 36 months. At this time we are requesting information packages from potential sources on their capability to perform design and development of this next generation active imaging fuze sensor concept. All responsible sources may submit a qualification package that will be considered by the agency.  Firms having applicable interest, capability, and background should submit particulars in accordance with Numbered Note 25 to AFRL/MNK, Attention: Carol Abbott, Building 13, 101 West Eglin  Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810, and reference MNK RFI 07-001.  Firms will be evaluated on their experience, personnel, and facilities.  Responses to this synopsis must be received within 45 days from the date of publication. Respondents to this notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Firms responding to this synopsis should state the size and/or category of their firm, as defined in FAR 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 541710 (500 people).

<DESC>Market Survey Description Market Survey for an Arctic Engine and Transmission Oil GENERAL INFORMATION: The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. §1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualif ying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:  1.Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.  2.In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below ). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.  3.The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.  4.Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginni ng of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.  5.In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.  6.The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude dis closure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without us ing support contractors consistent with the resources available.

<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541690 with an associated size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes a good portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<DESC>We have a requirement for upgrade of the installation base radio system (BRS). Fort Riley is looking for sources with capability to upgrade its M/A-COM ProVoice ®, trunking radio system to an APCO 25 compliant Trunking radio system consisting of a p rimary site and 2 new sites. The Primary site currently consists of 7 transmitters and will be expanded to a total of 14 operating in the 406 -420 M bandwidth. The Grant Ridge site will be a new 3 transmitter site utilizing an existing tower and communicat ions hut. The Range 54 site will be a new 3 transmitter site utilizing an existing communications hut but requires the erection of a 100 transmitter tower.  Required APCOP25 Feature Support System Feature Set The system conversion shall maintain compliance with the following system level trunking features: Table 1 - System Level Features Supported Call Queuing: channels are assigned in the order requests are received, with higher priority traffic placed before lower priority traffic. Late Entry (Continuous Assignment Updates): the control channel provides regular updates of calls active on the various working channels. Unit Validation (Access Control): permission to transmit on a working channel can be restricted to predetermined list of unit IDs (UIDs)  Call Validation By Group: calling radios may be validated by talkgroup, as well as UID, and denied access if no other active users of that talkgroup are registered. Unit Deregistration: units are deregistered from a site following a predetermined period of inactivity or following registration at another site. Individual (Private) Call: two radios may communicate privately, if the radio is programmed to allow this activity.   Telephone Interconnect:  radios may directly place telephone calls using the systems central telephone interconnect capability, if the radio is programmed to allow this activity.  Other users may place calls through the dispatch consoles Call Director Pat ch facility.   Out of Range Tone: the radio will emit an out-of-range tone when transmission is attempted outside the service area of the radio.  Talk Prohibit Tone: the radio will emit a call-denied tone when service is denied by the system infrastructure. Transmit prompt tone: the radio will emit a go-ahead tone when a channel is granted. Busy Queuing and Callback: if a call request is placed while all working channels are busy, the radio will emit a call-queued tone.  Once a channel is available, a go-ahead tone is emitted, and the call proceeds. Recent User Priority: priority will be elevated for users of talkgroups engaged in recent transmissions. Multiple Priority Levels: the system will assign calls based on a 10-level priority system, with additional levels assigned to recent calls and special calls such as emergency calls. Access Control: permission to transmit on a working channel can be restricted to predetermined list of unit Ids (UIDs)  Fast Channel Access: typical access times are less than 150ms for unqueued calls. Transmission and Message Trunking: either transmission or message trunking may be used.  Emergency calls are always message trunked to assure continuity of these high priority calls. 9600 Baud On All Channels: 9600 baud signaling is used for both working and control channels. Convert to Callee: if more than one user attempts to talk on the same talkgroup, the first or highest priority use will be assigned the call and all others will be converted to callees. Group Scan & Priority Group Scan: all radios can be programmed to monitor several non-active talkgroups, with one being assigned as a priority group.   Caller ID Display: the ID of the calling radio is displayed on all receiving radios and dispatch consoles, and may be the actual UID or an assigned alphanumeric alias. SECTION 2.0 - SYSTEM UPGRADES AND CONVERSIONS RF Sites Current RF Site (BUILDING 5002 Main Trunking tower) The seven-channel ProVoice® system located at Building 5002 will require t he following upgrades or replacements.

Local or Remote Operation: System management terminals can be located and operated either locally or remotely from the master site. Unit ID Display: When the radio PTT is pressed, the unit ID displays on the management terminal. Emergency Alarms: When a radio sends an emergency alarm, it is displayed on the management terminal on a sub-system basis. Statistics Logging: Retains airtime usage reports for up to one year Database Snapshot: The system management terminal can generate reports from the database. Display: The radio will provide several forms of graphical representation for talkgroup, private and interconnect calls.   Custom Reports: The management terminal shall provide reports detailing airtime use by unit ID and talkgroup. Security Partitioning: Provide shared inter-agency partitions such that one agency can not access other agencies system information Dynamic Shared Services: Controls the max number of simultaneous and length of interconnect calls to ensure adequate voice channels for dispatch service. Alarm Outputs: Shall have the ability to give warning indications of minor and major system failures. Conventional Interface Stations (Interoperability) This feature is imbedded in the Interoperability Gateway (IG) subsystem of the NSS.  Current four-wire interfaces are duplicated in the IG, so all radios and attendant equipment are fully reusable. Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) and Rekeying (OTAR) Over The Air Programming OTAP The desired system shall utilize an OTAP platform that supports over the air reprogramming of radios.    Over The Air Re-keying OTAR The desired system shall utilize an OTAR platform that supports Re-keying radios. Dispatch Dispatch shall be supported by five dispatch consoles.  Each Console shall be a true VoIP node, with vocoded and encrypted calls arriving and departing the console in native format.  All vocoding and encryption/decryption will be performed directly in the console Dispatch Feature Set The desired APCO 25 conversion shall maintain compliance with the following dispatch features: Table 2  Dispatch Console Features Supported Recent User Priority: priority will be elevated for users of talkgroups engaged in recent transmissions.  This is a system-wide feature Radio to Telephone Patch: The dispatcher shall have the ability to connect a radio user with a telephone call for  a conversation.  Select radios will be able to connect directly. Radio Patch: The dispatcher shall have the ability to connect two radios for a conversation. Simulselect and Patch (Multi-Select): The dispatcher shall have the ability to temporarily merge or patch multiple talkgroups into one voice channel.  The dispatcher can merge talkgroups for a single call or on a more permanent basis. Conventional (mutual-aid) Interfaces: The dispatcher shall have the ability to permanently patch talkgroups with conventional channels for mutual aid.   Logging Recorder Interface: A port to connect a logging recorder to record talkgroup audio traffic.  The logging recorder will be connected to the Interoperability Gateway.   NOTE: This function is also supportable through a dedicated trunked logging recorder interface from the NSS.  This is the preferred logging recorder option, since all Fort radio and emergency telephone traffic can be readily recorded and managed by a singl e trunked logging recorder.  If desired, a trunked logging solution will be provided. Emergency Alarm: On all handheld radios operating within the system, the user shall have the ability to send an alarm to the Dispatch Console. Unit ID Display: The dispatcher shall have the ability to display the radio ID using a voice channel. Aliasing: The dispatcher shall have the ability to display the user-friendly name for a talkgroup or a radio ID(s) Dispatch Consoles  The desired consoles must provide all the same functionality provided by the current Maestro NT®, with the added benefit of IP connectivity.   Each console will be equipped in the same manner as the current Maestro® console it replaces. Each will include a 17 monitor, desk microphone, two desktop speakers, a custom keyboard, and mouse. The currently installed ten minute Uninterruptible Power Sup plies (UPS) may be reused.  Each console must be supplied with Call Director functionality which provides the capability for telephone interconnection through the consoles, by using the central telephone capability of an Interoperability Gateway. Headset jacks must be provided to support the RF dispatch headsets currently in use.  User Equipment All M/A-Com 7100ip series radios purchased on the original and subsequent Fort Riley contracts are fully compatible with APCO25 Compliant systems.  Radios will require new software and reprogramming.  The following features must be added to each radio, and  the radios reprogrammed: APCO 25 Trunking  AES encryption, with FIPS-140 certification  Over The Air Re-keying (OTAR)  If the vendor makes the determination that their system cannot support a full feature set with the existing radios and Mobile units currently in use at Ft. Riley, then their capability statement shall also include the following: 1500 Handheld IP Capable units 150 Mobile units You shall have the capability to complete terminal upgrades, handheld reprogramming and Mobile reprogramming/ installation.  SECTION 3.0 - IMPLEMENTATION Frequency Licensing Current Fort Riley frequencies will be reused and additional in-band frequencies added, unless Fort Riley decides to utilize the dedicated DoD band from 380-399.9 MHz.  The decision to utilize this band will not affect the current 7100 series radios, which  operate from 380 MHz through 430 MHz.  Use of the dedicated 380-399.9 MHz DoD band may offer Fort Riley more options for expansion and frequency selection in the future.  If authorized, sites in both bands can be used. Licenses and Permits Fort Riley will be responsible for all permitting and licensing. Site Development Fort Riley will be responsible for providing all site infrastructure including, but not limited to, towers, new shelters, site grounding and generators to support the new equipment.  Vendor will have the capability to furnish and install the equipmen, incl uding UPSs and ice bridges at all three transmit sites and a new 100 guyed tower at Range 54.  All vendor-provide d equipment will be grounded to the GFE grounding systems. Coverage Description RF coverage provided by the new radio site will be similar to that provided by the existing system.  The proposed two new sites will provide additional coverage not currently supported, expanding the coverage footprint.  Coverage maps will be provided upon  request.  Interoperability Interoperability must be provided by an interoperability gateway device using the current 4-wire connection devices.  Functionality must be comparable to that currently offered, but may differ in operation.   SECTION 4.0 - SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND REDUNDANCY Fault tolerance and reliability are paramount and expected uptimes should approach an industry standard of 99.999% uptime.  Systems should incorporate redundant architecture and operating methods.  A system with the added benefit of IP infrastructure, with  the inherent ability to route traffic around circuit failures is preferred.  Additional network connections may be easily added at any time to gain this benefit. Fort Riley Responsibilities Information Assurance Certification Fort Riley will be responsible for all Information Assurance and other government mandated system certifications.  Vendor will have the capability to  provide a fully configured, APCO 25 compliant, trunked radio system that will include all of the Informat ion Assurance upgrades. Vendor must have the capability to support the system fully in this configuration, and have the capability to provide additional Information Assurance support, as well as security updates upon delivery of the system.   Information Assurance (IA) guidelines and security controls as specified in federal law (e.g., Federal Information Security Management Act [FISMA]), Department of Defense (DoD) policy (e.g., DoDI 8500.2, DoDI 5200.40), and Army Regulations (e.g., AR 25-2) must be adhered to and incorporated into the design of the system.  Industry best practices and Defense in Depth will be utilized to create a layered security design that includes technical and procedural elements. In this context, Defense in Depth is the application of multiple computer security techniques in products f rom multiple vendors to mitigate the risk of any one defense being compromised or circumvented.  A key element to the vendors technical capability will be the application of guidance from the appropriate DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG s) in the system design, implementation and operations and maintenance (O&M) of their products.  The vendor must have the capability to develop and implement processes to apply system security and hardening to their standard products, and the capability to implement their standard security controls to the Fort Riley system, providing a more robust sol ution, with the goal of achieving Authority to Operate under the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP).   SECTION 6.0 - SCHEDULE Fort Riley is currently positioned to begin implementation of this system at the time of contract release at the Main (Building 5002) and Grant Ridge sites. There will be approximately a 6-9 month lead time requirement for the installation of the communica tions shelter at Range 52 as it is being installed as part of a parallel project and not yet available for use.

<DESC>Sources Sought No. W912HY-07-S-0017 Project Title:  Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, Texas, Rehabilitate East and West Locks in Matagorda County, Texas. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District has a requirement for the above subject.  This is not a Solicitation Announcement and is no t a Request for Proposal and does not obligate the Government to any contract award. The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified Small Business Administration (SBA), Certified 8(a) Small Busine ss, Hubzone Small Business, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 237990.  The Small Business Size Standard is $31.0 Million.  To make an appropriate acquisition decision  for the above project, the Government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis.  The order of magnitude for this effort is $1 Million to $5 Million. Project Information: The work consists of the contractor shall provide all plant, labor, equipme nt and materials to Rehabilitate Sector Gates. After pressing the upper and lower pins and bushings out of the hinges, the contractor has to transport the sector back to its installed location where he will install new upper and lower pins and bushings and  then connect and align the gates drive mechanisms. The work will be conducted in a manner so as to obstruct navigation as little as possible, and traffic will be stopped for a maximum period of 12 hours each day before the waterway is opened back up to a llow un-restricted flow of traffic for a period of not less than 12 hours. If the level of the Colorado River rises and currents increase to the point where tows cannot safely cross the river and the lock is not operational, marine barge industry will have  no choice but to wait until the river goes down. Such a move would cripple barge service to and from major petro-chemical and other facilities along the Texas Coast. Emergency Reinstallation and Removal of Sector Gates. In the event of heavy rains or anti cipated floods on the Colorado River, the contractor shall be prepared to put the sectors back into service within 48 hours after it is so directed. The work includes the removal of the recess fenders, reinstallation of sectors with or without seals but wi th a minimum of three complete lines of fenders, restoring the sectors to normal operating conditions for the duration of flood, then removing the sectors and giving each a thorough wash down with fresh water before resuming the work to be done. The cathod ic protection system need not be installed during emergency conditions. The contractor shall complete the entire work and ready for use not later than 365 calendar days after acknowledgement of Notice to Proceed. This work will be performed on Government p roperty; therefore, the contractor shall be required to provide insurance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 28.307-2, Liability.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Rapid Attack Identification, Detection, and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Block 20 Program
<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) will be conducting an Industry Day relating to the Rapid Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Block 20 program (RB-20). The RB-20 Industry Day is scheduled for Wednesday, 29 August 2007 from 0800 - 1630 at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245. At this Industry Day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the current status, goals and potential strategies for requirements development, prototyping and acquiring of the RB-20 system. The Program Office?s goal is to maximize industry participation and visibility into the requirements development activities.  

As funded in the Future Year Defense Program (FYDP), RB-20 is currently in its Concept Development Phase. The overall program objective is to provide Defensive Counterspace (DCS) situation awareness of attacks (e.g. on-orbit or other) designed to deny or disrupt one or more U.S. space asset(s). The RB-20 system will encompass the full spectrum of inputs from intelligence reporting and forecasting to direct technical "feeds" from highly varied space and other assets. From these inputs, the RB-20 system will provide DCS situation awareness, indicate, characterize, and attribute space asset attacks and provide options for countering and responding to the exposed threat(s). RAIDRS Block 20 will be acquired in an evolutionary acquisition approach where the end-state described above will be the guidepost for technology, operational, and integration efforts leading to the comprehensive DCS situation awareness capability. The Preliminary Design Phase of RB-20 is planned to begin in Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.  

SYSW has engaged Johns Hopkins University?s Advanced Physics Laboratory (APL) in FY 2007 to assist with requirements development and rapid prototyping. The focus of this effort will be to (1) analyze and propose system-level requirements based on the draft Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and draft Enabling Concept (EC) and (2) document findings as inputs to the draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and to use rapid prototyping to assist in requirements development. 

Responses from small business, and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. 

Companies interested in attending this Industry Day must RSVP with Elaine Gehr, maximum of 3 people per company. Attendees must be U.S. citizens and must possess a DoD SECRET security clearance to attend this Industry Day. Use JPAS for Visit Certifications, SMO Code:  SYS Wing (to validate citizenship and clearance) Address: SYSW/AS 483 N.

In accordance with FAR 19.5 this action is reserved exclusively for small business concerns.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC  28516 intends to purchase on a firm fixed price purchase order the following items:  

Item 0001:  Quantity of five (5), Satellite tags with the following salient characteristics:  In order to obtain migration and location data on sea turtles, we want to attach satellite tags to the carapace of loggerhead sea turtles.  As technology has improved over the years, the ability to obtain more accurate location data has also improved.  Several companies are now manufacturing GPS satellite tags which can provide researchers with the most accurate location data there is.  However, as sea turtles can spend as little as a few seconds on the surface, we are in need of a GPS satellite tag that can acquire a highly accurate GPS locations in less than 1 second.  We need a GPS receiver peripheral that has been designed specifically to address the problems faced with traditional GPS receivers in a marine environment.  Wave wash, submersion, and poor antenna orientation are all problems that can prevent a traditional GPS receiver from maintaining signal lock and thus provide location information.  Consequently GPS receiver deployment on free ranging marine animals is rarely successful. We need a satellite tag that employs signal processing techniques to overcome these limitations, allowing it to successfully operate in the challenging marine environment.  We must also be able to program these tags in our lab, just prior to deployment rather than having them programmed by the manufacturer.

Item 0002:  Quantity of thirteen (13) Satellite tags with the following salient characteristics:  In order to accurately characterize the time that sea turtles spend on the surface of the water, along with the temperature of the water in which they are swimming, we want to attach other satellite tags to loggerhead sea turtles.  For this purpose, we need a satellite tag with sensors that will record water temperatures from 0?? - 40?? C, that will record the amount of time that the sea turtle spends on the surface (i.e., haulout time), that has a depth sensor with a minimum resolution of 1 meter, and that has a light sensor which can provide additional information as to whether the turtle is on or close to the surface of the water or not.  We must also be able to program these tags in our lab, just prior to deployment rather than having them programmed by the manufacturer.

Item 0003:  Shipping charges,
Item 0004:  Insurance,
Item 0005  Dangerous Goods charge,

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

FA/18 FLIGHT CREW SUPPORT AS PER ATTACHED SOW.
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
FOR FLEET READINESS CENTER SOUTHEAST
FLIGHT CREW SUPPORT SERVICES


1.0. INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE) performs Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) of existing aviation end items, systems, and components and manufacturing of items and component parts not otherwise available. This includes modernization, conversion, in-service repair, disassembly, and all other categories of aircraft DLM.  The types of aircraft and associated aircraft components requiring DLM include, but are not limited to, the following: EA6B, F/A-18, H-60, P-3, E-2, C-2 and S-3. 

1.2.  When all work on an aircraft, its engine(s), components, etc. has been completed, the aircraft must undergo a functional check flight (FCF).  A FCF determines whether an aircraft airframe, engine or engines, accessories, or equipment is functioning according to established standards while the aircraft operates in its intended environment. The FCF is performed when it is not possible to determine proper operation by a ground check. 

1.3.  Timely completion of FCFs are critical in order to return the aircraft to the Fleet following DLM.  FCFs are typically performed by military personnel, trained and qualified on particular aircraft, stationed at or on temporary additional duty at FRCSE.  Government civil service personnel are not trained nor qualified for flight of military aircraft.  At times, military personnel are not available to perform FCFs.  This results in unacceptable delays in return of the aircraft to the fleet.  In order to remedy this problem, the FRCSE requires contractor support to accomplish timely FCFs.  Additionally, contractor support may be required to accomplish ferry flights to pick up or deliver aircraft prior to or following DLM. 


2.0. SCOPE

2.1.  The contractor shall provide flight crew services to augment military personnel in support of DLM for F/A-18 aircraft.

The DOHLS shall operate over multiple frequencies, however, the Government anticipates that system performance at 25kHz is the most common and most critical level.  Delivery of the DOHLS will include the Laser, the power supply, the Laser Control / Operating Software (LC/OS), spare parts, as-built drawings, user manual package, and installation on-site at NASA Glenn Research Center.	 The following EIGHT categories constitute the Government’s MINIMUM REQUIREMENT for the DOHLS.	 [Please note the opportunity to exercise a request for a VARIANCE.] 1.  LASER / POWER SUPPLY  The DOHLS shall incorporate a dual oscillator head design, such that each oscillator head can be independently triggered.  The delay adjustment between oscillator head outputs shall be continuously adjustable from 0 to ½ of the laser repetition rate with at least 15 nanosecond accuracy when externally triggered by the same trigger pulse.  Both  oscillator heads and all beam combining, wavelength separation optics shall be contained in a single laser housing with dimensions specified below.   The minimally acceptable Laser beam output from EACH oscillator head (at 25kHz operation) shall be: Pulse length(Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) shall not exceed 120 nanoseconds 	Beam Diameter exiting laser shall not exceed 2.0 mm (no telescope optics shall be used) 	Shall have a beam quality of M-“squared”  less than 16 	Shall have a beam pointing stability of better than 40 microradians 	Shall have a pulse energy of at least 5 mJ from each laser head Total average power shall be 125 W from each laser head The minimally acceptable pulse energy from EACH oscillator head (over the range of operating frequencies) shall be: 11 mJ at 6 kHz operation, with less than 100 ns pulse width, M-“squared”  less than 16 10 mJ at 10 kHz operation, with less than 110 ns pulse width, M-“squared”  less than 16 	  5 mJ at 25 kHz operation, with less than 120 ns pulse width, M-“squared”  less than 16 The DOHLS power requirements shall not exceed 220VAC, single-phase 20 Amp, 60 Hz service per head. The DOHLS shall require external water cooling.  The water cooling flow rate requirement shall not exceed 6 gpm at 15-100 psi.  The cooling water temperature shall be within the range of 5C - 25C.   Physical size: The combined dual oscillator head (with beam combining optics) dimensions shall not exceed: 1300Lx300Wx250H mm  	DOHLS power supply dimensions shall not exceed:  820L x533Wx1020H mm and shall be equipped with casters for transport Each oscillator head’s weight shall not exceed 50 Kg.  The combined laser head (that is, both oscillators and all beam combining optics) shall not exceed 110 Kg. The DOHLS power supply weight shall not exceed 125 Kg each. The DOHLS shall hold the stated output power and the beam quality specifications at 75F ambient temperature. The DOHLS shall accept a continuity closure interface for interlock purposes.  Each of the  DOHLS power supply units shall be equipped with an external interlock connecter with a BNC style connector.	The external interlock signal shall be supplied by NASA to the DOHLS using a contact closure relay.  Contact closure on the interlock signal line shall energize the internal laser interlock.	An open circuit on the interlock connector shall cause the intra-cavity to close in each oscillator head. The DOHLS shall accept an external TTL trigger pulse for each laser power supply.  The external TTL trigger pulse shall initiate laser output (firing the laser Q-switch) upon the receipt of each TTL pulse.	The time delay from the receipt of the external trigger pulse until laser output (defined here as latency) shall not exceed 5 microseconds and the difference in latency between each oscillator head shall not exceed 200 nanoseconds.  2.  USER MANUAL PACKAGE The Contractor shall provide a User Manual Package for both the DOHLS and the LC/OS.  The User Manual shall include step-by-step instructions regarding the manual operation/setting of the flashlamp energy of the laser when operating below 6 kHz (if not already compensated in the LC/OS). 3.  AS-BUILT OPTICAL LAYOUT DRAWING The Contractor shall provide a complete As-Built Optical Layout Drawing of the DOHLS.	 An As-Built Drawing is a pre-construction blueprint/prototype/production drawing that has been “marked-up” to reflect any adjustments made to the design during the fabrication of the delivered DOHLS.  In addition, any “lessons learned” during the fabrication process (that are not reflected on the As-Built Drawing) shall be addressed in the User’s Manual Package.  The Contractor may imprint its name/logo on the document(s).	The Contractor shall deliver the Original As-Built Drawing (that is, the actual “marked-up” pre-construction drawing), not a reproduction.	A printable/reproducible electronic copy may also be provided, at the Contractor’s discretion.  4.  INSTALLATION The Contractor shall install the DOHLS and the LC/OS at GRC upon delivery (FOB DESTINATION).  Acceptance of the DOHLS and the LC/OS will occur after satisfactory delivery, installation, and test. 5.  SPARE PARTS The Contractor shall also deliver the following spare parts: •	Two (2) Deionized water filters for the cooling group (in addition to the two installed in the DOHLS cooling group). •	One (1) LBO crystal (in addition to the two LBO crystals installed in the DOHLS) 6.  OUTPUT The DOHLS shall produce collinear output beams at 532 nm wavelength.  Laser beams shall be frequency doubled before combining. Output from the dual oscillator heads shall be combined into a single coaxial beam, exiting the DOHLS housing through a single port.  At least 99% of the 1064 nm light shall be removed from the exit beam (only 532 nm output). Output power stability shall be no more than 3% rms at 25 kHz operating point. Output from the oscillator heads shall be orthogonally polarized, and have a polarization ratio of at least 100:1. 7.  OPERATION The DOHLS shall be remotely operated, via:  (1) a USB, (2) a Firewire,	or (3) an RS-232 port interface to a computer.   The DOHLS shall operate from 6 kHz up to 25 kHz, however, the design operating point shall be 25 kHz. The DOHLS shall operate via either internal trigger, or via an externally supplied TTL level trigger signal.  A single TTL trigger pulse shall be required for each oscillator head to initiate the Q-Switch operation.  The change from internal to external triggering shall be via a switch on the laser power supply unit.  The umbilical cable from the laser power supply to each of the oscillator heads shall be at least 4 m in length. Timing jitter from receipt of external laser trigger to laser emission shall not exceed 15 nanoseconds 8.  LASER CONTROL / OPERATING SOFTWARE	(LC/OS) The Contractor shall provide Windows XP operating system Laser Control / Operating Software (LC/OS), which shall control the DOHLS operation via the interface port.  The LC/OS shall set laser output power (via tube current), repetition rate, intra-cavity shutter and output shutter.  The LC/OS shall shutdown the DOHLS if an error condition occurs.  “Shutdown” is defined as closing the intra-cavity shutter and decreasing laser flashlamp current to the minimum value. The DOHLS shall be equipped with high speed exit port shutters on each laser head to block laser emission.  The shutters shall have a maximum open/close time of 20 ms.  The shutters shall be external to the laser cavities, downstream of the LBO frequency doubling crystals – such that the shutter does not stop lasing when the shutter is closed.  Instead, the shutter uses a mirror to direct the 532 nm beam into a water cooled beam dump inside the laser head.  The shutters shall be operable either via the LC/OS, or by an externally supplied TTL level trigger pulses to each oscillator head through BNC style connectors on each laser head. VARIANCES The Eight categories of the Specifications identify the Government’s Minimum Requirement.  However, the Government recognizes that the DOHLS herein described is a complex and possibly unique piece of equipment, and it will most likely be supplied via a commercial-off-the-shelf  product that has undergone some customization.  In order to assure the widest level of competition (which is expected to yield the best product and the best price/value), the Government is amenable to relaxing some of its requirements.  Consequently, the Government reserves the right to approve the following variances on a case-by-case basis, without further notice to competitors:      •	Cooling Water Temperature may vary outside the 5C - 25C range. •	Laser input power may exceed 208 VAC single phase, 20 amps. •	Laser pulse energies may fall below 5 mJ pulse at 25 kHz operation •	Laser pulse width may exceed 120 ns at 25 kHz operation IF AN OFFEROR WISHES TO SEEK A VARIANCE, the Offer should:  (1) identify the variance/amount, and (2) state the impact (cost/schedule/etc.) of bringing the DOHLS into full compliance with the Specification (or, state that full compliance is not possible).  It is not necessary to obtain a Variance prior to submitting an Offer. [END SPECIFICATIONS] All contractual and technical questions must be in writing (e-mail or fax) to Linda Kendrick not later than  August 10, 2007.  Telephone questions will not be accepted. SOURCE SELECTION Selection and award will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2. The Specifications constitute the Government’s MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.   Every proposed DOHLS will be evaluated at the performance level of 25kHz to determine whether the minimum requirements have been met.  In the event that the Government receives competing offers for more than one minimally acceptable DOHLS, the Government will consider the following items to be of Significant Value and may base its selection on a tradeoff between Lowest Price and Best Value.	 •	A One-Year no-cost Warranty is desirable.  The Terms and Conditions of a parts/labor warranty will be considered. •	Prompt Delivery and quick installation are desirable.  Delivery/Installation schedule/terms will be considered.  •	An oscillator head cooling loop water resitivity readout for monitoring laser head cooling water resitivity is desirable.  The Terms/Conditions for inclusion of the readout will be considered. •	Higher mJ levels of pulse energy are desirable.   •	Higher Total Average Power from each oscillator head is desirable. •	Shorter pulse length is desirable. •	Smaller Beam Diameter is desirable. •	Improvement of Beam Quality is desirable. •	Better Beam Pointing Stability is desirable. •	Smaller overall system size is desirable. •	Smaller overall system weight is desirable. •	Lower overall DOHLS power consumption requirements are desirable. •	Lower overall DOHLS cooling requirements are desirable. •	Inclusion of a digital delay pulse generator for synchronizing laser output timing is desirable.  If a digital delay pulse generator is included, it shall accept an external trigger input and it shall provide a TTL output synchronization pulse.   •	USB Interface is more desirable than either the firewire or RS-232 port interface. •	Overall performance of the DOHLS at frequencies other than 25 kHz will be considered. It is critical that offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer.  (SEE FAR 52.212-1(b)).	  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the following Internet site for the release of solicitation amendments (if any): http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22	 .  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this combination synopsis/solicitation and amendments (if any).

Requesting bids for the drilling of 13 shallow (less than 40', quote for 520 total linear feet) and 4 deep wells (less than 100', quote for 400 total linear feet) in the Jobos Bay region, Salinas and Guayama Municipalities, of Puerto Rico.  The shallow wells will be located in close proximity to one another (1 sq. mile) while the 4 deep wells will spaced approximately 1 mile apart along a transect extending northward from Jobos Bay.  
The approximate location for the network of shallow wells will be 17? 57' N to 17? 59' N and 66? 16 W.  Approximate depth to water is 5' to 15' to the south and 30' to 60' to the north.  Exact locations of these wells, as well as the deep wells, is dependent upon landowner cooperation and will be determined at a later date.
Shallow Wells  
The 13 shallow wells will be drilled into the surficial aquifer at anticipated depths of 20 to 40'.  All wells will be drilled 10' below the average water table elevation.  The anticipated drilling materials are alluvial fan-delta deposits.
Deep Wells
The 4 deeper wells will be drilled through the surficial aquifer, into the deeper regional aquifer with anticipated depths of 100'.  All wells will be drilled 10' below the average water table elevation.  The actual depth will vary with proximity to the Bay.  Where the surficial aquifer is separated from the deeper aquifers, screened intervals will be installed into the deeper aquifer separating flow between the aquifers.  Where no aquifer separation exists, wells will be only required to sample from the top of the surficial aquifer.  The anticipated drilling materials are primarily the alluvial fan-delta deposits, but some drilling into the sedimentary and volcanic rocks depending upon the location.
Well Construction
1.  All wells will be constructed with threaded 2.0" Schedule 40 PVC monitoring pipe with threaded caps at the surface and pointed plugs on the bottom.
2. Wells will be constructed with 10' of slotted screen pipe, with a slot size of 0.010".
3.  The annulus around the screened interval will be packed with 'Ottawa sand" or equivalent.  Above the screen the annulus around the well casing will be filled to approximately 5' below the soil surface with drilling cuttings.  A bentonite clay seal will be installed to a minimum depth of 1'.
4.  A shallow concrete plug will be installed around the surface of the well that will secure a metal water-box cap that is tamper proof and lockable.
5.  All wells will be cut off within 2" of the ground surface.
6.  All wells will be developed following drilling.
Lithographic Descriptions  

Stratigraphic geologic samples will be collected at 2' intervals for four of the shallow wells for physical inspection and testing by the SEWRL.  General lithographic descriptions of the drilling material will be required for four of the 13 shallow wells and for all of the deeper wells.  At the completion of well installation, a written report documenting the lithographic descriptions with depth will be expect for each of the eight wells characterized and an installation sketch will be required.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

Background:
The Center of Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates a multi-user facility that provides hands-on access to state-of-the-art Nanofabrication equipment and processes to researchers of all levels of knowledge from novice to expert and from both inside and outside NIST. The tools within the facility are used by the researchers on a pay-by-use basis. 

Currently the CNST requires an atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool for depositing thin films. This tool is different from the conventional physical and chemical vapor deposition tools the CNST has now. ALD is a self-limiting process, which only deposit one atomic layer at one time. The film coating is based on alternating saturative surface reactions. Based on the nature of the ALD process, the user can make new materials by controlling layer atoms, achieve ultra-thin and pin-hole free film, can control the film thickness precisely and can coat thin films on 3D nano-structures conformally. CNST will be using this ALD tool to provide the users with a variety of applications, from material research to thin film coating and device fabrication. Thus, this ALD tool is required to be able to coat a large variety of materials on different substrates of different shapes, sizes, and thicknesses.  Broad precursor coverage, flexible process adjustment (temperature, pressure, power etc.) accurate precursor dose control, good coating uniformity and conformity and adequate process monitoring are the basic requirements for the ALD tool.

The following are the evaluation criteria.

1.  TECHNICAL

A.  Whether the quoted solution conforms to the requirements set forth in the descriptions outlined in this solicitation for Line Item Numbers 0001 through Line Item 0013. 
B.  If any subcontractor/partnering arrangement is proposed, the offeror should address the management and coordination of the work in conformance to the Waste Acceptance Guidelines for processing and disposal services for Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)and required certifications.

2.  Technical Factors will be evaluated using the following ratings:

EXCELLENT (E)-  The proposal demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The proposal has NO weaknesses.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds ALL requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.
	
GOOD (G)-  The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  Any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.

SATISFACTORY (S)- The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses.  The proposal has some weaknesses that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of meeting the requirements.

MARGINAL (M)- The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions with a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.

UNSATISFACTORY (U)- The proposal fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.

In case of the furnace being inoperable due to a  fault or part failure, the contractor shall arrange a cost free maintenance  visit within seven days of fault being reported.  Cost:  If all other factors are determined to be equal between multiple  vendors then cost will be used as the final determining factor. For evaluation purposes, the relative order of non-cost factors is as follows:  Technical performance is the most important criteria. Ease of operation is  significantly less important than technical, maintenance is significantly less  important than ease of operation, training is significantly less important  than maintenance, and service is significantly less important than training. The award will be made based on the best overall (i.e. best value) proposal  that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government with  appropriate consideration given to the non-cost factors and price. The  Government will weight any increase to technical rating against any additional  price to determine if parity of the relationships warrant the paying of  additional price for the higher rating. However, price may become more  signifigant in the event of rating competing proposals are closely grouped. The following adjectival ratings shall apply to all non-cost factors: Blue  (Outstanding) A proposal that satisfies all of the Governmentâ€™s  requirement with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and  shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant  strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses with an overall low degree of  the risk in meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements. Green  (Good) A proposal that satisfies all of the Governmentâ€™s requirements  wit adequate detail too indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an  understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or  numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall  low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements. Yellow  (Acceptable) A proposal that satisfies all if the Governmentâ€™s  requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of approach and shows  a minimal understanding of the problems, with a moderate to high degree in  meeting the Governments requirements. Orange  (Marginal)  A proposal that satisfies all of the Governmentâ€™s  requirements with minimum detail to indicate the feasibility of the approach  and shows a minimal understanding of the problem with and overall high degree  of risk in meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements. Red  (Unsatisfactory)  A proposal that contains a major error(s) of deficiency (s) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that  cannot be expected to meet the requirements of involves a very high risk and  none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  The relative importance of the non-cost factors is significantly more  important than cost.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding  the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option  prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise  furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified  in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by  either party. Before the offerâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may  accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations  after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is an amendment to a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Reference Request for Quotation No. 301817Q329 for RR3 Riprap to be delivered to Savanna, IL.  Paragraph (vii) regarding delivery is deleted and changed to read as follows: Delivery of the riprap shall be made F.O.B. Destination to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, Savanna District.  The delivery site is the Spring Lake Management Unit, located approximately two miles south of Savanna IL off of Hwy 84 and then two miles (gravel road) west of Hwy 84. The delivery site is a newly rehabilitated earthen levee, so delivery is dependent upon weather, i.e., wet conditions will delay delivery. The earthen levee is 12 feet wide, thus restricting the truck size to the delivery site, i.e., an 18 ton tandem truck load may be the maximum size that can maneuver due to the narrow access; there is not enough room on the levee for access by a semi-trailer. The levee is 3,200 lineal feet in length where the rock will be dumped. USFWS staff will spread the rock with heavy equipment as each load is dumped. Three trucks per hour are needed in order for the rock to be spread on the shoulder of the levee.  The riprap is to be delivered between the period of September 1, 2007 through September 30, 2007, as coordinated with the USFWS Savanna District Manager.

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING FAR PART 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES. 
***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 with size standard of $6.5 million. 
This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted basis.
Background

Although the deployment of biometric technologies such ads fingerprints is becoming more widespread , little attention is being paid to the human-computer interaction that such technologies  involve. The use of biometrics will be unfamiliar to many users, who will not understand the technology, nor be comfortable with using it. Sine user behavior can affect both throughputs of the system as well as the quality of the captured images, guidelines for developing interactions with biometric applications that increase throughput and image quality would be valuable to the biometric community. This would help them develop hardware, software, and interaction techniques that would produce good quality biometrics. Designs that help end users understand the biometric hardware and process for both the participant and the operator.
The Visualization and Usability Group within the Information Access Division of The Information Technology Laboratory at NIST has established a Biometrics Usability program and had identified a number of usability factors that require verification on larger data sets to identify operational parameters for fingerprint systems. 
The contractor must have a strong technical background in fingerprint analysis and matching and the mathematics that defines fingerprint matching algorithms. A strong background in statistics and hypothesis testing in the fingerprint environment and familiarity with the previous fingerprint studies in this area is also necessary, in addition to strong technical writing ability. NIST will provide biometric source materials to the Contractor including the datasets.

The required Contract line Items s (CLINS) are:
Line Item 0001: Contractor performance and completion of Statement of Work (SOW) requirements including travel cost (if any):
Quantity: 1;  unit: Job 

Statement of Work (SOW)
The Habituation Study NIST IR 7271 (http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/biousa/docs/WP302_theofanos/pdf demonstrated that feedback can cause major improvement in fingerprint image quality. The goats study (http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.03/pact/ir_7271.pdf)) demonstrated that frequent users of US-VISIT can usually provide matchable fingerprints. The study will test the hypothesis that the success of the Goats Study is caused by habituation.

The Contractor shall compare the match scores of each of the ten sets of fingerprints for the 6,000 subjects used in the goats study with subjects selected by the COTR with similar demographics with match scores form the NIST SDK tests. If the proposed hypothesis is true the match scores from the first use by Goats subjects should be similar to the SDK scores for users with similar demographics. This would explain the observations that repeat US-VISIT user have better image quality than first time users and should allow US-VISIT match thresholds to be modified to reduce false non-match failures for frequent users. It will also confirm the applicability of the Habituation study results to large scale operational fingerprint processing and demonstrate the importance of provided good user feedback to users of verification systems such as PIV.
The Contractor shall develop a report that describes the analysis and results of the two datasets including the mathematics and statistics that prove or disprove the described hypothesis.

The Contractor will need expertise in the following:
1. computer modeling
2. pattern recognition
3. conforming testing
4. statistical analysis of fingerprint image quality
5. biometric interoperability and accuracy testing
6. NIST/ANSI-ITL-2007 fingerprint data exchange standard
7. MINEX: performance and interoperability in INCIT 378 fingerprint templates
8. biometric data specification for personal identity verification, special publication 800-76
9. NIST software development kit testing of fingerprint matching
10. effect of image size and compression on one-to-one fingerprint matching.
11. NISAT fingerprint image quality algorithm
12. fingerprint technology evaluation 2003.     
13.matching performance for the US-VISIT-IDENT system 
14. NIST/ANSI-ITL-2000 fingerprint data exchange standard. 


*** Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria:  Quality of  proposed  technical approach for satisfying (SOW) requirements, Past Performance information and price.
- Past Performance Information

Background

Although the deployment of biometric technologies such ads fingerprints is becoming more widespread , little attention is being paid to the human-computer interaction that such technologies  involve. The use of biometrics will be unfamiliar to many users, who will not understand the technology, nor be comfortable with using it. Sine user behavior can affect both throughputs of the system as well as the quality of the captured images, guidelines for developing interactions with biometric applications that increase throughput and image quality would be valuable to the biometric community. This would help them develop hardware, software, and interaction techniques that would produce good quality biometrics. Designs that help end users understand the biometric hardware and process for both the participant and the operator.
The Visualization and Usability Group within the Information Access Division of The Information Technology Laboratory at NIST has established a Biometrics Usability program and had identified a number of usability factors that require verification on larger data sets to identify operational parameters for fingerprint systems. 
The contractor must have a strong technical background in fingerprint analysis and matching and the mathematics that defines fingerprint matching algorithms. A strong background in statistics and hypothesis testing in the fingerprint environment and familiarity with the previous fingerprint studies in this area is also necessary, in addition to strong technical writing ability. NIST will provide biometric source materials to the Contractor including the datasets.

The required Contract line Items s (CLINS) are:
Line Item 0001: Contractor performance and completion of Statement of Work (SOW) requirements including travel cost (if any):
Quantity: 1;  unit: Job 

Statement of Work (SOW)
The Habituation Study NIST IR 7271 (http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/biousa/docs/WP302_theofanos/pdf demonstrated that feedback can cause major improvement in fingerprint image quality. The goats study (http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.03/pact/ir_7271.pdf)) demonstrated that frequent users of US-VISIT can usually provide matchable fingerprints. The study will test the hypothesis that the success of the Goats Study is caused by habituation.

The Contractor shall compare the match scores of each of the ten sets of fingerprints for the 6,000 subjects used in the goats study with subjects selected by the COTR with similar demographics with match scores form the NIST SDK tests. If the proposed hypothesis is true the match scores from the first use by Goats subjects should be similar to the SDK scores for users with similar demographics. This would explain the observations that repeat US-VISIT user have better image quality than first time users and should allow US-VISIT match thresholds to be modified to reduce false non-match failures for frequent users. It will also confirm the applicability of the Habituation study results to large scale operational fingerprint processing and demonstrate the importance of provided good user feedback to users of verification systems such as PIV.
The Contractor shall develop a report that describes the analysis and results of the two datasets including the mathematics and statistics that prove or disprove the described hypothesis.

The Contractor will need expertise in the following:
1. computer modeling
2. pattern recognition
3. conforming testing
4. statistical analysis of fingerprint image quality
5. biometric interoperability and accuracy testing
6. NIST/ANSI-ITL-2007 fingerprint data exchange standard
7. MINEX: performance and interoperability in INCIT 378 fingerprint templates
8. biometric data specification for personal identity verification, special publication 800-76
9. NIST software development kit testing of fingerprint matching
10. effect of image size and compression on one-to-one fingerprint matching.
11. NISAT fingerprint image quality algorithm
12. fingerprint technology evaluation 2003.     
13.matching performance for the US-VISIT-IDENT system 
14. NIST/ANSI-ITL-2000 fingerprint data exchange standard.

Question #1: Will the current NCC model be the model to be implemented? 
 
EEOC Response: Only to the extent that the current NCC model follows call center industry best practices and only to the extent that we will continue to use the Intervoice Brite IVR system which we own and the RightNow CRM hosted solution for which we currently have 60 licenses.  EEOC will also require call quality monitoring to be provided as in the current NCC model.

Question #2:  Will we have access to the current operation and organizational plan, structure/ budget- technology, staffing, schedules, standards of performance, call flow and line configuration including IVR/VRU scripts, knowledge 
management support, locations, etc.?
 
EEOC Response:  We can provide copies of scripts, FAQs, data capture protocols from our current knowledge management database.  Information on the remaining items will only be available to the extent they are included in the January 2007 National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) report.  Copies of the NAPA report can be made available; however, it also can be found on the NAPA website, www.napawash.org.

Question #3:  Will we have access to ACD reports detailing call types, volumes, length of call, after call work, hold times, etc.?
 
EEOC Response:  Yes.  We have monthly reports from the current vendor which provides this information.

Question #4:  Can we get a copy of the 9 action items resulting from the NCC 2-year pilot?
 
EEOC Response:  Yes.  The nine (9) action items are listed below:
 	
   1.      Increase the call volume to the NCC.
   2.      Route all initial calls made to the EEOC to the NCC.
   3.      Integrate EEOC and NCC processes and technology.
   4.      Create a uniform intake questionnaire.
   5.      Establish a reporting process to provide operational data.
   6.      Measure and monitor customer satisfaction.
   7.      Execute change management procedures.
   8.      Assess the costs and benefits of the NCC and assess alternative approaches.
   9.      Establish a steering committee to monitor NCC performance.


Question #5:  Is there a preferred vendor for this proposal?

EEOC Response:  No. 

Question #6:  Will there be EEOC staff available to support this effort? To what level?   (_# of full-time staff, part-time staff, etc.)
 
EEOC Response:  EEOC will have a point of contact to provide copies of reports and other information requested; however, we will not have staff assigned specifically to support this effort.
