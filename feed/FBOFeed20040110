<DESC>Measurements International Resistance Measurement System.  Issue Date:  10 January 2004.  Closing Date:  10 February 2004.  AFMETCAL Det 1 intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Measurements International, 812 Proctor Avenue, Ogdensburg NY 13669. The proposed procurement under RFQ FY2333-04-Q-0024, is for Measurements International to upgrade the hardware and software of the Resistance Measurement System that is currently in the AF inventory.  The objective of this procurement is to upgrade the existing system by having selected hardware and software components either upgraded or replaced with more modern and improved technology components.  Supplies and services are available from only one responsible source, no other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  If no written response is received by February 10, 2004, to the effect that comparable items/services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these items/services through a sole-source procurement with Measurements International, a sole-source award will be made.

Introduction

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (hereinafter referred to as ABEA@), located at 1441 L Street, NW, Washington, DC is scheduled to begin its comprehensive carpet replacement and cyclical painting beginning in January, 2004.  

BEA occupies 140,000 net usable square feet.  BEA has ten divisions and 440 employees and approximately 40 non-agency personnel.  Of the 10 floors fully- or partially- occupied by BEA, approximately 81,000 square feet will be recarpeted.  BEA has 2 swing space areas which can accommodate 37 and 55 persons.  If needed, an additional area accommodating 15 workstations can be used for selected cycles.  BEA is seeking a Contractor to handle communication, management, and coordination for and between bureau and program management, employees, and vendors.  Timely project completion is paramount.

Background

To accomplish the recarpeting, BEA needs to move program units from their currently assigned location to swing space available within building number.  Careful planning and coordination are required to schedule the moves which cannot be accomplished within two weeks of releases.  It will take 4 to 6 weeks to complete a cycle.  BEA has approximately 54 releases involving staff from 10 different divisions.  Some divisions are being returned to their currently assigned space, others are moving to new locations which must be included in the plan.

The project must be managed to accommodate the various division work and release schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who shall coordinate set up schedule, coordinate activities between the program units, move Contractor, furniture Contractor, lessor, and Bureau management.

The project should be scheduled to finish in the Fall of 2004.

Project Dates

Immediately through Fall 2004.


Description of Work

Project Management


The Contractor shall manage BEA=s carpet replacement and cyclical painting project.  BEA management must be consulted and kept fully informed.  BEA employees must be directed through the process to lessen anxiety and maximize effectiveness of the project.  Effective communication with management, program leaders, and employees will be mandatory.

Develop a communication and management plan which will include substantive information on the procedure to be implemented to ensure effective and efficient management of the program.  The plan will include schedules, budgets, information for distribution to all groups, coordination tasks, and other items which will ensure a successful program.

Coordination of vendor activities

Develop a coordination plan including schedules by working with all contractor involved, including the moving company, rental furniture contractor, building owner/building management company, and other related contractors.  The coordination plan will identify all requirements for the contractors including schedules, instructions, conducting interaction between groups, and requirements for the vendors.  The plan will be implemented to ensure that all contractors perform with maximum efficiency.

Scope and Complexity

Because scheduling and coordination are critical to success, we have provided a list of releases and a chart showing the size of the program units.  These should be considered in the management, communications, and coordination plans.

<DESC>NA SOURCES SOUGHT: This Sources Sought is to identify small business capability to perform the following requirement.   The Military Traffic Management Command has a requirement to provide the transportation service needs of Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for  the movement of its small package ground shipments and to ensure that contractors providing transportation have the willingness and the capability to meet those needs and to provide the standardization necessary for the routing of the Department of Defens e (DOD) freight traffic and U. S. Government shipments of foreign military sales (FMS) material.  MTMC is initiating a new form of contract for freight transportation services. The new form is called Tailored Transportation Contracts (TTC).  MTMC has two a cquisition goals to achieve by using the new Tailored Transportation Contract . The two goals are: Conduct freight transportation services using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) compliant contracts and the use of performance-based contracts for the acq uisition of services.  MTMC is also using the new contract initiative as a means to streamline the process and procedures for contracting for freight services. The program consists of pickup from, transportation and delivery service to all commercial/military ZIP Codes (as defined by the U.S. Postal Service Zip Code Directory) within the Continental United States (CONUS), including the District of Columbia (DC).  This excludes small package delivery to Army Post Offices (APO), Fleet Post Offices (FPO), and U.S. Postal facilities, i.e., P. O. Boxes.
