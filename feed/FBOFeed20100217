Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during the forums with large primes, FAA technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.

ARRA funds for NASAsFundamental Aero Program are being utilized to help design and fabricate combustor rigimprovements to enable testing of advanced low nitrogen oxide (NOx) injector designs. The production of greenhouse gas emissions generated by aircraft exhaust, emissions suchas carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX) and water vapor will increase in proportionwithin the air transportation industry.  As a result, NASAs Fundamental Aero Program hasestablished goals to reduce fuel burn in future aircraft, reduced fuel burn correlates toreduced CO2 and NOX emissions.	This task will help design combustor rig improvementsthat will enable jet engine manufacturers to test  low emission jet engine combustors. Methods to test alternative fuel technologies (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch) need to bedeveloped for aircraft applications to reduce emissions, improve performance, anddecrease the nation's dependence on oil.

The estimated 480V DC, 4800AH battery bank will be connected to the PPU and provide energy storage and stability to the electrical distribution system.  All necessary safety and monitoring systems required for the battery installation are included.
This project also includes re-roofing the Main Prison Building; including removal of existing built-up roofing system on roof, parapet walls and curbs.  The new roof will consist of 2-ply modified bitumen on a reinforced concrete deck using a smooth cap sheet with a reflective coating.  Flashing, along with associated improvements and minor repair of some existing roof projections, is included with the re-roofing.  In addition, replace the bird deterrent system with an in-kind product.
Previous projects on Alcatraz Island have identified the presence of lead and asbestos in, and/or on, some of the existing materials.  Appropriate testing, abatement and/or construction precautions will be performed as part of this project.
Further develop and execute energy efficiency measures as outlined in the recent Alcatraz Island Energy Audit Report including: - Expanded Energy Audit and Demand Metering- Lighting Efficiency Analysis, Design, Recommendations and Upgrade- Water Heater Efficiency Recommendations- Mechanical Equipment Efficiency Analysis, Design and Recommendations- Operational Recommendations- Comprehensive Strategic Energy Management Plan for Alcatraz Island 
The contractor's design will be based upon the Schematic Design concept, project requirements narrative and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal (Phase Two).  Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions will be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.  The project process will follow the National Park Service (NPS) workflows (http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm ).  
The estimated price is between $5,000,000 and $7,500,000, including all design and construction.  All work will be completed no later than June 27, 2011.  ARRA funding has been secured for this project.  
The contract provides for preparation of design development, value analysis of system alternatives, and construction documents.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Science Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary, Vallejo, CA requires an 18'-6" fiberglass catamaran boat with engine and trailer. 
The boat, engine and trailer must meet the following specifications:
Description of Requirements:  The USGS Western Ecological Research Center, San Francisco Bay Estuary Field Station is requesting acquisition of a research vessel to replace an existing boat that is no longer safe or fully functional.  Our primary research focus is the San Francisco Bay estuary, a region with large expanses of shallow flats, as well as large waves and at times, rough water conditions.  Our work includes traveling long distances to field sites, repeated egress and boarding in marshes, extensive sampling including coring off the side of the boat, dredging samples, deploying nets, fast chase ability to capture migratory birds, and hauling of large equipment onboard including a bass hunter kayak with echosounder.Conditions under which work must be conducted: Our primary work is sampling and transport in shallow water flats or wetlands; however, we commute long distances across large estuary areas of open water under rough water conditions.  We need to be able to conduct sampling on a stable platform, attach and carry equipment onboard, and transport at least 4 staff.  We work in shallow flats and wetlands with heavy vegetation, sample invertebrates and eelgrass, core or winch off the side to obtain benthic samples, dredge for larger samples, deploy nets and netgun, and conduct bathymetry surveys.  We are looking for a vessel with limited maintenance requirements, because we do not have dedicated maintenance staff.Equipment to be delivered by the contractor:  We are seeking an 18.6' or larger hull catamaran-style fiberglass research vessel with non-skid surfaces that can operate with a 115 hp or larger 4-stroke outboard motor.  The vessel should include unsinkable positive flotation and be self-bailing with one-way scuppers.  It should include a central console with custom grab rails and railing along the gunwales to provide safety for the USGS staff.  The vessel must have the ability to motor in water as shallow as half an inch while still providing a smooth, dry ride in heavy seas.  The motor should be mounted on a hydraulic jack plate to allow running in shallow water, as well as hydraulic steering to ensure safe maneuverability.  The vessel should be capable of rated speeds of greater than 45 miles per hour in order to capture wildlife, come with a custom 4-blade propeller that allows it to safely operate at these speeds, and include a fuel tank of 35 gallons or more.  Additional accessories will include black nylon cleats, grounding block, 4 light switch panel, jackplate switch, binnacle control box, fey switch and wiring harness, multifunction tachometer with hours reading, water pressure gauge and assembly, control cables, accessory plug power point, fuel lines and fittings, water separator, fuel filter, fittings, starting battery to console, navigation light wire, switch, rear light, ice chest chocks, labor costs, if any. The vessel will come with a trailer custom built to fit the boat that is drive-on and drive-off capable.  The trailer should be designed with stainless steel and galvanized springs to ensure salt water tolerance, include a 2-inch hitch, and a spare tire and spare tire mount. 
Following are the line item numbers with their associated items, quantities, and units of measure.  Line item 0001, 18'-6" catamaran style fiberglass boat, line item 0002, 115 horse power, four stroke, outboard motor, line item 0003, trailer, line item 0004, shipping, if any.
The availability date is no later than April 15, 2010.  The delivery destination is:

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will receive no response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Technology Transition Support to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement and AFRL/SBIR Technology Transition Support Capability Package are attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Air Force Research Laboratory and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requir! ements.
The SBIR Technology Transition Support includes, but is not limited to, Customer Support, Planning and technical support to the AF SBIR Program Office to facilitate transition of SBIR products into use by AF acquisition programs. The support will require strong aerospace engineering expertise, business acumen, clarity in communicating technical information, and excellent technical writing /editing skills. The contractor will be within short commuting distance of each of the four AF Product Centers (LA Air Force Base, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Hanscom Air Force Base, and Eglin Air Force Base) and include an additional transition agent to support the three Air Logistics Centers.  The following provide additional details.  
This effort will require a current Secret Facility Clearance.
 The Air Force anticipates a one year contract with four one year options.   All respondents are required to currently hold a vehicle on the GSA FSS Schedule 871 Professional Engineering Services (PES) (871-1 through -6).
All respondents are required to certify they currently meet the small business requirements under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), 500 employees, as of the date of their proposal submittal.  This requirement is an anticipated set aside for those contractors that meet the small business NAICS 541712 certification requirement on the date of contract award, not when they last renewed their GSA contract.
All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package which explicitly demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  Foreign contractor participation at the prime level is not permitted.  The capabilities package requirements are to be presented in accordance with the attachments entitled "Capabilities package."  Your package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance relevant to the requirements cited above.  Your Capabilities Package should not exceed 15 pages and should include the following:  Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; Certification of small business status; GSA Schedule 70 contract number and expiration.  Please submit one (1) hardcopy of your response to ASC/PKEIS, Attn:  Travis McCullough, 2275 D. St, Bldg. 16, Rm. 128, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (937) 656-7475, and one (1) PDF formatted copy via email to Travis.McCullough@wpafb.af.mil.  Packages s! hould be submitted no later than 5:00pm, EST, March 9, 2010.  No facsimile responses will be accepted.
The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the PIXS website.
If you have any questions, you may contact Travis McCullough at Travis.McCullough@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>I.   Purpose:The purpose of the SIR is to seek competent and suitable sources for the subject project.  Responses to the SIR shall be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offers are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) which will evaluate each response received and make a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing.
Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business (4:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time) on March 18, 2010.
The assigned NAICS Code for this project is:  236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  
II.    Project Scope:  Construction of a major activity Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), base building/Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) and parking structure at McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada.  The ATCT will be an approximately 350 feet tall structure consisting of 22 levels with the top level being an 850 SF cab.  The main structural components of the ATCT shaft will be cast-in-place concrete and structural steel.  The ATCT construction may also include a tuned mass damper.  The ATCT will be linked to a four story 55,000 SF base building/TRACON constructed of cast-in-place concrete and structural steel.   The detached 2 level parking structure will support approximately 200 vehicles and will be constructed of cast-in-place concrete, pre-tensioned precast concrete and structural steel.  The facility will be constructed on a 3.5 acre site just west of Terminal 3 and located outside, but adjacent to, the airport security fence.
The work includes site clearing and restoration, access road construction and improvement, excavation and backfill, drilled concrete shaft foundations, cast-in-place reinforced concrete, structural steel, plumbing, mechanical, electrical and landscaping.
Anticipated award in Summer 2010, with anticipated construction through Summer 2012.
Magnitude of construction:  Between $30,000,000 and $60,000,000

-Mandatory Qualifications-Preferred Qualifications

Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable" in any Mandatory Qualifications area, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration.   One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offers, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc. 
Availability of funds:The government's obligation under the subject SIR is expressly contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds for each phase from which payment can be made.

All proposal areas must be fully addressed.  A negative response is required in the event of no experience for a particular area, or for any item that is not applicable.  Any omission, partial, or vague responses may lead to the rejection of the offeror's proposal without discussions with offeror.  The government reserves the right to use and evaluate any and all available information pertinent to any offeror and its subcontractors, in addition to the data incorporated in the submitted qualifications proposal, and which may be related to performance periods beyond the last three (3) years.Proposals shall not exceed 50 single-sided pages.

Any contractual issues or technical matters disputed and resolution thereof9.	Any claims and resolution thereof  (i.e. nature, number, dollar value)

Mandatory Qualifications
All of the following qualifications will be rated Acceptable/Unacceptable. A rating of Unacceptable in any single area will render the offeror disqualified.  Offerors have the responsibility for demonstrating they (offeror) meet the mandatory qualifications.  Offerors are encouraged to submit data/projects that successfully demonstrate they (offeror) meet the mandatory qualifications AND summarize how that/those data/projects demonstrates they (offeror) have met the mandatory qualifications.
Offerors that fail to receive a rating of "acceptable" in any of the mandatory qualification will removed from further consideration and will not be evaluated for the preferred qualifications.

1.	Successful completion of steel erection construction project with crane operations over 300 feet above ground level (AGL) in the past 3 years; AND
2.	Successful completion of cast-in-place concrete construction project with crane operations over 300 feet AGL in the past 3 years; AND

3.	Successful completion of construction projects averaging $30 million per year or more over the last 3 years.


Preferred Qualifications
All of the following qualifications will be rated with point values.  These point values will be used to support the IPT final report and recommendations.
Qualifications are listed by order of importance. Therefore criterion number one is more important than criterion number two and criterion number one is significantly more important than criterion number six.  Criterion two and three are of equal importance.  Criterion four is less important than two or three, though it has greater importance than five or six.  Criterion five and six are of equal importance.

The type of MSR required is a self-contained unit that would be placed into an existing laboratory room. The MSR is typically constructed from several layers of special metal alloys that provide shielding against magnetic and electromagnetic fields. Different metal layers may be composed of mu-metal, nickel-iron alloy, copper, and aluminum. The layers are assembled in specific ways to provide optimal shielding against magnetic and electromagnetic fields. The MSR typically contains a specialized door providing both access and good shielding, and ports of various sizes for ventilation and the passage of wires and cables from the equipment that may be used inside the MSR to outside the enclosure, to permit experiments and measurements to be conducted from outside the MSR. MSRs also have electrical coils exterior to the enclosure to provide active compensation to reduce environmental magnetic fields.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the required shielding will be provided with one or more layers of high permeability material and one or more layers of aluminum, copper, or other conductive material. Potential vendors are encouraged to provide information for&nbsp;products&nbsp;high shielding factors. Door provides full required shielding. Door can be opened by personnel inside the MSR in the event of a power failure, as well as opened externally.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This notice is published for market research purposes only to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of all qualified business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; (a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  This notice is open to qualified business sources of all sizes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541711.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method for the Advanced Development and Manufacturing of Biological Countermeasures.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>BACKGROUND AND MISSION:<BR><BR>Synopsis:  The Department of Defense (DoD) through the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical Biological Defense and the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems Joint Product Management Office (MITS-JPMO) has a requirement to develop and license a second generation prophylactic product, Bioscavenger, to be used in humans against nerve agents.  The product should be capable of strongly binding or degrading nerve agents before they can exhibit their toxic effects.  Potential candidates might include human butyrylcholinesterase (other than plasma-derived), other proteins, or compounds that have the property of binding or degrading nerve agents.  <BR><BR><BR>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>Development of the nerve agent prophylactic product shall require a Contractor to coordinate and manage the activities associated with advanced development of the product.  The Contractor will be responsible for conducting the various activities associated with drug/biologic development in manners that are consistent with eventual approval or licensure by the FDA, to include management of any subcontractors.  Activities will include manufacturing process development and related tasks, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant small-scale manufacturing and testing of the Bioscavenger product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing in animals, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in accordance with FDA regulations and guidelines.  <BR>	<BR>	There will be an option for continuing advanced development through FDA approval (or licensure) of the product following the successful completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial and Government reviews.  These follow-on advanced development activities may include, but are not necessarily limited to, large-scale manufacturing, process-validation, definitive animal efficacy and expanded safety studies, conduct of a Phase 2 and/or 3 clinical trials, and filing of a New Drug Application/Biologics License Application.  There will be a 2nd option for the production up to 350,000 doses of the product, to be exercised following the successful licensure or approval of the product and successful government reviews. <BR><BR>The DoD will only consider those Bioscavenger candidates for which preliminary in vivo safety and efficacy data already exist.  Due to urgent need and a stringent timeline, consideration cannot be given to chemicals or proteins for which there are no proof of concept data in relevant animal models. (These preliminary studies should be substantial but do not need to be compliant with Good Laboratory Practices.)  Offerors will be requested to submit a proposal that clearly represents technical and regulatory approaches. Participants must demonstrate the ability to provide Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP), current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) compliance related to the development of the product for use in pre-clinical and clinical studies.<BR>  <BR>The requirements for successful execution encompass a broad range of capabilities.  Offerors are encouraged to partner or subcontract with contract manufacturers, clinical research organizations, etc. as necessary to span these capabilities.  <BR><BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS:  <BR><BR>Sources having the capability and/or concept to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this SSN.

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole-source, fixed-price procurement with Colt Defense LLC, 547 New Park Avenue, West Hartford, CT 06110-1336 under RFQ0221770.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (<a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/">www.fedbizopps.gov</a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Colt Defense LLC will provide repair and maintenance parts of Colt .223 caliber carbines manufactured by Colt. Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government, and the related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the referenced Colt .223 parts can only be provided by Colt Defense, LLC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) Standardization: The Colt Defense, Colt pattern, LE Tactical A4 Carbines are built to Colt pattern standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The parts provided by Colt Defense are generally Mil-Spec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Substituting parts made by other manufacturers may result in malfunctions or degraded weapon performance.

(3) Warranty: Carbines manufactured by Colt Defense are supplied with a limited warranty, which covers the expense for repairs for a five year period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The use of non-Colt Defense parts in repairing and maintaining these carbines could result in the voiding of any warranty coverage, exposing the government to potentially significant unwarranted additional expense. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement&nbsp;to this office by 10:00 am (Eastern), March 1, 2010, via facsimile to the attention of: Amy Lacy, at 703-632-6103 or via email to aelacy@fbiacademy.edu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information received, will be solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The North American Industrial Classification System Number (NAICS) is 332994-Small Arms Manufacturing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at <a href="http://orca.bpn.gov/">http://orca.bpn.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC><br />KAF-RCC 22 January 2010
<p>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for Purchase of Mabey Johnson Bridge Parts</p>
<p>1. Contracting Activity: Regional Contracting Center (RCC), Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan.<br />2. Requiring Agency: USARCENT, Fort McPherson, Georgia, POC LTC Charles Hemphill at commercial: (404)464-2294/DSN: 312-367-2294 or CPT Eric Von Fischer-Benzon at commercial: (404)464-2163/DSN: 312-367-2163.<br />3. Description of Action: This action is being requested as a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract utilizing Operations &amp; Maintenance Army (OMA) funding.<br />4. Description of Supplies: The supplies include bridge parts with an estimate totaling $2,300,748.19. See quote number BR-0062729 for a listing of product details. This procurement will be a Firm-Fixed Price.<br />5. Authorities Cited: FAR Subpart 13.500(a), "The subpart authorizes, as a test program, use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $5.5 million ($11 million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(e)), including options, of the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items. Under this test program, contracting officers may use any simplified acquisition procedure in this part, subject to any specific dollar limitation applicable to the particular procedure. The purpose of this test program is to vest contracting officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so that commercial item acquisitions in this dollar range may be solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs for both the Government and industry." Memorandum dated 30 December 2009, Subject: Class Deviation-Extension of Authority for Use of Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Certain Commercial Items that extends FAR Subpart 13.5 authority through 01 January 2012.<br />6. Circumstances and Facts: In February 2009, USARCENT shipped factory sealed containers containing bridge parts from the CENTCOM Theater Reserve in Kuwait to Afghanistan. Shortages were found during inventories of the Mabey Johnson Bridges that were shipped. USARCENT must replace the missing bridge parts for the Mabey Johnson Bridges to be FOC. USFOR-A J8 is providing the funding to the ARCENT G8 to execute the purchase of the identified missing bridge parts on the PR&amp;C. These parts have a NATO NSN that cannot be ordered through the Army ordering system. USARCENT Engineers are working with DLA to add the MJB bridge part NSNs to the Army supply system, but it could take an additional 30 days to have all the required parts added to the system. Duplication of efforts would include reprocuring an entirely new bridging system in order to create competition for this requirement which will not prove to be cost effective and could potentially double the costs already incurred.<br />7. Efforts to Obtain Competition: This is not applicable, due to fact, these bridging systems are already being utilized in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mabey Johnson Bridge systems are the only manufacturer for these parts and no other manufacturers parts or contractors have compatable items.<br />8. Actions to Increase Competition: This is not applicable, due to fact, these bridging systems are already being utilized in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mabey Johnson Bridge systems are the only manufacturer for these parts and no other manufacturers parts or contractors have compatable items.<br />9. Market Research: Market research has revealed that Mabey Johnson Bridge systems are the only manufacturer for these parts and no other manufacturers parts or contractors have compatable items.<br />10. Interested Sources: There are no other interested sources for this requirement. <br />11. Other Facts: This office has never purchased these items, therefore, there is no procurement history data available for this requirement. There are no technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, additional statements of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition because Mabey Johnson Bridge systems are the only manufacturer that can provide the required parts.<br />12. Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: IAW FAR Subpart 15.403-1(c)(3)(i), this requirement is exempt from cost or pricing data. I hereby determine that the anticipated cost or price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable. In order to determine a fair and reasonable price, items from the Mabey Bridge &amp; Shore, Incorporated quote dated 22 Jan 2010 were compared to contract number W91GF5-09-P-0344 which RCC Balad awarded on 31 Mar 09. The contract contained some of the items which are being procured for this contract action. The vendor's most recent price list was also referenced and compared and the results are listed below.<br />Item<br />Quote #BR-0062729<br />Contract #W91FG5-09-P-0344<br />Current Price List<br />Brace Vertical<br />$49.52<br />$58.26<br />$58.26<br />Screw-Dec<br />$2.39<br />$2.81<br />$2.81<br />Nut-Deck Screw<br />$1.78<br />$2.09<br />$2.09<br />Hammer, Club 1KG<br />$11.64<br />$13.69<br />$13.69<br />Plate, Jack Head<br />$95.32<br />$112.14<br />$112.14</p>
<p>13. Contracting Officer Certification: I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />Brian E. Sonnier:_____________________________ Date:_________________________<br />Title: MSgt, USAF, Contingency Contracting Officer <br />14. Approval: Based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve the procurement of the bridge parts on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b)(2), "For sole source (including brand name) acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to Subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply." FAR Subpart 13.500(a), "The subpart authorizes, as a test program, use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $5.5 million ($11 million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(e)), including options, of the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with International Radiation Detectors (IRD) for:
<p>Si Photodiode, AXUV-100G, specifications, include minimum shunt resistance 500 MOhm. Choosen from lots by devices: 09-923, 09-235, 09-413. The Far and extreme ultraviolet calibration service disseminates the U.S. national scale of detector responsivity by issuing transfer standard photodiodes in the spectral range from 5 nm to 254 nm. We maintain a stock of detectors and stock is extremely low.</p>
<p>IRD is the sole manufacturer. So NIST can purchase these specific equipments only from IRD.</p>
<p>Based on NIST's recent market research, NIST has only identified the one source that can provide the required International Radiation Detector, Torrance, CA.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability.

<DESC>RECOVERY TAS::14 1041::TAS CHOH PMIS # 151930 - Stabilize Historic Culvery 182SUBJECT TO THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009
THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is only being offered to contractors awarded indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under a competitive acquisition by the National Park Service. The IDIQ contracts are for construction services for repair and maintenance of historic stone masonry and concrete throughout Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The IDIQ contractors are The Christman Company (Contract No. C2000091300), Firvida Construction Company (Contract No. C2000093000), Forrester Construction Company (Contract No. C2000093300), Conservation Solutions, Inc. (Contract No. C2000093400), Preservation Trades Company (Contract No. C2000093500), and Worcester Eisenbrandt Construction (Contract No. C2000093700).
This ARRA project will stabilize Culvert 182, a single span (40 foot span, 15 foot high rise) stone masonry culvert.  The Culvert spans Little Tonoloway Creek and was constructed in 1840.  The last major stabilization effort took place in 1974 when repairs were made after the flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes.  The culvert is in a deteriorated condition.  The voussoir stones are separating from the barrel and there are large voids in the barrel at the spring line.  In addition, there are shear cracks through individual stones along the spring line. The prism has been re-watered in this section of the canal for interpretation and recreation.  The leaking through the culvert barrel has increased over the last five years and concrete patches placed in the 1970's are beginning to fail.The Government anticipates soliciting this work approximately March 1, 2010. Selection of the successful contractor for this task order will be based on the evaluation factors in the IDIQ contract and specific evaluation factors in the request for proposals for this order.The NAICS Code is 238140.

<DESC><strong>This procurement was previously announced on FBO.gov on November 9, 2009.</strong><br /><br />The Department of Education is releasing this solicitation for the First Follow-up of the Department of Education's High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:2009). The first follow-up to the High School Longitudinal Study: 2009 is the second round of a large, complex data collection designed to continue the series of longitudinal data collection efforts that began with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72), and was followed by High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). HSLS:09 began with a ninth grade cohort in the fall of 2009. The cohort will be re-contacted in spring 2012 when most of the sample are 11th graders. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 will survey students and their parents, administrators, and school counselors. Eleventh grade students will be asked to complete a mathematics assessment that focuses on algebraic skills and reasoning. The method of data collection will include computer adaptive technology and telephone interviews. The first follow-up of this study will culminate with data files, a First Look report, and data file documentation. The work will be monitored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Highlights for this study include: The new additional College Update data collection in the spring of 2013; the survey's emphasis on course-taking, college preparation, college financing, and plans for the 2013-2014 year; no teacher data collection in spring 2012, but student, parent, administrator, and counselor data. The proposal should concentrate on demonstrating expertise in sample design, computer administered assessments, computer assisted interviewing, large scale data collections, working with school districts and schools, writing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance packages, methodological reports; and proven, successful experience in providing a large pool of field interviewers on short notice with differing time durations.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-38.     

This announcement constitutes the only Total Small Business Set-Aside solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 221210, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for Laboratory Gas Cylinder rentals and laboratory gases.

Statement of Work (SOW)

Requirements
Gas tank rentals are associated with the delivery of laboratory gases supplied by the vendor for consumption by the Northeast Regional Laboratory. Laboratory gases are essential to the operation of most laboratory instrumentation.  Some instruments require highly purified inert gases (such as helium or argon) as carriers to move the analyte of interest through the system. Other instruments use gases as fuel (such as hydrogen or acetylene) or oxidizers (such as air) to vaporize the analyte of interest.  Liquid nitrogen is used to cool instruments and/or analytes during analysis.  At times, specialty gas mixtures are used as standards for the calibration of analytical instrumentation.  A modern analytical laboratory can not function without a reliable supply of laboratory gases.
 The basic requirements are as follows:

•	Supplying a wide range of laboratory gases.  See Attachment A

•	Fulfilling orders within 24 – 48 hours on a regular basis.

•	Same day delivery on an emergency basis.

•	Offers safe gas handling training to NRL laboratory personnel once per year, included in yearly gas tank rental costs.

•	ISO 9001 Certified

Please see Attachment A for a price breakdown chart to be completed.

Period of Performance

Base year and 4 option years.

Place of Performance

158-15 Liberty Avenue
Jamaica, NY 11433

Evaluation Criteria

1.	Technical Capability:  The contractor can provide all of the items listed under the SOW and laboratory gas list (attachment A).
2.	Relevant Experience:  The contract has provided the same or similar experience to the government or other companies within the last 3 years.  
3.	Price.

Technical Capability and Relevant Experience combined are significantly more important than price.

CCR: Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need your Dun & Bradstreet number and banking information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2010-051-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 (2/1/2010).

Period of Performance:  The proposed performance for this service will consist of one (12) month basic contract period. 

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541519 and the business size standard is 500 Employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the following services from Information Management Services, Inc., 12501 Prosperity Drive, Suite 200, Silver Spring, Maryland 20904.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation’s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people’s health and save lives.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBI) is in need of support services to roll out the BSI-II system to an additional nine labs.  BSI is a software system for biospecimen management that will be customized to meet the unique business needs of NHLBI-DIR. BSI provides specimen, freezer, shipment, and workflow management in a validated secure software environment. By utilizing BSI, NHLBI will improve their ability to manage their specimens and comply with congressional reporting mandates. 

IMS is uniquely qualified to provide this support for NHLBI. IMS provided the support for the labs during the initial pilot period, and is familiar with their specimen workflows and data. IMS is the sole owner of the BSI system, and is the only company that can modify, implement, and deploy any system enhancements or patches. IMS also currently provides the database hosting for the NHLBI BSI database, and is solely responsible for it availability. IMS maintains over 15 employees dedicated to the BSI project, and can provide additional staff on short notice for periods of heavy workloads. 

PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION:

In late 2008, NHLBI commissioned a pilot test of a biospecimen inventory system to last approximately three months.  The purpose of the pilot was to test the utility of IMS’s BSI-II product in five labs.  The pilot activities include user training, software deployment, and a period of ongoing usage.  NHLBI’s ultimate goal for this activity is to deploy a biospecimen inventory system that most effectively supports the Institute’s business mission. To support the execution of this pilot and to support the subsequent commissioning of a biospecimen inventory system for use across the Institute, HealthCare IT, Inc. (HCIT) assisted NHLBI and IMS in the execution of a pilot test of the BSI II application software in five labs.  For those pilot labs, the software was very well received by the users and NHLBI have agreed to utilize BSI-II at an enterprise level.

Starting in February of 2010 NHLBI will initiate the roll-out of BSI-II to an additional nine (9) labs and provide data conversion, training and overall project management support through January 2011. 

The estimated level of effort is 2902 direct labor hours.

Project Administration

The Contractor will be responsible for managing this contract, responding to budget inquires, generating weekly progress reports, metrics, preparing Request For Enhancement (RFE) documents, and other documentation requested by NHLBI, as well as providing overall administration for the contract.  This Project Administration will require 384 Labor Hours.

Database Extraction

The Contractor will be responsible for creating a new NHLBI intramural database and to transfer all records from the current NHLBI extramural database. This separation will allow NHBLI intramural to be solely responsible for the future development decisions of the database.  This Database Extraction will require 112 Labor Hours.

Data Conversion/ Programming

The Contractor will be responsible for programming required to change or enhance the system, or provide data conversion support for importing existing specimen or subject data. There are several system enhancements that have been identified by NHLBI at this time. These enhancements include: 

•	The ability to define, store, and manage subject longitudinal data. 
•	The ability to add subject verifiers to the system. 
•	Quick Withdraw: An interface for performing specimen withdraws without using the requisition editor. This interface would allow the user to select specimens and mark them as out using a single simplified interface. The interface would integrate into the existing requisition brokers to provide the same tracking as the current editor. 

Other possible enhancements to the system that have not been formally requested but may be of interest include: 

•	A module for tracking specimen test results. 
•	User defined sample and vial fields. 
•	Communications with other systems (CRIS, BTRIS, CDS, etc). 
•	Additional support for the BSI checklist interface. 
•	Improvements in the BSI web interface. 
•	Addition of a drag and drop report editor for creating custom reports. 

In addition, as the labs continue to use the system it is expected that they will request new reports, translations, edit checks, data fields, etc. during the contract period. This budget item is in anticipation of these requests. All system modification requests will be processed through the BSI RFE procedures and require NHLBI approval prior to implementation. 

This item is also to provide support for data conversion for new and existing labs. Data conversion is very hard to estimate prior to an examination of the data. The labor required to convert data can vary substantially depending on the format of the data and the amount of data cleansing required prior to conversion. Any conversions requested by the lab would be processed using the BSI RFE workflow and require NHLBI approval prior to implementation.  This Data Conversion/Programming will require 990 Labor Hours.

Technical Support (On-site & Remote)

IMS has adapted the training from the original pilot to better suit lab availability and workflows. IMS will divide the training phases into introduction, training, launch support, and maintenance. The introduction phase will be a half day session that will concentrates on IMS learning the lab workflow processes and providing a brief introduction to the data flows in the system. IMS can then generate a customized training course that is specific to the labs workflow. Using this course, training sessions will then be held in the lab to provide detailed instruction on how to use BSI to support the existing workflow. The launch support phase anticipates a high amount of requests for assistance during the first month of usage. Launch support allows IMS to provide additional help in setting up reports, data entry templates, workflow checklists, requisition templates, etc. 

After the lab is trained, IMS will continue to provide on-site and remote support as requested (maintenance support). Normally the amount of support required decreases as the lab staff becomes accustomed to the BSI interface. This Technical Support will require 860 Labor Hours. 

Implementation at six additional labs

The Contractor will expand the number of labs currently using BSI. This assumes an introduction to BSI, workflow gathering & documentation, repository/user setup, and training for lab. This Implementation at six additional labs will require 556 Labor Hours.

Updates and Release Schedule

The Contractor will update the system on a monthly basis for all non-high impact programming changes. High impact modifications (e.g. new modules) will be released on an annual basis. Emergency modifications will be reviewed and addressed within 2-3 business days.

Progress Reports

The Contractor will generate a Monthly Status Report (MSR) summarizing the work performed during the past month. Attached to the progress, IMS will also provide an Excel spreadsheet to track expenses on the contract.  IMS will bill NHLBI with invoices on a four week interval. 

The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Past Performance Submission:  Quoters are required to provide information on no more than two (2) of the firm's most recently completed federal government contracts (not to exceed five (5) years since completion) that are relevant (like or similar) to the services being provided under this solicitation.  Quoters may submit past performance on less than two (2) contracts or orders but no more than two (2).
Past performance as a prime contractor on Federal contracts, especially DoD, will be preferred over and scored higher than past performance on state and local government and commercial contracts.  Submit Federal, then state and local government, or commercial contracts, in that order of preference, to complete this submission.  Past performance as the prime contractor will be preferred over and scored higher than past performance as a subcontractor.  
Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  
Vendors should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of this solicitation.  Relevance is defined as similarity in scope, complexity, and magnitude.  
Vendors lacking any relevant past performance should mark and sign the appropriate block on the past performance information submission form.  
Quoters shall provide the following information on each prior contract.
(a) Contract or purchase order number(s),
(b) Name, telephone number and, if known, E-mail address of point of contact at the federal, state, local government or commercial entity for which the contract or order was performed,

Quotes submitted shall be in accordance with the Schedule of Supplies and Services contained in the solicitation.  Quotes shall be held firm for sixty (60) days


EVALUATION
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Past Performance and Price.  
(b) A written order in response to the vendor's quotation will be e-mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor.  The Contracting Officer may ask the vendor to provide written acceptance of an order.  In other circumstances the vendor may indicate acceptance by proceeding with the services ordered.
Quotations will be evaluated as follows:
a)  Past performanceb)  Price
PAST PERFORMANCE
The Past Performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106.
The Government will determine whether the vendor's past performance submissions are, in order of preference, relevant, somewhat relevant or not-relevant contracts based on three factors: scope, complexity and magnitude.  
Relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of all three factors.Somewhat relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of some of the three factors.
Not-relevant - the past performance submission fails to meet the criteria of all three factors.
For past performance submissions determined to be relevant or somewhat relevant, the Government will make a reasonable effort to collect and evaluate past performance information from the point(s) of contact identified by the vendor or, at the discretion of the contracting officer, other points of contact.  The vendor acknowledges that the Government is not responsible if the point of contact provided by the vendor fails to respond to the Government's past performance inquiry.  Vendors are also advised that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government, including Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS).  
The Government will evaluate the vendor's Past Performance in order to assess performance risk.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a vendor's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information.  The adjectival ratings that will be used to establish performance risk will be generally correlated with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the vendor's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the vendor will very successfully perform the required effort.  (Highly Acceptable)
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the vendor's performance record, little doubt exists  that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort.  (Acceptable)
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the vendor's performance record, some doubt exists that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort.  (Marginal)
High Performance Risk:  Based on the vendor's performance record, significant doubt exists that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort.  (Unsatisfactory)
Neutral: Unknown performance risk assessment.  Vendors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. However, the submittal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the quotes of other vendors having an acceptable (or better) past performance. 
PRICE
The vendor's proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to:  
     a. Price comparison with other offerors;     b. Completeness:  all pricing information as it directly related to what is requested in 	the solicitation;      c. Comparison with independent Government cost estimates.
Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.  
AWARD DECISION
The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Subpart 13.1.  The Government shall select the vendor whose quote represents the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance when compared to other quotations.  The Government also reserves the right to not award a contract if a contract award is not in the best interest of the Government.

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Background:  The purpose of this requirement is to obtain technical, financial and legal assistance and support to enable the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accomplish Enhanced-Use Lease projects in a manner that maximizes available benefits to VA.  The Enhanced-Use Lease Authority, Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to outlease facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) to improve services, provide facilities, and/or generate revenue.  Enhanced-Use Leases are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of facilities under VAs jurisdiction of control to the public or private sector.  The facility can be used for both VA and compatible non-VA uses.  In return, VA receives cash and/or goods, services, facilities, or other in-kind consideration.  This program is administrated by VAs Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM).OAEM follows instructions and guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other agency instruction and guidance containing specific capital asset performance metrics.  Multi functional contractor support services are needed to assist the OAEM in a variety of functions that supports the enhanced-use lease management program in accordance with the Title 38, U. S.

The FHVC provides health care and services to the nations veterans, and it is located at 9600 North Point Road, Fort Howard, MD.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In response to the 7.0 earthquake on January 12, 2010 that devastated the Haitian city of Port-au-Prince, OFDA deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to lead the U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian response. Haiti has long been the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with social and economic indicators among the worst in the world. Continuing political instability, civil unrest, environmental degradation, and lack of capacity within the national government create a context where even moderate-sized natural hazards have significant negative impact on the Haitian populace. In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, over $13 million was provided in response to natural disasters in Haiti.<br /><br />At present, OFDA has provided over $100 million in humanitarian awards supporting programs in shelter, health, nutrition, humanitarian coordination and information management, risk reduction, water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, non-food items, and logistical support and continues to identify programming possibilities based upon ongoing needs assessments on the ground.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response and rehabilitation post-earthquake.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires willingness to travel outside of Port-au-Prince on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Haiti, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Haiti Mission, the US Embassy, other U.S. Agencies as appropriate, international organizations (IOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the United Nations (UN), to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Office in San Jose, Costa Rica, OFDA Washington, and USAID Haiti and U.S. Embassy/Haiti, as required.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the US Embassy, other USG agencies such as Department of Defense (DOD) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Government of Haiti (GOH), U.S. military representatives, as well as with relevant United Nations (UN) and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for Latin America and the Caribbean and in consultation with USAID/Haiti, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Haiti for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy and other U.S Agencies, military representatives, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in Haiti. <br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in Haiti. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/LAC on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate closely with OFDA/LAC, the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, other U.S. agencies, and military representatives as well as the UN and NGO agencies working in Haiti.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of GOH activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/LAC.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA's approach to humanitarian protection. Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/LAC on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GOH, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the OFDA/LAC PRA and OFDA/Washington, as necessary. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Haiti, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. Embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA/LAC PRA and OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for LAC will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions 4:<br /></span></strong>1) Who provides the DVD/VCR and audio amplifier for Room 236? If provided by the contractor, what are the desired specifications on the amplifier?
<p>2) For all rooms requiring LCD monitors, what type of mounts are to be used? Flat, tilt, or articulating?</p>
<p>3) In Room 236, does the matrix switcher need to have to ability to bring in all computer feeds (approximately 8) as well as the CCTV feed and the CATV feed, and then disburse them to the desired LCD using only one input on each of the LCD monitors? If not, then is it desired to have the monitors have a CCTV and CATV feed at each LCD and the matrix be used as an input only for the PC's and then output to a third input on each of the LCD's? If the matrix is to control all functions, then CATV and CCTV feeds will not be necessary at each LCD, only the feed from the Credenza mounted matrix. The simplest way to ask this question may be this, is it expected that the matrix switcher and touch screen system will handle all incoming source feeds and disburse them with a single feed to each LCD monitor, or is it expected that the touch screen control will handle input switching on each of the LCD's for CCTV and CATV and the matrix will handle PC switching?</p>
<p>4) What will the source(s) be for the projector in Room 236? Will this unit be a fifth source off of the CCTV, CATV, PC touch screen matrix setup?</p>
<p>5) Is there a required finish material for the credenza in Room 236?</p>
<p>6) Can the monitors can vary in size at all. i.e. can they be larger since most manufacturers sizes vary slightly?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answers 4:</span></strong><br />1) The contractor is responsible for all A/V equipment and sizing it appropriately for each room. We would expect the amp to provide distortion free audio out to the speakers in that room; when, the volume is set to a level that can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>2) All will require tilt and maybe a couple will require articulating.</p>
<p>3) It is expected that the matrix switcher and touch screen system will handle all incoming source feeds and disburse them with a single feed to each LCD monitor.</p>
<p>4) The projector should be considered as an output from the switcher.</p>
<p>5) It will be required to have an aesthetically pleasing finish to complement the other furniture in the room, probably a Cherry finish.</p>
<p>6) The monitors can be larger, but no smaller. However, quotations will be evaluated based on the minimum requirements set forth in the statement of work (i.e. the costs of larger monitor will affect your total price).</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 5:<br /></strong></span>You released some additional information this morning regarding the switching requirement for Room 236. Your reply was "It is expected that the matrix switcher and touch screen system will handle all incoming source feeds and disburse them with a single feed to each LCD monitor." The original document states that the four monitors will display "CATV, CCTV and approximately 8 PC feeds". It does not say that the projector should handle CATV or CCTV feeds. If literally all feeds must go through the matrix switcher per the reply, that changes the design in a significant way. I wanted to clarify whether or not this was intended, and whether I should change my design to meet this new information?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 5:</span></strong><br />For room 236, basically everything will be routed through the matrix switcher which is controlled by the touch panel controller. All feeds should be routed through the matrix switcher which in turn can route any input to any output device, monitors and projector. The Government will be responsible for supplying the CCTV and CATV source to the switcher. All other cables from the PCs are provided by the contractor.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541519 and the business size standard is $25.M. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the following services from Information Management Services, Inc., 12501 Prosperity Drive, Suite 200, Silver Spring, Maryland 20904.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation’s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people’s health and save lives.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBI) is in need of support services to roll out the BSI-II system to an additional nine labs.  BSI is a software system for biospecimen management that will be customized to meet the unique business needs of NHLBI-DIR. BSI provides specimen, freezer, shipment, and workflow management in a validated secure software environment. By utilizing BSI, NHLBI will improve their ability to manage their specimens and comply with congressional reporting mandates. 

IMS is uniquely qualified to provide this support for NHLBI. IMS provided the support for the labs during the initial pilot period, and is familiar with their specimen workflows and data. IMS is the sole owner of the BSI system, and is the only company that can modify, implement, and deploy any system enhancements or patches. IMS also currently provides the database hosting for the NHLBI BSI database, and is solely responsible for it availability. IMS maintains over 15 employees dedicated to the BSI project, and can provide additional staff on short notice for periods of heavy workloads. 

PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION:

In late 2008, NHLBI commissioned a pilot test of a biospecimen inventory system to last approximately three months.  The purpose of the pilot was to test the utility of IMS’s BSI-II product in five labs.  The pilot activities include user training, software deployment, and a period of ongoing usage.  NHLBI’s ultimate goal for this activity is to deploy a biospecimen inventory system that most effectively supports the Institute’s business mission. To support the execution of this pilot and to support the subsequent commissioning of a biospecimen inventory system for use across the Institute, HealthCare IT, Inc. (HCIT) assisted NHLBI and IMS in the execution of a pilot test of the BSI II application software in five labs.  For those pilot labs, the software was very well received by the users and NHLBI have agreed to utilize BSI-II at an enterprise level.

Starting in February of 2010 NHLBI will initiate the roll-out of BSI-II to an additional nine (9) labs and provide data conversion, training and overall project management support through January 2011. 

The estimated level of effort is 2902 direct labor hours.

Project Administration

The Contractor will be responsible for managing this contract, responding to budget inquires, generating weekly progress reports, metrics, preparing Request For Enhancement (RFE) documents, and other documentation requested by NHLBI, as well as providing overall administration for the contract.  This Project Administration will require 384 Labor Hours.

Database Extraction

The Contractor will be responsible for creating a new NHLBI intramural database and to transfer all records from the current NHLBI extramural database. This separation will allow NHBLI intramural to be solely responsible for the future development decisions of the database.  This Database Extraction will require 112 Labor Hours.

Data Conversion/ Programming

The Contractor will be responsible for programming required to change or enhance the system, or provide data conversion support for importing existing specimen or subject data. There are several system enhancements that have been identified by NHLBI at this time. These enhancements include: 

•	The ability to define, store, and manage subject longitudinal data. 
•	The ability to add subject verifiers to the system. 
•	Quick Withdraw: An interface for performing specimen withdraws without using the requisition editor. This interface would allow the user to select specimens and mark them as out using a single simplified interface. The interface would integrate into the existing requisition brokers to provide the same tracking as the current editor. 

Other possible enhancements to the system that have not been formally requested but may be of interest include: 

•	A module for tracking specimen test results. 
•	User defined sample and vial fields. 
•	Communications with other systems (CRIS, BTRIS, CDS, etc). 
•	Additional support for the BSI checklist interface. 
•	Improvements in the BSI web interface. 
•	Addition of a drag and drop report editor for creating custom reports. 

In addition, as the labs continue to use the system it is expected that they will request new reports, translations, edit checks, data fields, etc. during the contract period. This budget item is in anticipation of these requests. All system modification requests will be processed through the BSI RFE procedures and require NHLBI approval prior to implementation. 

This item is also to provide support for data conversion for new and existing labs. Data conversion is very hard to estimate prior to an examination of the data. The labor required to convert data can vary substantially depending on the format of the data and the amount of data cleansing required prior to conversion. Any conversions requested by the lab would be processed using the BSI RFE workflow and require NHLBI approval prior to implementation.  This Data Conversion/Programming will require 990 Labor Hours.

Technical Support (On-site & Remote)

IMS has adapted the training from the original pilot to better suit lab availability and workflows. IMS will divide the training phases into introduction, training, launch support, and maintenance. The introduction phase will be a half day session that will concentrates on IMS learning the lab workflow processes and providing a brief introduction to the data flows in the system. IMS can then generate a customized training course that is specific to the labs workflow. Using this course, training sessions will then be held in the lab to provide detailed instruction on how to use BSI to support the existing workflow. The launch support phase anticipates a high amount of requests for assistance during the first month of usage. Launch support allows IMS to provide additional help in setting up reports, data entry templates, workflow checklists, requisition templates, etc. 

After the lab is trained, IMS will continue to provide on-site and remote support as requested (maintenance support). Normally the amount of support required decreases as the lab staff becomes accustomed to the BSI interface. This Technical Support will require 860 Labor Hours. 

Implementation at six additional labs

The Contractor will expand the number of labs currently using BSI. This assumes an introduction to BSI, workflow gathering & documentation, repository/user setup, and training for lab. This Implementation at six additional labs will require 556 Labor Hours.

Updates and Release Schedule

The Contractor will update the system on a monthly basis for all non-high impact programming changes. High impact modifications (e.g. new modules) will be released on an annual basis. Emergency modifications will be reviewed and addressed within 2-3 business days.

Progress Reports

The Contractor will generate a Monthly Status Report (MSR) summarizing the work performed during the past month. Attached to the progress, IMS will also provide an Excel spreadsheet to track expenses on the contract.  IMS will bill NHLBI with invoices on a four week interval. 

The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation and Price. 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees. Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE<br />DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of DARPA BAA 10-36, CYBER GENOME PROGRAM on February 22, 2010 at the Ballston Hilton, 950 North Stafford Street, Arlington, VA 22203 from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm EST. This is a reschedule of the February 09, 2010 Proposer's Day that was cancelled due to inclement weather. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the CYBER GENOME PROGRAM; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This is the final Proposer's Day for the Cyber Genome Program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />The objective of the Cyber Genome Program is to produce revolutionary cyber defense and investigatory technologies for the collection, identification, characterization, and presentation of properties and relationships from collected digital artifacts of software, data, and/or users to support DoD law enforcement, counter intelligence, and cyber defense teams. Digital artifacts may be collected from live systems (traditional computers, personal digital assistants, and/or distributed information systems such as &lsquo;cloud computers'), from wired or wireless networks, or collected storage media. The format may include electronic documents or software (to include malicious software - malware). The Cyber Genome Program will encompass several program phases and technical areas of interest. Each of the technical areas will develop the cyber equivalent of fingerprints or DNA to facilitate developing the digital equivalent of genotype, as well as observed and inferred phenotype in order to determine the identity, lineage, and provenance of digital artifacts and users.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION Participants who previously registered for the February 09, 2010 Proposers' Day that was cancelled due to inclement weather, will be automatically registered for the new Proposers' Day. The Proposer's Day has reached maximum attendance, so no additional registrations will be accepted. Attendance will be limited to a maximum of three individuals per organization. The Proposers' Day is intended for participants from industry and academia; it is not intended for parties who are not interested in bidding or participating on a bidding team, e.g. the public or members of the press. Government attendees will be invited separately. Organizations interested in participating in the program who are not able to attend the Proposers' Day, may still register on the teaming website: http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams.</p>
<p>Attendance is restricted to US Citizens only. Attendees are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference. If an attendee previously submitted a citizenship form, a new one does not need to be submitted. The completed Citizenship Form must be emailed to: DARPA-BAA-10-36 no later than 5:00 pm EST February 19, 2010. The Citizenship Form is available for download at the registration website. Attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event. Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.</p>
<p>Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so. Presentations may contain 5 slides and are limited to fifteen (15) minutes each (including logistical issues). Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact DARPA-BAA-10-36 as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers' Day Conference. All previously scheduled presentations from the February 09, 2010 Proposers' Day will be transferred to this Proposers' Day.</p>
<p>All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager. The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.</p>
<p>After the conference, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with Dr. Michael VanPutte, the Cyber Genome Program Manager. Please email your request to DARPA-BAA-10-36@darpa.mil to schedule an individual session. All previously scheduled meetings from the February 09, 2010 Proposers' Day will transfer to this Proposer's Day.</p>

<DESC>The following questions are clarified as follows:

Question 16: Non-conforming items are defined as items/tires that do not comply with the technical requirements/specifications of the individual tire and could also include tires damaged during transit prior to customer acceptance. If your return policy is different for these warranty-type issues versus a shipment error, please specify such in your response.

Question 22: The question is asking whether there is a minimum number of each type of tire (NSN) that your firm will permit to be placed on an individual delivery order under any resulting long term contract.  If a factor in your minimum delivery order quantity decision, assume delivery is within CONUS via FOB Destination.

Question 24: It is acceptable to indicate whether you have the production capacity to meet the ADQ + surge, rather than a specific quantity. 

Please submit any updates to your original response no later than close of
business, February 19, 2010."

<DESC>***THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE OF THIS ANNOUCEMENT TO FEBRUARY 22, 2010 AT 8:00 am, EASTERN STANDARD TIME. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

Request for Information
                  
A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Request for Information (RFI) regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This announcement is a RFI for planning purposes only.

The intent of this RFI is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a  large business, total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc.  This notice is a RFI for all interested qualified businesses that meet the requirements for this effort. Small businesses are highly encouraged to respond.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  


B.  Project Background:

Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest.  While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources are used, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research.  CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings.  For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations. 
As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals.  The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed.  The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient.  
A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes.  Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.  
The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance.  These data are an invaluable resource for CER.  Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector.  As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data; and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical. 

C. Objective:
The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with centers residing outside of the FDA who have medical, biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. These centers will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets.  As part of this effort these Centers will conduct analyses on defined datasets including datasets previously developed as part the joint Janus initiative, where Center specific questions will drive the data transformed, standardized and loaded into the Janus data warehouse.   Additionally, PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops that address issues such as methods for cross-study and other comparative analyses, best practices in CER, and candidate studies and their design and analysis methods. These strategies will also encompass clinical trial designs that can help advance personalized medicine and health outcomes both within and outside of the FDA.
The Government intends on using a contract or contract(s) to establish two PACES Centers, each through a separate contract (or set of task orders) awarded to potentially two different Contractors. Each Contractor will establish a PACES Center to develop and use advanced computational strategies and tools to conduct CER.  Using CER methodologies, these Centers will address potential uses of large FDA datasets as well as or in conjunction with health outcomes data from other sources.  In addition, the Centers will help to develop innovative clinical trial design and data analysis strategies that can be used by the Government to facilitate prospective studies that incorporate CER and personalized medicine approaches.  
The PACES Centers will provide scientific training and collaboration to benefit future FDA-CER efforts and enhance academic capacity and expertise in product related data.  These training efforts will promote collaborative interactions with FDA scientific staff including support of Postdoctoral Fellows both within the FDA and the PACES Centers; exchanges of scientific personnel between the FDA and the PACES Centers; and the sharing of collaborative studies, including potential joint manuscripts for publication of findings to benefit the medical and scientific community.  Furthermore, the PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops to develop their plans for CER, and to discuss computational strategies developed and the findings from their analyses. This is a new requirement.

<DESC>Introduction
This announcement constitutes the annual posting of BAA, HQ0147-09-ATI-BAA as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016(c).  The original announcement language is included below. 

Original Posted Information
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack.  The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  Technical advancement is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Director, Advanced Technology (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS.  This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.

MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Program to identify and develop innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  ATI is a competitive, science and technology research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."

The MDA contracts with private industry, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research in those areas covered in this BAA.  Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract.  MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards, however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Chester Nolf, MDA/DVI; 256-955-5194, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a concept paper or proposal in response to this BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.  Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contracts are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2009 through FY 2010. 

Research Topics
MDA/DV is interested in Advanced Technology Development (ATD) research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment.

Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete.  If selected for award MDA will request additional technical and detailed cost proposal information as listed in the attached proposal instructions paragraphs 6 and 7.  DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.

The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict.  Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  

The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e).  The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows: 

EVALUATION FACTORS 
MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation: 

(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; 
(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; 
(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; 
(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; 
(5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and

Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.

The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror’s proposal:

(1)  The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; 
(2)  The offerors’ capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and 
(3)  The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk;  
(4)  Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.  

No further evaluation criteria will be used.  The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of ATD for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until February 25, 2011 and will be reposted in 2010.  Submittals will be accepted on a continual basis throughout the entire period of time the BAA is open.  

Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).

<DESC>Questions and Answers for the Next Generation Metal Forming System Solicitation (submitted on 2/17/2010):

1.	 With reference to the Biaxial extensometer, paragraph 3.1.8.  The spec calls for a biaxial extensometer with a strain range of +/- 50%.  While a range of +50% is no problem, a strain value of -50% is not practical for a standard extensometer.  -10% is typical.  A -50% range would be special design, and quite expensive.  Can we get a confirmation on the actual expected plastic strain range in compression ?

Reply to question 1:  The vendor's observation is valid, and we would not expect to be taking this system into compression more than 10% because of expected buckling of the sample.  

2.	Secondly, previous discussions with the users, along with the existing Hi-Rate system we are working on for NIST, requires that the successful vendor supply the systems called out on the RFQ (X-ray diffraction system and non-contacting camera strain system) and coordinate the installation and training of these systems.  It is not clear reading the RFQ that we would be responsible for doing the installation, training, and warranty of these systems or that we would just coordinate these services with those equipment suppliers.  This makes a difference in that we are not familiar with the installation and training of these systems and if we had to, the systems would have to be marked up instead of being “passed thru” for the prices quoted originally to the user.  

Reply to question 2:  It is expected that the main contractor would simply coordinate the services of their sub-suppliers in terms of installation, training and warranty.  It is expected that the subs would provide these actual services.

CONTRACT INFORMATION</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">a. General</strong>: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) staffing support for Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />The proposed A-E contract will primarily support the engineering/design of various projects primarily located in the Fort Worth District Offices located in Ft Worth, TX CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This announcement is open to businesses regardless of size. Contract Award Procedure: If a large business firm is selected for this announcement it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are: (1) at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with women-owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least .9% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned SDVOSB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB. The plan is not required as part of this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal if a large firm is selected for negotiations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The prime A-E may rely on the written representation (self certification) of subcontractors regarding small disadvantaged business status.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Anticipated contract award will be on or about May, 2010. One Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $25,000,000 with a Minimum Guarantee amount of $5,000.00 for the Base period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be a base period of 2 years with one option for a 3 year period.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />There will be NO design services included in this contract that the AE firm will provide as an A-E firm in their offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design will be accomplished by the individuals hired under this contract and will be working in the Corps of Engineers offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a staffing contract, not a design contract.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />b.

<DESC>This Task Order is for Project 972013, Recovery Repair Base Supply, Bldgs. 31, 376, and 1007 at Naval Air Station (NAS) Joint Reserve Base (JRB) New Orleans, LA.  Existing areas affected are; 1. First Floor - Within an approximate existing 18,775sf area consisting of mostly open concrete floor space, renovate/construct approximately 9,600sf with new offices/admin space including elevator, restrooms, locker rooms, classroom, break room and other spaces required by the LANG in accordance with the Building Requirements set forth in the RFP.  2. Second Floor - Within an approximate 18,000sf existing area that mainly consists of existing mezzanine and open space below, renovate/construct approximately 5,400sf with new conference room, offices, restrooms, training facilities, climate controlled storage and other  spaces required by the LANG in accordance with the Building Requirements set forth in the RFP.  This includes demolition of existing storage racks and upstairs office areas and potential renovation of existing mezzanine decking.
The estimated value is between $3,500,000 and $4,500,000.  The design and construction schedule is 380 calendar days, which includes the initial fifteen days to allow for mailing of the contract award, submission and approval of required bonding and insurance, etc.  If an earlier completion time is proposed, that schedule will be used to calculate contract completion and will be rated more favorably in the evaluation of the proposal.
The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to use a tradeoff process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS) is responsible for providing health care services to over one million American Indians and Alaska Natives on Indian Reservations located in 33 states of the United States. In October 2008, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) notified the IHS Division of Information Security of a cyber intrusion of the IHS network. An investigation revealed several vulnerabilities with IHS’ current Virtual Private Network (VPN) system. Implementing a secure VPN solution, as recommended by the OIG, will significantly improve the IHS security posture and strengthen operational reliability of the IHS enterprise network. There are no other related projects at this time.

This project is to acquire the necessary training required for the use of the hardware and software solution using the AEP Networks Netilla appliances which provides a secure client/server-side remote network access application, encrypted communication between workstations and servers, and server and authentication hardware (Netilla from AEP Networks) capable of supporting secure VPN communications.

AEP Network 5 - Day On - Site Netilla Product Training was purchased.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs and position work barges.  2)  The contractor is already making extensive repairs on the spillway and is already re-painting the spillway gates.  It would impossible for a different contractor to work over the top of the existing contractor.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed.     <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>
