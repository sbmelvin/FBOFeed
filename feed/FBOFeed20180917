<DESC>SYNOPSIS 
Annual Subscription to Americas Biofuels for EPA NVFEL
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to purchase 3 subscriptions with the option to extend 1 subscription for 4 additional years to the Argus Americas Biofuels ¿ Desktop Access.  The OAR NVFEL SACO anticipates awarding a single firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to Argus Media, Inc. EPA has identified Argus Media, Inc. as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement. 

EPA¿s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program contains a trading and banking component for units of compliance called Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). These RINs are traded on the open market; a unique price is attached to each batch of RINs that are traded. The EPA does not track these prices on the open market, and the EPA needs to subscribe to services such as Argus that collect and report out on this price information to its subscribers. This service also provides other information such as batch volumes and conventional fuel and feedstock spreads that help the EPA better understand the functioning markets as we implement the RFS program.

Argus Media is the only known source to collect and report out on price information to its subscribers such as batch volumes and conventional fuel and feedstock spreads that can help EPA better understand the functioning markets. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This procurement will be conducted utilizing The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519130 ¿ Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals with a size standard of 1,000 employees

Minimum Requirements

¿	Information on batch volumes, conventional fuel, and feedstock spreads
¿	Unlimited historical data contained in the Argus database 
¿	Data collected allowed to be used in aggregated form, such as charts, in calculations, etc., in public documents.


This procurement will be accomplished under the simplified and commercial item procedures under FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soldiers stationed at Fort Wainwright, Alaska - including 4,607 Soldiers assigned to 1/25 SBCT - endure some of the harshest winter conditions of any post in the Army, with winter temperatures commonly dipping below- 40 F.</p>
<p>Army regulations require Soldiers to be physically fit at all times. Physical fitness is directly tied to a unit's readiness and its ability to accomplish its wartime mission. Conducting physical fitness during winter months poses several hazards and risks. USARAK Policy #0-14 states</p>
<p>Version - February 2017 Page <strong>2 </strong>of <strong>5 </strong>Source Selection Information See FAR 2.101 and 3.104</p>
<p>that at temperatures of below -25F, units should conduct short runs or alternate forms of aerobic exercise, which ates the requirement for indoor physical fitness facilities.</p>
<p>There are currently two indoor physical fitness facilities on Fort Wainwright, however the installation has a sixty-t,housand square feet deficit of combat readiness training facility space and forty five-thousand deficit of indoor running track space to support its population. During periods of severe cold in the winter months, these facilities become extremely crowded during PT hours, making it nearly impossible to conduct effective strength or cardiovascular training.</p>
<p>To address this deficiency, 1/25 SBCT has submitted a request through the Defense Logistics Agency to purchase cardiovascular and strength training</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis of proposed contracting action. The solicitation associated with this notice will not be available until APPROXIMATELY 15 DAYS from the date of this notice. Contractors should not contact the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer seeking the solicitation as it will not be available until APPROXIMATELY 15 DAYS after this notice. However, this is a commercial item/service acquisition and therefore, the Contracting Officer may establish a shorter period than 15 days for issuance of the solicitation if needed. The solicitation will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities; the Government-wide point of entry. Please continue to monitor FBO for updates.
<p>This acquisition will be solicited using the sole source authority at FAR 6.302-1; all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency. In the case of this non-competitive acquisition, the intended source of the award is Logistics Health Incorporated (LHI). LHI has the knowledge, expertise, capability, and capacity to provide support during the duration of the RHRP-2 Bridge without a loss of efficiency and without an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the DoD's needs, which would impact both the DHA and supported Service Components (SCs) current operations. The ability for any other vendor to perform the current requirements in the time, quantity, and locations across the 50 States, four U.S. Territories and select overseas locations to meet SCs' demand starting 1 Dec 2018 is judged to be severely limited and would result in substantial risk and possible mission failure on the DoD RHRP. LHI already has the trained personnel, data systems and logistical infrastructure that would be exceptionally hard to duplicate without extensive cost to the government or result in significant delays by a new vendor.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to award a firm fixed price contract utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, contracting by negotiation procedures, pursuant to Part 12, Commercial Items. The period of performance will be a 6 month base period and will include up to 6 additional months of performance in accordance with FAR 52-217-8. The NAICS code is 621112.</p>

RHRP services include medical, dental, and behavioral health services essential in maintaining a deployable force. RHRP services include Periodic Health Assessments (PHAs), Pre-Deployment Health Assessment, Post-Deployment Health Reassessments (PDHRA), Mental Health Assessments (MHAs), Separation History and Physical Examinations (SHPE), dental examinations and x-rays, dental treatment, laboratory services, occupational health services, immunizations, physical examinations, audio and vision exams, and other services as required to satisfy SC health readiness needs.<br />17. Place of Contract Performance - RHRP services are provided in the 50 States, the four U.S. Territories, the District of Columbia, and in select overseas locations at SC identified group events (gatherings of Service Members for provision of services face-to-face), at SC designated government sites (e.g., Armories, drill halls), through the Contractor's Call Center, and within the Contractor's network of private sector providers (physician and dentist offices and clinics and individual Health Care Professionals). <br />18.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103.  A protest to ECC-A is a “PROTEST TO THE AGENCY,” within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ECC-A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ECC-A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.

(b)  An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the ECC-A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by ECC-A.  Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:

(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)  The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)  An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.

(c)  An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.

(d) For the purpose of filing a ECC-A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 

(e)  An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the Contracting Officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.

(f)  ECC-A Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from Mrs. Charlene Wilson @ Charlene.wilson.civ@mail.mil

(OCT 2015)

(a)   U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan.  This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts – including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site.  A commander’s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agency’s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision.

<SUBJECT>NASA GSFC PHASE E EXTENSION TO NNG11PA03C WITH UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
<SOLNBR>NASA-GSFC-PHASE-E-EXTENSION-NNG11PA03C-UNH
<RESPDATE>100218
<CONTACT>Naimah K.  Bhuruku, Contracting Officer, Phone 3012862028, Email naimah.bhuruku@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract <br />NNG11PA03C with the University of New Hampshire (UNH) to continue the flight operations and science analyses of the LRO/CRaTER instrument, which is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument, aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. UNH is currently performing both the instrument operations, which includes instrument operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations which includes initiating all calibration requests to the instrument, planning all instrument modes and turn-ons, data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS).
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to UNH. The estimated period of performance of this cost-no-fee (CNF) contract extension will be for one (1) year from March 16, 2019 through March 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Currently, UNH is the only organization qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons: Only UNH possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed design, test and operations knowledge of the CRaTER instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to integrate the CRaTER calibration, science operations and science data analysis. This is essential because the majority of the Instrument calibration and science operations flow from the science data analysis and require knowledge of both the Instrument science and Instrument design, test and operation. Similarly, the science data analysis is enhanced by direct knowledge of the Instrument science operations. It would be unproductive to separate science operations from science data analysis. UNH scientists and engineers are unique in their familiarity with the CRaTER instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft. From 2005-2009, the UNH team (then resident at BU) designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the CRaTER instrument for the LRO spacecraft, including at the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO. Under contract NNG05EB92C, the UNH team (while at BU and now UNH) successfully carried out the science operations of the CRaTER instrument on the LRO spacecraft since launch in June 2009. The current Principal Investigator, Dr. Nathan Schwadron, of UNH, a leading expert in the field of space physics, was selected to replace Dr. Spence with NASA's approval when Dr. Spence was promoted to the Director of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at UNH. Dr. Spence had been chosen by NASA Headquarters to lead the original investigation, based on an evaluation of his proposal submitted under Announcement of Opportunity for exploration measurements in NASA's LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O). The CRaTER instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument. In addition, UNH unique developed software for: checking telemetry received for health and safety of the instruments, processing the raw data so that scientists can manipulate, display, and analyze the scientific data received, and producing summary data. This effort requires the detailed understanding of the instrument and all related software. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 27 September 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

Background
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to purchase earthquake and volcano monitoring systems, including integrated systems (containing both sensors and data acquisition units (DAUs)) and systems comprised of separate DAUs and sensors (either strong motion sensors or broadband sensors).  This equipment will be used in the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), the Global Seismographic Network (GSN), and the USGS Volcano Program to serve the needs of earthquake and volcano monitoring, engineering, and research communities as well as national, state, and local governments, emergency response organizations, and the general public.  Applications of these devices may include urban and rural free-field and reference sites, and other types of networks, such as volcano monitoring and broadband networks.

<p>Location: USACE, Louisville District</p>
<p>Title: TAM AE Design Services-Small Business for projects within the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) boundaries of the USACE Transatlantic Middle East District.</p>
<p>Description(s): <br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The proposed IDIQ is to provide A-E services including all phases of design of renovation and new construction; from planning through preparation of final design/build packages and design/bid/build construction documents. Elements include, but are not limited to, project design, quality control, site investigations (topographic surveys, geotechnical subsurface investigations, environmental testing, and as-built research), planning and programming documentation, transportation planning, force protection, life safety, infrastructure investigation and design, Title II design support during construction, and subject matter expert support for all Transatlantic Middle East District (TAM) stakeholders throughout the CENTCOM AOR and for our Worldwide customers. Preparation of design and construction documents incorporating applicable Unified Facility Criteria (UFCs), international codes, and local codes in the countries within the CENTCOM AOR (design standards, expectations, and culture). The CENTCOM AOR has 20 nations, which stretches from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District Contracting Division (LDCD) intends to award in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6, up to two (2), A-E Design Services SATOCs set aside to small businesses, with an estimated overall capacity of $10 million. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. See Paragraphs 3 and 4 for general information on the A-E selection process. Up to two awards may be issued up to one year from the date of the release of this FBO announcement. The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years. Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. There is no minimum or maximum on the amount of individual task orders, except the overall contract value will not be exceeded. The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to expend capacity in advance of the contract maximum period as necessary to meet operational needs.</p>
<p>Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract." Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. Projected contract award date is March 2019 for the initial one-year period. It is the Government's intent to make a minimum of one and maximum of two contract awards under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs. Work will be issued by task order, either cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-price or labor-hour. It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed among the design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. TAM's AOR has traditionally paralleled the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Middle East, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa. TAM's mission has further expanded to include several new worldwide programs, including the Center of Standardization for Contingency Standard Designs, the Technical Center of Expertise for Aircraft Hangar Fire Protection, and Satellite Communications. Based on TAM's newly acquired missions, it is projected that the Design Services Architect-Engineer Contracts will include all locations where TAM has been designated program manager. While the primary focus of this contract will be on work within the CENTCOM region, the A-E firm must be able to perform work throughout TAM's AOR, including the locations for TAM's newly acquired worldwide missions. The A-E firm must be willing to service locations worldwide including performing site visits. The A-E firm will be required to perform work in all countries located within TAM's Area of Responsibility (CENTCOM). The A-E Firm will need a working understanding of all International Codes, Host Nation Requirement (design, construction and permitting) requirements, Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), etc. as well as extensive knowledge of the UFCs. The incumbent's understanding of cultural as well will be considered in the selection process as well. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM internet site at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>NOTE: All firms shall be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf.

Local Exchange Carrier Services for 
Hines Information Technology Center in Hines, Illinois
VA118-15-C-0133 P00005

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Procurement, Acquisition, and Logistics (OPAL), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to modify existing contract VA118-15-C-0133 to extend the period of performance by three months to maintain Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) Services for the Hines Information Technology Center in Hines, Illinois while services are transitioned to the National LEC (NLEC) contract.  The TAC intends to award a sole source, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) modification to Granite Telecommunication, LLC. 100 Newport Avenue Ext, Quincy Massachusetts, 02171.

The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled,  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   However, in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  

The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 517911.  The period of performance shall be October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Estimated date of award for this action to extend services is on October 1, 2018. 

The proposed modification is intended to bridge the gap while services on the existing Contract VA118-15-C-0133 are transitioned to the NLEC contract under Task Order.  VA anticipates the bridge extension associated with attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) to be on a sole source basis to the incumbent contractor Granite Telecommunications to ensure continuity of services and the ability to provide telecommunication voice services for the Hines Information Technology Center in Hines, Illinois, inclusive of dial tone lines, integrated services digital network primary rate interface and basic rate access, Direct Inward Dialing traffic, foreign and domestic directory listing services, and digital subscriber line internet connectivity.  The contractor is responsible for ensuring the current infrastructure remains consistent.  The Contractor shall continue to provide telecommunication voice services at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week with maximum service availability such that no break in telephone services shall occur in accordance with the draft PWS.  The Government believes that only Granite Telecommunications is capable of providing the current level of support for the three months due to the following reasons:

Due to construction requirements, build outs, and site coordination, these services have yet to be completely transitioned from Granite Telecommunication.  Loss of existing services would result in disruptions of service of communications systems and life sustaining medical systems, the inability to share resources within the Veterans Integrated Service Network, increased maintenance time, increased system blockages, and reduced computer access to patient record databases.  The three months option provides continuity of services for the effort;  
Due to the type of telecommunication services, to introduce yet another vendor to install, test and provide new services during the current transition would provide for an unacceptably high level of risk to performance and schedule.  Furthermore, interoperability of the systems, testing and release synchronization would be difficult to achieve and manage. VA local IT departments lack the personnel support to complete multiple transitions.  Specifically, any other source would have to conduct site visits at the required locations and conduct extensive reviews of the specific site to gain the knowledge required to begin the process of creating an environment that is needed to provide the aforementioned services to VA.  In addition, a new vendor would have to conduct testing to ensure the service is fully compliant with VA s current environment before it can be implemented.  The current LEC telecommunication voice and data services with Granite Telecommunication will have to be maintained until the current transition is fully completed.

This notification shall close on September 19, 2018 at 12 PM EST.  Questions/responses shall be submitted via email to the Points of Contact (POCs) for this action: Keiahna Brewer, Contract Specialist at Keiahna.Brewer@va.gov  or Sharon Fernandes, Contracting Officer at Sharon.Fernandes@va.gov with the subject line HITC LEC Extension VA118-15-C-0133 P00005.

Common size configurations include bi-con, tri-con and quad-con sizes (two, three or four smaller, interlocking containers that when combined, have a similar footprint as a larger 40" shipping container.) Collapsible/ Inflatable flat pack shipping containers are also included in the scope of this SIN. Ancillary products or services related to the proper installation, operation, or maintenance of these containers may be purchased under this SIN.</p>

The FEC Lead Unit cannot be replicated to the degree of detail necessary for NSWCPD's purposes, duplicate the shipboard system,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>by another company due to the proprietary equipment and software owned by FEC.<br /><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: "><br />Regarding installation support, FEC is the only company with the exception of the shipbuilder, to install the AWE system. Additionally, the shipbuilder has relied heavily on FEC during installation to align, groom and troubleshoot during the installation. There have been a multitude of complications with the installations of the AWE system on CVN 78, causing major setbacks and delays. FEC has been integral to troubleshooting these issues and providing resolutions. The lessons learned from the initial unit and eleven shipboard system installations and operation have resulted in improved installation procedures. The AWE system has extremely tight tolerances and requires specialized equipment and knowledge to reduce the risk of incurring costly installation and integration errors. FEC is the only vendor that has and continues to acquire the specialized experience and knowledge needed provide the greatest potential for a successful installation and integration.</span></span></span></p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking information on a tool that can be integrated with web based applications for external filers to securely submit their digitally signed non-public filings to the SEC. <br />BACKGROUND<br />The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the commission) currently uses several different applications to track incoming non-public rule filings and outgoing correspondence to the filers. However, these applications have limited interconnectivity between the systems. These applications are built in-house using Java technology and storing the filings/documents and the metadata in a Sybase Database for reporting, reviewing and taking action by the Commission staff.
<p>SCOPE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Commission seeks information regarding an integrated tool that should possess several important functionalities, as outlined below:<br />&bull; The tool shall have digital signature functionality and provide a single interface for users to open, fill out and save form<br />&bull; The tool shall have the capability to lock the forms once digitally signed by a person and shall be editable once unlocked by the person who had signed the form<br />&bull; The tool shall be compatible with IE, Chrome and Edge internet browsers<br />&bull; The tool shall be flexibility so that fillable Forms can be designed using the tool as per current applications requirements <br />&bull; The tool shall allow documents to be attached to the designed forms with different formats e.g. Word, PDF <br />&bull; The data and the documents shall be parsable to the Sybase database <br />&bull; The tool shall allow forms to be saved exactly as they were submitted<br />&bull; The Forms shall be easily embedded within existing applications web sites</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes responses on Commercial-off-the-Shelf products that fulfill the functionality described above so long as they are operational, supported, and well-tested. <br />This RFI reflects the minimum functionality we seek. Respondents are encouraged to provide information on alternative and innovative tools, functions, and designs, particularly if a respondent thinks it would produce superior results. <br />RFI respondents must respond in the form of a Capability Statement that addresses: 1) the product's ability to fulfill the above functionality, 2) provide Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), 3) company's profile and capability in providing these types of tools, if any 4) minimum technical infrastructure requirement that SEC should already possess and 5) pricing for different package offerings 6) and any other relevant information that would enhance the staff's understanding of the information submitted. If all or any portion of the required capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software, please so indicate in your response.<br />This is not a solicitation and is for market research purposes only.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is not a solicitation announcement.   The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Business, HUB Zone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran owned, and Women owned Small Business firms.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the government in making appropriate acquisition decisions.
<p>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers has a need for construction of a reinforced concrete wall at three locations immediately downstream of the Unit 4 intake bulkhead at West Point Power House, West Point, Georgia. The NAICS is 236220, size standard $36.5m.  Each wall is 12'-6" thick, 17' long, and 33' tall.  The wall will be tied to the existing powerhouse structure with steel dowels and two water-stops will be installed to insure water tightness. During construction the temperature of the concrete at the time of placement will not be able to exceed 70 degrees. Additional challenges include the physical location of these walls and the limited access for construction materials. Two water leaks in the existing west intake concrete bulkhead joint will require piping to discharge the water. The rate of leakage is calculated to be approximately 70 to 90 gallons per minute. No debris of any kind will be allowed to be disposed of in the draft tubes during construction.  In order to access Unit 4 intake and redefine the workspace from confined to open, the contractor must remove two pre-stressed double tees that are roughly 8 feet wide by 40 feet long. The contractor shall be responsible for removing the double tees and the construction and subsequent removal of a temporary secondary means of egress.  The existing overhead crane in the powerhouse will be available to move construction materials in and out of the Unit 4 cavity. The crane will be operated by government personnel. The contractor shall coordinate the need for the crane and associated logistics with the powerhouse supervisor at least two days prior to the need. Any powerhouse project or maintenance activity requiring the crane takes precedence over the contractor's use of the crane and cannot be used as the basis of a claim. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract will be awarded based on FAR Part 15 "best value" procedures.</p>
<p>Responses are requested with the following information, which shall not exceed a total of eight pages. 1. Offeror's name, address, points of contact with telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. 2. Business size/classification to include any designations as Small Business, 8(a), HUB Zone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned shall be indicated on first page of submission. 3. Bonding capability (construction bonding level per single contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars; along with current available bonding capacity. 4. Description of capability to perform the proposed construction, manage subcontractors, prepare and comply with various environmental and construction permits, and capacity to execute this project with other ongoing contracts. 5. Past performance/experience on projects of similar scope, describing no more than three (3) projects that are at least 50% construction complete within the past five years of the issue date of this Notice. The past performance information should include project title, location, general description of the construction to demonstrate relevance to the proposed project, the bidder's role, dollar value of contract, and name of the company, agency or government entity for which the work was performed with contact information (reference name, phone number and e-mail address).</p>
<p>NO RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED BY FAX OR MAIL. ALL RESPONSES MUST BE E-MAILED to: CHANDA D. STRENTH at chanda.d.strenth@usace.army.mil.  Submittals are due no later than 02 October 2018.  Submittals will not be returned. Telephonic responses will not be honored.  This is not a Request for Proposal, only a Request for Information.  No award will result from this Sources Sought. This notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>The Government is issuing this Request for Information to determine a competitive basis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This questionnaire is for market research purposes only. Only contractors capable of performing this type of work should respond to this Request for Information.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The Nashville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), anticipates a requirement for a firm fixed-price construction contract for Slide Repair at the Wix-Howard Cemetery in Loyall, Harlan County, KY. The work consists of furnishing all equipment, materials, methods, and labor for performing all operations required for removal of the slide mass, scaling and stabilizing the slope, and placing a rock buttress against the remaining slope. Construction shall include coordination with local utilities companies for removing their existing service.</p>
<p>The diversion channel, earthen embankments, floodwall, and closure structures near Loyall, KY were constructed and completed as part of the Harlan Flood Protection Project in 1999. These construction efforts were the third and final phase of the project. The project was constructed to<br />divert the potentially damaging Cumberland River flows from the town center in Loyall, KY, and also provide protection to Rio Vista. The previous Cumberland River channel is now used for interior drainage purposes during storm events. Recently, a slide developed that is threatening the Wix-Howard Cemetery. This was first observed in February 2016 after several months of significant rainfall. Ground movement of this type is most often triggered by a rising water table, usually caused by rain, increasing hydrostatic forces on a block of rock delineated by discontinuities. Due to these additional forces and the failure plane daylighting in the cut, rock on the face of the diversion channel cut has shifted outward toward the river, and the slide has destabilized a portion of the Wix-Howard Cemetery.</p>
<p>The anticipated NAICS code is 237990: OTHER HEAVY AND CIVIL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION, with a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>Magnitude of Construction: Between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>

This proposed award is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp; The assoicated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Cods is 332999; small business size standard is 750 employees. <br /><br />Justification:<br />The Animal Bioscience and Biotechnology Laboratory (ABBL) will be performing microbiome data analysis which requires weanling piglets to be housed in specialized pens that are elevated to aid in waste reduction. ABBL requires a specialized nursery plastic flooring that promotes waste removal by including 40% open space for waste to fall to the sewer system below. No side slits or holes, so animals cannot cross contaminate between each pen. Crates must allow housing of individual piglets or housing of up to 8 piglets/pen. Due to the specialization and elevation of the cage required to optimize microbiome analysis in piglets the suggested source is the only known available source for these cages.&nbsp;
<p><strong>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</strong>. The government will consider all responsible sources received by the due date. Written responses must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona-fide capability to fulfill the requirement. If no written responses are received, a purchase order will be issued without further notice.</p>

<DESC><strong>Solicitation Number: RFI-AFRL-RIK-18-06</strong>
<p><strong>Notice Type:</strong> Special Notice</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis: </strong> Request for Information (RFI) on Non- Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Communications</p>
<p><strong>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME:</strong> Department of Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p><br /><strong>1.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL INFORMATION</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</strong>.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 FEEDBACK</strong>.  Submission of an abstract is voluntary.  Respondents are advised that AFRL is under no obligation to provide feedback with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 REGULATORY GUIDANCE</strong>.  This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), "RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract."</p>
<p><strong>2,0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</span></strong></p>
<p>The RFI seeks to obtain technical information on the current state-of-the-art and the future development potential for non-SATCOM BLOS technologies (e.g. troposcatter, HF, UAV relays, passive reflector systems, etc.). Further, it seeks to obtain information about current and planned development initiatives, technology maturity, fabrication methods, availability, schedule and cost of such materials for potential use in anticipated military applications.</p>
<p>This announcement is <strong>not</strong> a request for proposals; therefore, responses to the RFI are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The technical information submitted will be part of a collaborative approach and peer review across other services, agencies and federal departments and coalition government partners to ensure appropriate coordination and understanding of interdependencies with relevant defense, homeland security, and intelligence authorities. It will also draw upon the deep knowledge, experience, and capabilities within global industrial and academic centers of gravity.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 3 of this announcement for instructions on submitting a RFI abstract.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>
<p>The focus of this RFI is on the identification of existing technologies and the near to long-term development potential for the next generation of non- Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communication systems. Non-SATCOM BLOS communication systems that exist today include tropospheric scatter and high frequency systems as well as various tethered and untethered unmanned aerial vehicles that act as relays. We are interested in systems that would provide the best redundancy to SATCOM systems in terms of performance characteristics. These systems may include the above mentioned systems as well as less known systems such as passive scatter systems, e.g. aircraft and meteor burst scatter, or an entirely novel idea of achieving BLOS communications. The response should address aspects such as operating distance of each technology, reliability, throughput, latency, time of day and weather dependence, etc.</p>
<p>Discussions incorporating quantifiable justifications are desired. What are the projected timelines to achieve the proposed BLOS communication methods with the identified technologies?</p>
<p><strong>3.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS AND FORMAT</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 SUBMISSIONS DUE DATE:  RFI abstract due date is 17 October 2018.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.2 CONTENT AND FORMAT: </strong></p>
<p><strong>NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RFI RESPONSE. </strong></p>
<p>Submissions should briefly summarize the technical concepts and approaches within a maximum of four pages (as broken down in paragraphs c, d and e below), excluding quad chart, figures, references and the cover page. <br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.	 <strong>Quad Chart </strong>(1 page): The template for this is attached to the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. <strong>Cover Page </strong>(1 page only) which must include: 1) Title; 2) Organization; 3) Respondent's technical and administrative points of contact (names, addresses, phones, and email addresses); and      4) Applicable Core Function(s) for the technology/concept or approach:   (e.g., air, space, cyberspace, C2, ISR, mission support).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. <strong>Executive Summary</strong> (1 page only):  Summarize technical concepts, associated&nbsp; technical challenges as well as approaches to address the enumerated technical challenges.  Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while providing sufficient detail to adequately convey the technical concepts, challenges and approaches.<br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d. <strong>Technology/Concept Description </strong>(2 pages only):  Provide an enhanced view of the technical concepts you are proposing, focusing on the advantages of the technology application and its applicability to the future military needs, indicating the technology maturity and timeline for initial operational capability.  The description of each solution should include the current state of development and the predicted performance levels the technology should reasonably achieve.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>The Reference Number is FA441818Q0041. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intends to award a sole source contract for the preventive and corrective maintenance of Access Control Systems for Joint Base Charleston Air Base Fitness Centers (FAC). <br />The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Smartnet Inc. 211 Edwards Ferry Rd Leesburg, VA 20176. Market research was conducted and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.<br />In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c)(15)(ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:<br />In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:<br />(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC<br />(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.<br />(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide preventive and corrective maintenance for the existing access card control system. <br />(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) Only one source is capable of providing the required product due to Smartnet Inc. being the only vendor with an Air Force (AF) Platform Information Technology (PIT) certification which is required for access system used in the FAC.<br />(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The existing system utilizes proprietary Smartnet Inc. products. Smartnet Inc. is currently the only vendor with an AF Platform Information Technology (PIT) certification. The Smartnet Inc. software used to register, track, suspend, and delete data from the system is proprietary cannot be copied or used with other systems.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.<br />(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous awards made for the same service.<br />(8) Description of market research: Smartnet 24/7 FAC was researched and purchased by AF Strategic Business Systems and Initiatives Division and installed in 70 AF FACs throughout the Department of Defense. AF Services Agency, the AF Strategic Business Systems and Initiatives Division and the Administering Contracting Officer of an existing Non Appropriated Funds Contract were contacted to determine whether any other vendors had obtained the required PIT certification. It was confirmed that Smart Net remains the only company with the AF PIT certification and they are the only company available to perform the required installation.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: Smartnet access system was researched and purchased by AF Strategic Business Systems and Initiatives Division and installed in 70 AF Fitness Centers throughout the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: N/A</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />Upon expiration of current contract, the requirement owner will research and consider 'or equal systems' in the marketplace to maximize competition.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.<br />Address questions to Brandy Stroud, Contract Specialist, at (843) 963-5166, email brandy.stroud@us.af.mil and Laurie Richman, Contracting Officer, Phone (843) 963-3337, email laurie.richman@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE - SAGE GROUSE LIVESTOCK MONITORING

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC) in coordination with the BLM Cody Field Office, hereby provides notice of its intent to award a Sole Source, firm fixed price contract to Oregon State University. The contract is expected to be awarded under FAR Part 13. A Limited Sources Justification has been prepared. 

The contract will be for Oregon State University (OSU) to provide research effort to identify potential mechanisms influencing sage-grouse habitat use and demographic rates related to operational ranching and predator management. Unlike other monitoring efforts, this project seeks to identify positive benefits for domestic livestock production and wildlife.

NAICS code: 541620, Environmental Consulting Services (SBA Size Standard $15.0 Million)

Description: BLM has identified five years of existing data sets owned by Oregon State University (OSU) and the United States Department of Agriculture - National Wildlife Research Center (USDA NWRC).  These data sets will be invaluable to BLM and available for use at no cost.  OSU and USDA NWRC own the right to this data and as such the data is proprietary. 

The Bighorn Basin project with broader applicability in sagebrush habitat, titled Interactive Effects of Predators, Habitat, and Livestock Presence on Sage-grouse Demography in Wyoming was designed with local entities to meet multiple Agency and commercial needs.
 
The existing data on seasonal sage-grouse movement and habitat use in the Bighorn Basin, 2011-2014, will be integrated into BLM's project. By leveraging this existing dataset, the BLM will gain seasonal habitat maps over a large spatial and temporal extent at an estimated cost savings of $750,000 (including multi-season location and demographic data).
This Bighorn Basin is an OSU and USDA's project, and the BLM has an opportunity to join in the research study to gain additional knowledge and products at zero expense to the government. The existing proprietary five years of data would be used in the BLM proposed study. 

This award will be issued so BLM can contribute with OSU and USDA for additional three year of data collection. This will allow BLM to receive the benefits of eight years of data collection and analysis. 

The next 3 years of data collection and analysis would include supplies and services as listed below: 
 -One graduate student will produce a thesis and at least 2 peer-reviewed manuscripts focused on seasonal habitat use and demography of sage-grouse
 -One technician dedicated to supporting field work
 -Project supervision and input from 2 sage-grouse/predator experts
 -40 VHF sage-grouse collars and associated telemetry equipment 
 -Eight winter flights to map sage-grouse habitat use over two years 
 -50 cattle GPS collars
 -Two 4WD field vehicles for operations
 -Field gear including capture equipment, notebooks, binoculars, rangefinders, handheld GPS, hand tools, etc. 
 -Trail cameras with still and video capabilities
 -Sage-grouse seasonal movement data including winter 
 -Sage-grouse seasonal habitat maps, including winter, generated from existing (2011-2014) and new (2019-2021) data as a part of the monitoring 
 -Assessment of seasonal survival and reproductive rates of sage-grouse 
 -GIS layers of habitat characteristics (e.g., proportion cropland, forest, burned area, etc.) and anthropogenic features (e.g., roads, power lines, energy development, etc.)
 -Estimates of avian and mammalian predator densities 
 -Vegetation sampling at sage-grouse reproductive sites, livestock use areas, and random areas
 -All habitat use and demographic analyses conducted with rigorous statistical analyses 
 -Annual reports for each year of monitoring

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement no later than September 24, 2018, 10:00 AM, MT. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The BLM NOC shall NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice of intent. Only written responses will be considered. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this notice of intent, the Government shall determine if a solicitation will be issued. Any prospective contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award.
 
Interested parties are encouraged to furnish information by email only with Response to Intent to Sole Source 140L0618R0106 for SAGE GROUSE LIVESTOCK MONITORING in the subject line. All documents submitted will not be returned. All interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed to Maeghann L. Dale by email at mdale@blm.gov. The capability documentation should include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective contractor's capabilities and experience that will demonstrate the ability to support this requirement.

If no responses are received, within 7 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.

Also, for the smallwares portion, (mugs, bowls, etc.) do those need to be delivered by the person doing the installation, or can they be drop shipped directly to you?  
Government   The items listed in the solicitation attachment (Salient Characteristics List) that comprise the Food Service Meal Delivery Tray and POD Systems are to be installed per SOW. 

There was a site visit scheduled on Sep 10, 2018 in order for all potential contractors to see the existing equipment, and familiarize themselves with what the requirements are for the work to be completed. Unfortunately, I do not have a list of all existing equipment, so am unable to provide a specific answer to your question.

With respect to the service ware, the installers do not need to deliver these items; however, the items must be in place in order to test the equipment upon installation.

<strong>Synopsis:&nbsp;</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.<strong> NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong>
<div><strong><br />THE TECHNOLOGY:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong>Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a flexible, light weight and portable thermal protection system. The flexible thermal protection systems are multilayer thermal blankets that are designed to handle external temperatures of up to 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight tests clearly demonstrate how these new heat retardant materials can protect from the extreme conditions. This system creates an environment for protecting equipment, facilities, and people from a high intensity incident heat source, such as a fire. The system can be formed as a sleeping bag, a tent, a blanket, a vertical barrier, a curtain, a flexible rollup doorway, or a wrap.
<div><br />NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent Pending.
<div><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company.  Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/
<div><br />These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice. </strong><br /> <br /></div>

<DESC><div><strong>SYNOPSIS: <br /></strong></div>
<div>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) hereby provides notice of its intent to award a sole-source, firm fixed price purchase order to Curt. W. Reimann, 23619 Peach Tree Rd, Clarksburg, MD 20871-9119. The order is expected to be awarded under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) works as a catalyst to strengthen American manufacturing. Through a nationwide network of centers, MEP provides manufacturers with access to a wealth of tools, techniques and other resources. With services ranging from growth strategies, to process improvements, to green manufacturing, MEP offers tools, solutions, and resources to address manufacturers' diverse challenges and opportunities. To support the mission of the program, MEP participates in several outreach events each year to strengthen public knowledge of MEP's benefit to American small and medium-sized enterprises Subject Matter Experts (SME).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a sole source requirement for Curt W. Reimann to provide expertise in generating and implementing manufacturing research agenda information and assistance with identifying sources appropriate for conducting studies of manufacturing, manufacturers and MEP Centers.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>To further succeed in its mission, MEP requires expertise in creating and implementing a manufacturing research agenda, along with assistance with identifying appropriate sources of data and analyses; determining which sources are useful for which purposes; conducting appropriate studies of manufacturing, manufacturers, and MEP Centers; developing training related to the use of such data and studies.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Dr. Curt Reimann shall assist in the development of the manufacturing research agenda; identification of sources of data and analyses; development of a framework for coordination between, use and sharing of data and analyses by multiple NIST MEP divisions and groups, as well as by MEP Centers; identification of any needed training of NIST MEP and/or MEP Center staff; and communications strategies for increasing the awareness and dissemination of data and analyses to NIST MEP staff and MEP Centers. Dr. Reimann's extensive experience and past work with MEP and the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Program over the past decade make him uniquely qualified to understand the needs of the MEP National Network and the types of research and data that will be required to strengthen and improve the data and knowledge available to the Network and the means by which it is shared among the various parties within the Network to improve their utilization of it.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Curt W. Reimann is the sole provider of expertise and knowledge specific to the development of the manufacturing research agenda, identification of sources of data and analyses, development of a framework for coordination between use and sharing of data and analyses by multiple NIST MEP divisions and groups, as well as by MEP Centers; and communications strategies for increasing the awareness and dissemination of data and analyses to NIST MEP staff and MEP Centers. The learning curve of another vendor would create a significant delay in developing and implementing a research agenda, consistent with the Baldridge framework and criteria. Given the speed at which new technologies are impacting U.S. manufacturers, such a delay would have a negative impact on progress of the program and would delay requiring necessary information and implementing recommendations based on that information.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NIST will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice of intent. Only written responses will be considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this notice of intent, the Government shall determine whether a solicitation will be issued. Any prospective contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award. Information concerning SAM registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://sam.gov.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong><br /></div>
<div>All interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed above to Chantel Adams by email at chantel.adams@nist.gov, no later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, September 21, 2018. Fax inquiries will not be accepted. The capability documentation should include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective contractor's capabilities and experience that will demonstrate the ability to support these requirements.<br /></div>

<DESC>Synopsis: Notice of Intent To Award A Sole-Source Contract<br />Announcement Number: 1305M2-18-00999<br />Project Title: EdgeOne Mechanical Power Switches for the 8242XS Acoustic Releases
<p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with EdgeOne Solutions, Inc., using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to purchase Edge One mechanical power switches for the 8242 Acoustic Releases to support the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean array of buoys (TAO) and TSUNAMI programs. Currently the field service technicians must open the pressure housings on the releases on the deck of a ship to plug in batteries to prevent the batteries from discharging before the end of a deployment. Opening the pressure housing could potentially cause the O-rings to foul or become damaged which could cause the releases to get water inside or more dramatically to implode under pressure. With these switches the releases can be leak tested and purged with dry nitrogen in the National Data Buoy Center laboratory and the field service personnel only have to mechanically rotate the switch to active the power. The Edge One switch is the only commercially manufactured drop-in switch for this application. Use of another manufactures switch voids the EdgeOne warranty. The switches are designed to work with the 8242Xs pressure housing, printed circuit boards, and power connectors. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334511, Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance with a business size standard of 1250 Employees.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes, nor will one be posted on FedBizOpps.</p>

<SOLNBR>140P6218R0023
<CONTACT>Logsdon, Kathryn
<DESC>The National Park Service, MWR Missouri Major Acquisition Buying Office (MO-MABO) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement action to Wood Ronsaville and Harlin Inc. (WRH) for full-color illustrations to depict site specific, Civil War era stories that have never before been depicted.  The illustrations will be used on wayside exhibits placed at locations related to significant stories along the Park's tour road located at Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, Republic, MO.

Wilson's Creek National Battlefield conducted competitive procurements for wayside exhibit illustrations along the tour road in past years whereby WRH was the successful offeror.  In keeping with the same illustrative concept, design, style, and artistic medium as the existing wayside exhibit illustrations, and to bring continuity and realism to the visitor's experience, it is in the best interest of the Government to continue this collection by using the same WRH artist who prepared the existing Tour Road illustrations.  The illustrator has subject matter expertise in Civil War stories and material culture and has specialized skills in depicting national park stories, especially military stories, with a style that engages visitors and immerses them in the action being depicted.  More explicit detail of the rationale for this sole-source action is set forth in the J&A for Other than Full and Open Competition which is included with this Notice.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Treatment of poly-traumatic injuries using platel
<SOLNBR>N00014-18-RFI-0014
<CONTACT>Lee, Phillip
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research, Code 34, requests information on specific capabilities to support an initiative to develop advanced technologies for treating poly-traumatic injuries using Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC).  Poly-traumatic injuries, which include hemorrhagic shock, as well as soft tissue and musculoskeletal damage, remain a leading cause of potentially survivable mortality in the military and civilian sectors.  The increasing use of explosive devices in combat has contributed to a rise in severe poly-traumatic injuries as explosions were the cause for 72% of those who died of wounds during Operations Iraqi Freedom / Enduring Freedom.  Mortality is influenced by injury, severity, blood loss, and resulting pathophysiologic derangements such as metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and maladaptive immune responsiveness. Studies show 25% of potentially survivable deaths during the above conflicts was due to extensive blood loss.  In addition, ACL injuries among U.S. military service members are estimated to occur at a rate 10 times higher than for the U.S. population as a whole. Since these injuries generally affect young, active individuals, the long-term impact of early-onset osteoarthritis is of great concern for the active and veteran military populations. The leading cause of disability for active military is musculoskeletal injuries– with disorders of the knee as one of the highest causes of long term dysfunction.

(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K)


This requirement is to provide VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS) with annual technical research services from the University of Washington NW BioTrust under merit review. The following tasks will be performed at the NW BioTrust Laboratory: 

Task
Description
Quantity
1
Process and embed mouse brain to create a brain block
500
2
Trim and cassette spinal cord
75
3
Process and embed spinal cord to create a spinal cord block
75


Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used: 
NW Biotrust/ UWMC Anatomic Pathology uses an automated high throughput embedding process that provides a high level of paraffin embedding quality control due to their ability to run the large numbers needed to statistically show reproducible results. Differences in quality affect the results obtained for Kraemer Lab immunohistochemistry experiments.  Kraemer lab also uses paraffin embedded human brain tissue from NW Biotrust/ UWMC Anatomic Pathology for these studies.  They make direct comparisons of results obtained with this human tissue and tissue from our mouse models.  Any differences in processing between the tissue types would confound these analyses. 

The total estimated value of the proposed action is $47,818.75 with a period of performance 9/01/2018   08/31/2019 and four option years.

<DESC><div><strong>JUSTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FOR INCREASE OF IDIQ MAXIMUM CONTRACT VALUE</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></div>
<div><strong></strong><br />On January 25th, 2013, the General Services Administration Region 1 Acquisition Division issued Solicitation Number GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0003, which requested proposals for the provision of Construction Services for the General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Region 1, Boston Service Center. The services required would provide for the award of individual Delivery Orders for the execution of various construction projects in the Boston Service Center area of responsibility, namely, all federally-owned and leased buildings in the Metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts area.</div>
<p>The successful awardees would provide all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, supervision, disposal and all other costs necessary to fulfill the requirements of each individual Delivery Order awarded to it. The type of work envisioned under the resulting contract included, but was not limited to, general construction, demolition (including asbestos abatement), carpentry/finishing, electrical, general functions, plumbing and pipefitting, HVAC and mechanical, roofing, fire suppression systems, etc. The resulting contract periods will be one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The Government expected to make up to five (5) awards under this single solicitation, and advised potential Offerors that the total combined amount of all the contracts over the potential 5-year term would not exceed $30,000,000.00. Individual Delivery were estimated to range from the simplified acquisition threshold to approximately $2,790,000.00. Individual Delivery Orders would be competed amongst all successful awardees, unless an exception to fair opportunity existed. The applicable NAICS code was 236220, with a small business size standard of $33.5 million. The evaluation criteria consisted of the following: Price; Past Performance; Similar Experience; Technical Plan; and Socio-Economic Status. There was a seed (representative) project contained within the solicitation for which all prospective Offerors were required to submit a proposal. The price submitted for this project was one of the bases for evaluation by the Government of the evaluation factor "price." The Solicitation was conducted under the total small business set-aside procedures of FAR 19.5.</p>
<p><br />On July 8th, 2013, the General Services Administration Region 1 Acquisition Division awarded 5 Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contracts as a result of Solicitation GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0003:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Contract GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0003, with CCB, Inc., of Westbrook, Maine;<br />&bull; Contract GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0012, CTS Inc., of Danvers, Massachusetts;<br />&bull; Contract GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0013, with Cornerstone Construction Services, LLC, of Reading, Massachusetts;<br />&bull; Contract GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0014, with Maron Construction Co, Inc., of Providence, Rhode Island;<br />&bull; Contract GS-01P-13-BZ-D-0015, with Watermark Environmental, Inc., of Lowell, Massachusetts</p>
<p><br />These contracts were awarded for a 1-year base period with four 1-year options. The entire potential term of the contracts was July 9th, 2013 through July 8th 2018 (with a potential extension to January 8th, 2019).</p>
<p><br />Section I.C.1 of the contract(s) state(s): "Maximum Contract Value: The total amount of all Delivery Orders issued under the individual base contracts combined will not exceed $30,000,000.00 over the potential 5-year term of the Contract. As more Orders are issued under one Contract, the value of Orders which can be issued under the remaining Contracts drops by an equal amount. Individual Delivery Orders will range from $100,000.00 to $2,790,000.00. However, in accordance with FAR 52.216-19 ("Order Limitations"), the successful awardees will not be required (but may elect) to honor any Requests for Proposal below or above the stated limits."</p>
<p><br />On April 21, 2017, the General Services Administration Region 1 Acquisition Division raised the Maximum Contract Value (MCV) from $30 million to $40 million, due to an unanticipated level of construction requirements received by the Region.</p>
<p><br />On March 29, 2018, the General Services Administration Region 1 Acquisition Division issued Solicitation Number 47PB0018R0006, which requested proposals for the provision of Construction Services for the General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Region 1. The services required would provide for the award of individual Delivery Orders for the execution of various construction projects for all federally-owned and leased buildings in the Region, encompassing the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  The Solicitation stated that the estimated price range for the total IDIQ requirement, inclusive of all Geographic Zones and contracts (multiple awards) over the base and all option years is greater than $100 million.  The Region expects to make award of the prospective contracts on or about September 28, 2018.</p>
<p><br />On June 7, 2018, the General Services Administration Region 1 Acquisition Division extended the current contract by a period of six (6) months to December 8, 2018, using the Option Provision at FAR 52.217-8 ("Option to Extend Services").</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Findings</span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />Presently, the total value of all Orders against the referenced contracts is approaching the Maximum Contract Value (MCV) of $40 million, and the increase in the MOL is necessary to ensure existing requirements are fulfilled without delay to meet agency needs.  All five Contractors have been performing satisfactorily, and all Options to date have been elected.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Determination</span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />Based on past procurement history, vendor interest, and competition (and other regulatory) requirements, a new contract vehicle would not be able to be executed in time to satisfy the current need for construction services, nor would such services be available on an expedited basis for emergency requirements.</p>
<p><br />However, raising the MCV by $5 million (for a total of $45 million) would allow the Region to receive uninterrupted construction services, preserve competition, and further GSA's socioeconomic goals (since four of the five small business awardees separately represent an additional socioeconomic category: Woman-Owned Business; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; HUBZone; Small Disadvantaged Business concern).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After review of all salient facts related to this issue, it is determined that with regard to this change:</p>
<p><br />1. The increase in MCV does not represent a material difference between the modified contract and the contract as originally awarded;</p>
<p><br />a. Per Section IDIQ I.C.2 ("Minimum Guarantee") contract Awardees are only guaranteed $1,000.00 per individual contract, and all Awardees have exceeded the minimum guarantee. The contract does not contain any limitation on how many Delivery Orders (either consecutively or in total) can be awarded to each Awardee, nor any dollar limits (other than the MCV) on awards to any individual Awardee.</p>
<p><br />b. Additionally, while Section I.C.1 states that Awardees are not required to honor any Requests for Proposal below $150,000 or above $2.79 million, they are permitted to.</p>
<p><br />2. The type of work is not changed. The scope is still for construction services up to a between $150,000.00 and $2,790,000.00, with the Awardees retaining the ability to respond to projects outside this range.</p>
<p><br />3. The performance period is not changed. The total maximum term remains 5 years and 6 months;</p>
<p><br />4. Costs are unaffected. The only costs directly tied to the IDIQ contracts are contract year ceiling rates for General Conditions, Project Management, Superintendence, Overhead, Profit, Bond, and Insurance, none of which would be affected by raising the capacity.</p>
<p><br />5. The original contract did not specifically address changes to the maximum contract value but that figure was a best estimate of usage at the time of award. While the eventual maximum contract value was an educated estimate, the term of the contract (5 years) was definitively known. With the 5-year-term being fixed, it would have been reasonably anticipated that the MCV might have to be adjusted to accommodate the term.</p>
<p><br />6. It is extremely unlikely that the proposed Modification would have changed the original basis of award or impacted the competition for such.</p>
<p><br />a. Since all five Awardees compete for Delivery Orders, a substantial amount of uncertainty in terms of individual capacity is built into the IDIQ Delivery Order competition process. Historically (though this is not a guarantor of future awards or IDIQ conditions or opportunities), an individual Contractor's percentage of the total award share over the life of the contract has varied from 11% - 31% (or approximately $4.2 million - $11.3 million, a difference of $7.1 million). This uncertainty is reflective of the business risk in the construction industry at large.</p>
<p><br />b. Furthermore, the potential for Modifications (which are also reflective of risk in the construction industry at large) based on unforeseen conditions or changed tenant requirements increases the variability of potential awards. Historically (ibid, no guarantor), Modifications to an individual Contractor's percentage of awards over the life of the Contract has varied from 2% - 15% (or approximately $129,000 - $1.2 million, a difference of $0.9 million).</p>
<p><br />c. Therefore, when combining the competition risk and the performance risk, each Awardee faced a potential variation in award share of $8 million. As referenced, the original contract contained no mechanical limits on awards other than the MCV, and the proposed Modification would not add any further restrictions, nor change the mechanism of the MCV.</p>
<p><br />d. Given that $8 million (or 20% of the total awards) separates the most- and least-successful Awardees, a reasonable person would be hard-pressed to argue that an increase to the MCV of this magnitude would have affected their original business decision whether or not to submit a proposal.</p>
<p><br />e. At the time of the Solicitation, potential Offerors had no way of knowing with any certainty who their competition would be (since this business decision would be made prior to award) or how much competition they would face at any given time during the performance of the Contract (since the Contract didn't constrain how much any one Awardee could be awarded in any given contract year or any other contract lifetime cap, other than the MCV).</p>
<p><br />f. The volatility of the construction industry (even with the limited competition of a small pool of awardees) would make a business decision that hinged upon such a granular numerical level simply unreliable in terms of managing risk.</p>
<p><br />g. Accordingly, based on this data, one could reasonably argue that changing the contract ceiling by this magnitude would have no substantial effect upon the extent and nature of the original competition, since the diversity of the potential work requirements, the estimating process, and the impact of competition on the capacity already represents so much risk to an individual Offeror that changing this one variable has very little impact (if any) on the aggregate level of risk, or the potential capacity needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the above findings, it is determined that an increase of $5 million to the maximum contract value from $40 million to $45 million is in the best interest of the Government and does not materially change or alter the terms of the original award.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Los Angeles County, state of California. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:
<p>(a) A Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and<br /><br />(2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:<br /><br />(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar, large scale civil works construction contracts in Los Angeles County, California? If yes, describe how a PLA will achieve economy and efficiency in the procurement, produce labor management stability, and/or ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards? If no, describe why?<br /><br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br /><br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? How?<br /><br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br /><br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br /><br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br /><br />(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District contract?<br />Please limit your responses to no more than three (3) pages in length. Provide your comments via e-mail transmission to wendell l.mendoza@usace.army.mil not later than 20 November 2017.</p>
