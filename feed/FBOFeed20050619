Environmental Research and Range Cleanup - Research and cleanup which are associated with past, current, and future Air Force operations and industrial processes.  Submit research proposals, which are focused upon issues concerning volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as fuels and solvents.  Environmental research should address, but are not limited to, models that describe the behavior and disposition of environmentally hazardous compounds discharged into the atmosphere, the soil, and aquatic areas; and/or studies of the behavior and disposition of contaminants in the environment.  Environmental proposals may also examine the pathways that contaminants follow to a receptor, which may be human, or other animal life, or plant life.  Proposals that address risk assessment issues related to toxicological mechanisms and human health effects are not desired and may not be evaluated.  Environmental and range cleanup proposals should address either:  (1) requirements to remove or destroy contamination from soil, groundwater, and air utilizing biological systems, chemical, or physical treatments for cleanup both in situ and above ground; or, (2) requirements to address environmental compliance issues through modeling, control, and treatment technologies for solid and liquid hazardous wastes.  Control and treatment technologies may include physical, chemical, or biological processes to accomplish destruction, recovery, recycle, reuse, or conversion to non-hazardous materials or other usable products.  Proposal Preparation:  Responses submitted shall include a proposal for technical and cost/price as follows:  (a) The technical proposal must include an outline and full discussion of the nature and scope of the research, the method or technical approach, and the expected results of each proposal.  This proposal should offer scientific advancement in the state of the art.  The technical proposal must identify privately developed items, components, processes or computer software entailed in their proposed approach, if any.  Information must be included on prior work/experience in the indicated field of research and the available facilities.  Management resources shall include resumes of people who will be participating in the proposed design effort, and identify the principal investigator.  (b) The cost/price proposal requires submission of cost or pricing data IAW FAR 15.403-5 with a supporting detailed cost schedule and shall contain a per person/hour breakdown per task.  FAR 15.403-5 may be located at  http//www.arnet.gov.far/loadmain.html.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will compete for contract award based upon their potential value to the government in fulfilling the requirements set forth above.  That value will be determined using a complex combination of criteria including the technical promise (originality, feasibility, desirability, etc.), affordability (of development, considering technical alternatives and funding available, and of implementation if otherwise successful), and the government's confidence in the effective pursuit of the effort considering the scope of the effort, the offeror's understanding of it, the competence and availability of experienced engineering, scientific, managerial, or other technical personnel, offeror's overall corporate experience (including past performance), and the availability of, or ability to obtain, necessary facilities to perform this effort.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, a part thereof or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Technical consideration will be given greater weight than cost in the selection decision.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in source selection.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Deliverable Items:  (a) Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), DI-MISC-81183A, (b) Contractor?s Progress Status and Management Report, DI-MGMT-80227, (c) Still Photographic Records, DI-MISC-81206, (d) Presentation Material, DI-ADMN-81373, (e) Scientific and Technical Reports, DI-MISC-80711 (Draft and reproducible final, AFRL/MLQ format).

<DESC>SA1301-05-RQ-0047 (AMENDMENT 0001) Disaster Recovery Services for OCS - Department of Commerce - The purpose of this announcement is to amend the foregoing combined solicitation SA1301-05-RQ-0047 which was posted on May 27, 2005. This amendment is issued to provide an extended response date as well as post various questions, answers and clarifications to the original announcement.  

RESPONSE DATE:  The response date for this procurement has been extended from June 20, 2005 to July 05, 2005.  All offers must be received by 2:00 PM EST on July 5th, 2005.  Offers shall be forwarded to Joan Hanicak at the address provided in the original announcement.  Electronic responses are preferred and should be forward to Joan Hanicak at jhanicak@doc.gov and must also be received by the same date and time specified above.     

The following questions, answers and clarifications are provided:    

1. Is only 1 IBM mainframe required?  The RFQ states that it should be compatible with the Z890 and the 9672. 

Only one mainframe is required. The offeror shall provide IBM's VM (Virtual Machine) software to enable OCS to run multiple guest hosts on this machine. Offeror must provide licensing and support for the IBM VM software. 

2. Is the IBM mainframe running in 64 bit mode? 

OCS current configuration is running in 31 bit mode. 

3. Is EMC storage required or can other storage brands be used? 
  
EMC is required. 

4.  Please clarify the requirement for when the hardware configuration shall be made available to OCS at the backup site. Paragraph C.3.1 indicates within 8 hours and paragraph C.3.5 indicates within 12 hours.

If it is possible, we prefer the hardware configuration at the backup site be made available to us within 8 hours of notification of a disaster and 12 hours would be the maximum acceptable length of time that we can wait for access to the hardware configuration at the backup site. If both are possible, propose both time periods with the cost associated for each selection.  

5.  Does this requirement include Disaster Recovery Plans?  

No.  This requirement does not include the development or enhancement of Disaster Recovery Plans.  DOC already has Business Continuity Plans as well as a Disaster Recovery Plans and has not included either in this requirement.       

6.  With regard to an e-mail received from an offeror who stated that they would monitor DOCs network

The requirement for monitoring has not been included in this procurement, is considered beyond the scope of this requirement and would not be allowed.  This requirement is for a hot backup site to provide DOC with an infrastructure as well as the support services necessary to enable OCS staff to restore our systems should our site become unavailable.  DOCs hardware and telecommunications requirements are stated in the original announcement. Upon declaration of a disaster DOC, Office of Computer Services (OCS) staff will travel to the hot backup site and commence restoration of our network and systems.  

7.  What is the Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?  RTA is the measure of time from the time DOC declares a disaster even until DOC requires their IT operations have been restored and is back in service.

From the time the necessary hardware configuration at the backup site is made available, DOC staff members are required to restore the operations in varying timeframes depending on DOC customer requirements.  The maximum recovery time allowable is 24 hours from the time OCS gains access to the necessary hardware configuration at the backup site until everything is available to our customers.   

8.  What is the Recovery Point Objective (RTO)?  TRO is the measure of the amount of data DOC is willing to risk losing in a disaster  for example, daily backups taken offsite imply a willingness to lose up to one days worth of data.

In the event of a declared disaster, DOC staff must rely on backup media taken offsite daily to perform recovery procedures. This backup media could be up to 24 hours old at the time of the disaster and could result in some loss of data for our customers. The optional requirement stated in C.4 of the original announcement, Real Time Options would provide for off site real time mirroring of our data which would potentially eliminate the loss of customer data.

All other terms and conditions of the original announcement posted on May 27th, 2005 remains unchanged and applicable to this combined solicitation announcement. Because of the urgency of this procurement, no other extensions are anticipated.  DOC will attempt to answer any further questions but it is requested that any remaining questions must be received by June 24th to allow for processing and posting. Please direct comments or questions by e-mail to Joan Hanicak at jhanicak@doc.gov.
