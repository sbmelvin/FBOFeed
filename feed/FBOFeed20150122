However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firms(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice (synopsis) is for chemical water treatment for 3 Water Tube Boilers and 4 Ceramic Cooling Towers at VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALB). The Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, supervision, chemicals and equipment necessary. Water treatment is necessary for the boilers and cooling towers located at VALB. The water supply that comes from the city contains hardness, turbidity and high conductivity. If the water that feeds the boilers and cooling towers is not treated, it can easily build up scales and reduce heat transfer. Water that is not properly treated can harm the metals with rust and corrosion and damage the internal metal of the vessels. Chemical treatment helps to dissolve and reduce mineral deposits (like calcium build-up), prevent rust and corrosion and help prevent the growth of bacterial pathogens like legionella. In addition, chemical treatments can reduce the cost of producing steam and chilled water. Water treatment will reduce operating costs and avoid costly repairs for VALB.
The Solicitation number will be VA262-15-Q-0348. The intended contract period will be for one year beginning on the date of contract award. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 221310, size standard of $27.5M. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and complete their Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA). The website is www.sam.gov. 
Potential qualified small business sources are being sought for this procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL), Water Supply and Water Resource Division (WSWRD) has a requirement to purchase Time Domain Reflectometers, Vened Pressure Transducer and supplies.
This procurement is for 28 each Time Domain Reflectometers, 1 each Vened Pressure Transducer, 2 each Dataloggers, mounting and support supplies for Campbell Scientific instruments to support the EPA embedding of sensors to track the movement of runoff through stormwater control measures for a second research location.  The equipment will be used to track the surface clogging and changes in exfiltration rates.  The monitoring will also track the exfiltration pathways in the saturated and unsaturated subsurface.  Autonomous monitoring is expected to be ongoing for several years.  The second location is in Louisville, KY.  At sites in Louisville, EPA will monitor similar exfiltration pathways and also use high density sensors to monitor the infiltration areas and changes in the infiltration areas with stormwater control measure age. Campbell Scientific products have been in use since the beginning of the project. Using Campbell Scientific products assures that existing programs,  protocols and procedures can be applied at the sites and the information collected is directly comparable; and that existing EPA-owned equipment can be used with the newly purchased equipment.  The EPA is seeking quotes from vendors who can supply all of the instruments and support supplies.
The procurement is for Brand Named off the shelf commercial items.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516.  The size standard for this code is 500 employees. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  Solicitation number SOL-CI-15-00012 will be posted via fedconnect on or about February 9, 2015 at www.fedconnect.net.  Anticipated award date will be in March 1, 2015. Questions must be submitted in writing to Mr. Garry A. Plear via e-mail at plear.garry@epa.gov. Telephone queries will not be honored.

<DESC>There is a need to replace an obsolete hydrant fuel system built in 1959 that violates criteria for airfield clearance safety. A modern pressurized hydrant fuel system will be constructed using an existing operating storage tanks and pumphouse to support six new hydrant outlets. A new fuel transfer pipeline from the fuel storage area will replace the existing corroded pipeline. This base supports the 4th Fighter Wing and a reserve air refueling wing (KC-135) as well as numerous transient wide-bodied aircraft needing to be refueled. The hydrant refueling system must be capable of supporting hot pit refueling and transient aircraft refueling.  <br> The project will consist of roughly 3,000 ln meters of 12 quote mark hydrant loop piping, 6 hydrant pits, high point vent assembly, low point drain pit assembly, leak detection system, miscellaneous piping, testing, utilities, site improvements, airfield paving, controls, purge and abandon existing fuel lines, demolition- pump house, building 6 ea- underground storage tanks, piping, and fill stand

Those firms required to submit subcontracting plans are expected to conduct market research to determine appropriate subcontracting goals.  A subcontracting plan is separate from the Small Business Participation plan and must meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 (or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the offeror has a comprehensive subcontracting plan).    SUBCONTRACTING PLANS SHALL REFLECT AND BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TOTAL CONTRACT DOLLAR COMMITMENTS OFFERED IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN    <br>  <br> Ample opportunity will exist for subcontracting with all types of small businesses including SDB, WOSB, HZ, and SDVOSB firms.  By providing subcontracting opportunities to small business, the large businesses both formally and informally mentor these businesses by helping them gain experience and increase their ability to perform at a higher level.  This in turn helps the small business grow as a company and independently compete for larger projects as prime contractors or upper tier subcontractors.   <br>  <br>  <br> 4.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the Human Systems Integration and Sciences Division (RDNS-WSH) located at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting concept papers from industry and academia to develop an in-depth research strategy to determine the effects of weight and area of coverage (encapsulation) of head borne systems on aural-visual task performance. Initially, a white paper proposal will be submitted and reviewed and those that are selected will be invited to NSRDEC for a full briefing and presentation of proposals.  The desired final outcome would be the selection of a finalized research proposal for contract initiation and execution.   <br>  <br> Current research efforts within the Army are directed towards optimizing soldiers' levels of ballistic protection to allow for improved action-perception and situational awareness capabilities. Head-borne loads, including helmets, are a specific area of concern.  A soldier's ability to maintain situational awareness and effectively identify enemy targets and other threats while wearing head-borne systems translates directly to increased survivability and unit effectiveness. The purpose of this effort is to develop and execute a research strategy to determine the effects of weight and area of coverage (encapsulation) of head borne systems on threat identification using Ecological Task analysis and approaches from Dynamic Systems Theory. <br>  <br> Specifically, this effort will develop research plans to determine the following: <br> 1.	Effects of Encapsulation on Aural-Visual Task Performance <br> 2.	Effects of Moment Load and Distribution on Aural-Visual Task Performance <br> 3.	Combined Effects of Load and Encapsulation on Aural-Visual Task Performance <br>  <br> These research strategies must provide the following data: <br> 1.	Operational Task Performance - These task level metrics should be characterized in terms of the spatial-temporal changes in task performance (e.g. Time to Identify Target, % Correct Identifications, etc) under the variety of load and encapsulation parameters. These metrics provide information specific to the functional capabilities of the soldier.  <br> 2.	Coordinative Dynamics Metrics - Metrics in the coordinative dynamics are those that directly underlie performance at the task level and are helpful for understanding the changes in coordinative dynamics while wearing protective helmets. Examples include: Eye-Head-Trunk coordination and variability, Head-Helmet Relative Motion, Head -Trunk Coordination, Head/Gaze Angle - Target Coupling, Variability Analysis/Motor Abundance.  <br> 3.	Underlying Dynamics - Metrics of underlying dynamics are those more abstract analysis of the ongoing dynamics within the Organism-Environment system capable of capturing the complexity of the dynamics, stability-variability relations, specific coupling relations, or other measures deemed relevant to task performance. This analysis could include time-series analysis, fractal analysis, power law relations, and other tools within Dynamic Systems Theory capable of using variables that capture organism-environmental relations (e.g. Center of Pressure (CoP), Eye-Movement time series, etc).   <br> 4.	Aural-Visual Task Perception supporting Task performance - Helmet area of coverage impairs both aural and visual localization of potential environmental threats (information specification of the threat). When having to orient towards these threats in dynamic environments, this suggests that a greater degree of visual search may be required as aural uncertainty increases and vice-versa. A multi-modal approach is desired that captures the trade-offs and contributions of these perceptual modes (aural-visual) in target identification tasks in dynamic environments under a variety of load and area of coverage parameters.  <br>  <br> The proposed research approach must clearly identify how and why the effort will be successful including the proposed personnel, materials, and equipment required to execute the research protocols.  Approximate cost and schedule should also be provided in the concept paper. Concept development strategies without such supporting information will be weighed negatively.  Interested parties will submit a white paper proposal for evaluation.  NSRDEC will invite authors of selected white papers to an onsite briefing in May 2013 by NSRDEC. During the initial meeting, NSRDEC will present the  quote mark problem space, quote mark  including the current challenges, the problem constraints, what NSRDEC's expectations are for research undertaken to resolve the problem space, and discussion of the potential means by which the above goals may be achieved. Those parties invited to NSRDEC will then be given time to prepare a presentation on possible research strategies and capabilities to be presented to NSRDEC on an individual basis on the following day. Successful presentations to NSRDEC will result in the invitation to begin the Proposal process, which includes the ability to collaborate and discuss specific approaches with the Technical Point of Contact (POC) to optimize successful submission. Following proposal submission, no contact with the technical POC may occur as the official selection process for contract award will begin.   <br>  <br> Technical reporting shall be conducted at a minimum, on a quarterly basis and/or associated with significant technical milestones outlined in the concepts programmatic approach.  Technical reporting will require complete documentation of the research and development efforts including cost, schedule and performance updates.   <br>  <br> All efforts are subject to availability of funds. <br>  <br> All interested firms are encouraged to submit a concept paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation W911QY-13-R-0032, which can be found at http://www3.natick.army.mil. The BAA contains instructions for submission of Concept Papers against Topic #19 Ecological Approach to Warfighter Survivability; Perception-Action-Cognition, subtopics 2 and 4.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the synopsis process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this synopsis. Firms responding to this synopsis shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government, and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are invited to submit a concept paper under the topic referenced above and shall submit via email to Gail Bernheart (gail.d.bernheart.civ@mail.mil) by 22 April 2013.  The Government shall evaluate all concept papers and provide a written response/on-site invitation to the authors on or about 03 May, 2013.  Technical questions concerning this acquisition should be addressed to Dr. Christopher Palmer, via e-mail Christopher.j.palmer18.civ@mail.mil or 508-233-5196.  Authors are highly encouraged to speak with the above POC prior to white paper submission. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.   The Natick BAA is effective from April 1, 2013 through March 30, 2015. This synopsis expires in 30 days. <br>

<p>DTRA's Research and Development (RD) Nuclear Technologies Nuclear Threats (NTDN) branch seeks technologies to detect, assess, monitor and assist in the mitigation of nuclear threats via non-radiological means. The main focus of the branch is the ability to localize search and mitigation efforts from large, wide areas such as a country or region, to an area where radiation detection or direct action can be successfully applied. Another focus is to provide capability to determine if a non-US nuclear weapon or nuclear materials have been compromised; if they have gone from an accountable to unaccountable status, have been stolen, etc.</p>
<p>DTRA seeks a performer with the capabilities to provide information that will enable DTRA NTDN to determine the best investment strategy and areas of research. This effort combines and integrates research, subject matter expertise, literature research, and scenario analysis to provide insights into detecting radiological and nuclear threats via non-radiological means.</p>
<p>Specific requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to perform classified work at the Top Secret level to research and assess data and technical insights on foreign nuclear weapons handling and security procedures. The ability to take said information and determine what signatures or indicators can be used to determine if there is an event of NTDN's concern, or use these signatures and indicators to localize search efforts.<br />&bull; Ability to bring subject matter experts into the effort for insight and to predict realistic scenarios.<br />&bull; Ability to facilitate and conduct scenario walk-throughs of potential "loose nuke" scenarios to determine signatures and indicators of concern and learn where NTDN could effectively apply their time and funding.<br />&bull; Ability to facilitate and conduct peer-review of material.<br />&bull; Ability to draft and execute an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Avoidance and Mitigation Plan.</p>
<p>Sources having the capability to meet these requirements are invited to respond to this notice.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for a System that is specially designed for dose-controlled and spatially uniform deposition of liquid aerosols on cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI Cultures) in 12-well culture sized inserts.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) anticipate requirements for multiple exposure modules or systems that are specially designed for dose-controlled and spatially uniform deposition of liquid aerosol nanoparticles on cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI Cultures) in 12-well culture sized inserts. The Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology (DGMT) has several collaborative on-going research projects involving nanoparticles. The exposure modules will be used for exposing the 3D tissue culture cell models (ALI cultures) to nanoparticle aerosols that are nebulized. The research aim is to develop 3D tissue culture models to mimic human like exposures to nanoparticles. The exposures of the 3D tissue cultures to nebulized aerosol nanoparticles require the use of a highly specialized exposure module.</p>
<p>The ALI culture models will be cultured in 12-well inserts and then get consistent exposure using the exposure modules specified herein.</p>
<p>The project involves exposing human cell ALI cultures used in the cytotoxicity assay to nebulized aerosol nanoparticles. This equipment will be used to conduct the studies outlined above to provide needed data to determine the risks associated with exposure to specific levels of nanoparticles, thus filling in data-gaps that exist in risk assessment models. In addition, the equipment will allow the FDA to be able to quantify the toxicity of nanoparticles, and will provide the FDA with data regarding the relative toxic and biomarkers of harm for FDA regulated nanoparticles.</p>

<p><br />SEE ATTACHMENT A: IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND ATTACHMENT B: 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE STILL IN ACCORDANCE AND VALID SINCE EXISTING BASE CONTRACT.(Per the Information Systems Security Officer and Section 508 Coordinator)</p>
<p><br />A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative organized by the NHGRI, the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical center that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center with a mission that has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and diseases.</p>
<p>The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. The unique tools and computing infrastructure is needed to improve, optimize and refine the UDP PhenoTips server that is currently deployed in the NIH UDP laboratory. These support the research needs of the UDP by providing a robust platform on which to perform the necessary phenotype analysis and record them into the PhenoTips server to be viewed by laboratory personnel and collaborators.</p>
<p>B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>The base infrastructure was developed by the University of Toronto and Gene42, Inc. on behalf of the National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to provide and develop software that contains the ability to perform Glycomics measurements in the LIMS PhenoTips server that is already deployed in the UDP Program at the NIH. Additionally, the base contract provided synchronization services between the internal and external PhenoTips instances. These features allow for further required functionality in the PhenoTips server</p>
<p>The Phase 2 and procurement of the continued Contract will provide and further develop the neuroradiology interface within the LIMS PhenoTips server that is already deployed in the UDP Program at the NIH. Additionally, the Contractor will provide synchronization services between the internal and external PhenoTips instances as well as one year of gold support. These features will allow for further required functionality in the PhenoTips server.</p>
<p>C. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work:</span></p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to further develop software to input neuroradiology image and data on PhenoTips server that is currently integrated into the LIMS system designed to manage UDP patient samples and data throughout the UDP program including clinical and laboratory personnel as well as collaborator data. The PhenoTips server is used by the clinical staff to input patient phenotype data into the LIMS system using standardized HPO terms. The further development will include a more effective interface that includes structured anatomical organs that can be mapped to appropriate HPO terms. Also integral to this process is to update the PhenoTips instances on the collaborator and internal sites on a regular basis to incorporate the necessary changes to the system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTRACTOR</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Shall develop improvements to the Neuroradiology User Interface:<br />o Shall contain the ability to enter Neuroradiology data structured by anatomical organs<br />o Shall contain the ability to rapidly select organ structure that has been mapped to HPO terms<br />o Shall add novel relevant HPO terms at the discretion of the HPO development team.</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PhenoTips Gold Support, 1 year</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Level 1: System unavailable for use or significant functionality failure affecting all users. Endeavour to fix within 24 hours;<br />&bull; Level 2: System unavailable for use by some users or some significant functionality failure affecting some or most users. Endeavour to fix within 48 hours;<br />&bull; Level 3: Other faults: Endeavour to fix within two weeks, or longer if agreed with the Customer; and<br />&bull; provide and install new versions during the year.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synchronization with UDN PhenoTips instance: (100 hours development time):<br /></span>&bull; Develop functionality to synchronize the UDP PhenoTips data with other external PhenoTips instances, including the expected Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) PhenoTips instance. This synchronization will enable for the transfer of relevant patient data (appropriately de-&shy;&#8208;identified) to the external servers automatically upon final signoff by the UDP clinician.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neuroradiology User Interface Improvements (100 hours development time</span>):<br />&bull; Develop a more effective user interface for input of Neuroradiology data, structured by anatomical organs with rapid ability to select relevant organ<br />structure, and mapped to appropriate HPO terms, where available. We will also request for the addition of novel relevant terms into the HPO, however their inclusion will be at the discretion of the HPO development team.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 5.65pt 0in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN">The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 "core conditions" and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 5.65pt 0in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN">Sec. 116 of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 encourages the NIH to "continue carrying out, coordinating, and expanding research in newborn screening -- - including identifying, developing, and testing the most promising new screening technologies, in order to improve already existing screening tests, increasing the specificity of newborn screening, and expanding the number of conditions for which screening tests are available." </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 5.65pt 0in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN">It has become evident that a major impediment to adding new conditions to the RUSP (recommended uniform screening panel) are the challenges related to implementing new technologies in high throughput newborn screening laboratories. The ability to provide evidence of the feasibility of the assay, both scientifically and logistically, in a timely manner is difficult. This is especially apparent when screening for rare diseases where the likelihood of detecting a single case during standard newborn screening in a single laboratory can take years. Collaborative efforts, implemented across multiple states or newborn screening laboratories, are necessary for the successful development and implementation of new assays. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 5.65pt 0in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN">The purpose of this requirement is to support the development of novel technologies in newborn screening. This will be accomplished by conducting pilot studies of screening tools for new and promising conditions in a high throughput newborn screening environment. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 5.65pt 0in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN">It is the intent of this initiative to encourage collaboration with other Federal agencies with each agency focusing on their areas of expertise in the field. The project will also leverage resources that are part of NICHD's Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) including access to the Laboratory Performance Program developed to collect, aggregate and analyze de-identified screening data. </span></p>

<DESC>Statement of Need
Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) Probe Disinfector Unit

Statement of Need:  
The Lebanon VA Medical Center Sterile Processing Service (SPS) has a need for a TEE Probe Disinfector Unit.  The newly opened Surgical Center at the Lebanon VAMC will allow more procedures to be done in our facility; this will include an increased use of transesophageal echocardiography.  Therefore, there is a need for a disinfecting unit that will perform high-level disinfection of these probes in an efficient and safe manner for the department and medical personnel performing the HLD task.  An automated, enclosed unit for this disinfection will reduce the amount of stress and the potential for damage to the TEE probes as compared to those when performing manual reprocessing.  Automated enclosed unit for HLD will also eliminate exposure to harmful fumes and vapors associated manual reprocessing.

Principle of Operation:
The unit would disinfect each TEE probe with a disinfectant and provide printed verification upon completion of successful disinfection cycle.  The unit needs to be simple to use for any healthcare professional reprocessing a used TEE ultrasound probe. 

Intended Use:
The intended use of the unit will be for high-level disinfection of TEE ultrasound probes of which will be performed in the Endoscopy Reprocessing Area of the new Lebanon VAMC Surgery Center by SPS Staff personnel.

The Unit Purchased Shall Include:
Item	Description	QTY
001	TD-100 COMPLETE WITH PRE-INSTALLATION KIT, STARTER KIT AND VAPOR MANAGEMENT FILTER PN: CS-TD100S MFR: CS Medical Brand Name or Equal 	1
002	NEUTRALIZATION STATION PN: AC-DS-03 MFR: CS Medical Brand Name or Equal	1
		

The Unit Purchased shall have the following features:
"	High-level disinfection cycle that would be complete in approximately 5 minutes
"	Individual rinse cycles after disinfection cycle is complete
"	Built-in vapor management system to capture and neutralize disinfectant fumes for safety
"	Microprocessor-controlled for ease of use by medical personnel
"	Repeatable, verified disinfection cycle
"	Printed record of successful disinfection cycle
"	Single-use high-level disinfectant to be used
"	Full diagnostic check of each disinfection cycle
"	No minimum effective concentration (MEC) testing necessary
"	120V Ac - UL Certified

Dimensions, size, and capacity:
"	A compact unit is desired as space is limited in reprocessing room
"	Approximate size that would work in the space provided:  24" W x 8" D x 44" H

Utility Specifications/Requirement:  Depending on the item purchased, there will likely be water supply requirements (delivery pressure, flow rate, temperature of water supply) and will likely also have drain requirements (drain pipe and trap).

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought: Succeeding Lease - Watertown, NY

The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Watertown, NY that will be expiring. 

The Government is seeking to lease a minimum of 8667 Net Usable Square Feet (NUSF) and a maximum of 8700 NUSF of office and related space in Watertown, NY. 

The lease term requirement is for term of up to ten (10) years: three (3) years firm with seven (7), one (1) year option periods. The VA seeks a full-service lease (all utility, services, janitorial, snow removal and maintenance costs included in rent).The space must be available for occupancy by 1 July 2015.  

The delineated area:

Contractor facility must be physically located in Jefferson County within a 15 mile radius of Watertown in the state of New York AND within the corridor of the current public transportation services that currently run within the city.
 
Other applicable requirements include:

"	On-site parking is required for at least 60 parking spaces, 5 of these will be disabled spaces and 18 will be designated for Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs).   All 18 spaces shall be marked "Reserved" for the exclusive use of the VA.   Additional 30 spaces for parking for the balance of employees would have to be no farther than 2 blocks from the site, with preference for all parking to be on-site. The site will need to be entirely handicapped accessible and within 1 block of public transportation.
"	Compliant with American with Disabilities Act 
"	Contiguous space on one floor or at a minimum in the amounts of four locations that must equal approx.  sq footage of 3975, 2042, 1530 and 1120 and have access to an elevator. 
"	Proximity to public transportation
"	Proximity to eateries, banks and other commercial stores
"	Building cannot be within a 100 year flood plain
"	Specific Information Technology & Security requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.

Please send expressions of interest to: 

Sandra L Fisher, Contracting Officer
Syracuse VA Medical Center
Network Contracting Office 2 
800 Irving Ave
Syracuse, NY 13210
E-mail: sandra.fisher3@va.gov

"	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking 
"	Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building

<DESC>Dear Vendor,

On December 19, 2014, VA issued Request for Information (RFI) # VA119A-15-N-0055.  Several responses were received by the due date of January 5, 2015.  

VA is issuing a follow-up RFI # VA119A-15-N-0078 that includes questions that were not included as part of the original RFI that was issued on December 19, 2014.  To support VA in its market research, VA requests vendor responses to the following:

1)	Provide an estimate of the number of days your company can complete an exam - from the initial exam request, scheduling, exam completion, and return of exam results to VA - keeping in mind the high volume of exams across your network of exam providers.

2)	Provide an estimate of the ramp-up period (i.e. total number of days) necessary to bring performance to full capacity.  This includes establishing all IT interfaces with VA systems necessary to transmit exam data between vendor and VA.

3)	Provide the number of physicians available under your existing network of exam providers.  Please include the number and types of any specialists.

4)	Confirm whether your company intends to compete for this requirement under a teaming agreement or mentor/protg arrangement with a larger business.

5)	Confirm whether your company currently has the capability to satisfy the Federal Acquisition Regulation's (FAR) Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR clause 52.219-14).  Specifically, confirm whether your company has the capacity to successfully perform at least 50% of the contract requirements with its own employees (excluding exams handled by subcontracted exam providers).  For example, your company must perform at least 50% of the work necessary to support administrative, management, and IT requirements under the contract.

Please note that failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude any vendor from submitting an offer to any subsequent solicitation, should VA choose to issue a solicitation.  If your company did not respond to the RFI that was issued on December 19, 2014, you may provide your response at this time.

Other than a due date of February 5, 2015 for responses to this RFI and the questions listed above, the remainder of this document is identical to RFI # VA119A-15-N-0055 that was previously issued on December 19, 2014.

VA reserves the right to add additional military bases to the BDD or IDES programs as necessary. Additionally, VA reserves the right to substitute the above regional offices with different regional offices within that region. These locations (both Regional Offices or IDES/BDD sites) are subject to change as required by the VA in which 60-90 days ramp-up will be provided to the contractor to hire and train additional personnel. If a Regional Office is substituted, it will be in accordance with the region of the replaced Regional Office (ex. An Eastern Region Regional Office will only be switched with an Eastern Region Regional Office). Any Regional Office may be substituted into the National Region.
Note: Pricing is firm-fixed price per region and will not be re-negotiated if a VARO listed in the table at paragraph A.2 within the same region is substituted for a current VARO. For example, if Togus, ME is substituted for Atlanta, GA in the Eastern region, the Eastern region pricing will not be renegotiated or modified.






























3.  Background:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) administers the Compensation & Pension (C&P) Program for benefits to Veterans, their dependents, and their survivors. Entitlement determinations for disability compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs) and Decision Review Officers (DROs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the country.  VA Central Office (VACO) assists the VAROs.  A medical disability examination is a critical piece of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment, and thus the percent of disability that defines the dollar benefit a Veteran is awarded. Because it is so critical, the examination report must be of high quality, providing essential information to support each disability diagnosed. It is not enough to simply state a diagnosis. The examination report must provide detailed findings sufficient for RVSRs and DROs to arrive at a determination that is able to withstand the scrutiny of appellate review. If a Veteran disagrees with a disability rating or findings, he/she can appeal such, and that is why examinations must be clear and strong enough to be upheld on appellate review.  The Contractor therefore shall follow the requirements of the worksheets to ensure that sufficient criteria are met.

On October 9, 1996, Congress enacted Public Law 104-275, which authorized VA to conduct a limited pilot program to contract for medical examinations from non-VA medical sources.  The report went on to state a desire to see the contract medical examination authority expanded and made permanent. The pilot program was successful, and a subsequent contract was awarded under the same public law authority. In fiscal year 2009, 136,483 exams were requested and 130,263 examinations were conducted from the VAROs and Benefits at Discharge Delivery sites under the current contract. The current contract expires December 30, 2015.
	
4.  Performance Period:  The period of performance will be five (5) years from date of award (i.e. 1 base year plus 4 option years). Exercise of options will be made at the sole discretion of the Government. If the VA chooses not to exercise an option, that shall not be deemed a termination of the contract. 
  
5.  Type of Contract:  Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).

6.  Place of Performance: Contractor's Office and Subcontractor's Examination Offices

7.  Ordering: Task orders will be issued annually on a "lot" basis and funding will be provided in a lump sum amount for the total order. Individual Examination requests will be sent to contractors electronically through the Centralized Administration Accounting System (CAATS) a VA Information System. The contractor will receive an encrypted text file (Individual Examination request). Contractors will invoice monthly based on the actual examinations completed. The COR will verify invoices to ensure services were completed and billed in accordance with the contract and task order. The COR will also monitor the task order funding and request an order modification if additional funding will be required. 

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1.  The Contractor shall provide Contract Medical Disability Examinations (MDE) for the VBA. The Contractor shall be required to provide these services within the jurisdiction of the listed VAROs as well as within the vicinity of military bases across the country participating in the BDD and IDES programs under the National Region. Whether the Contractor wishes to coordinate with the military bases to schedule examinations on the physical military bases is at the discretion and responsibility of the Contractor.  

Additional BDD and IDES sites may require service by the Contractor during the course of the contract. In instances where support in new or different sites is required, the Contractor will be provided 60-90 days ramp-up time, unless negotiated, to hire and train additional personnel.  Ramp up performance consists of all the preparation activities, including but not limited to the following: making capital expenditures, ensuring a qualified workforce is in place, conducting background investigations and establishing security clearances where applicable, providing appropriate training, and implementing the information technology support necessary to fully perform the requirements contained in the PWS.  

2.  The Contractor shall furnish all required services, facilities, and equipment required to perform the contract in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications contained herein and at the established firm fixed price rates.  

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

1.  Contractor shall use the Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQs) provided by VA as the standard for all evaluations.  Contractor shall complete Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) only with accompanying appropriate C&P worksheet completion.  Contractor shall provide, based on specific VA request, the full range of medical disability examinations for the following areas:  Musculoskeletal; organs of sense; infectious, immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; neurologic; mental disorders; dental and oral examinations.  Based on specific VA request, special purpose examinations shall be provided including:  cold injury protocol, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and aid and attendance or housebound status examinations.  Audiology, dental, eye, and mental examinations must be conducted by specialists in those fields.  Specialists able to perform initial TBI examinations (TBI examinations where a previous diagnoses of Traumatic Brain Injury does not exist) are Psychiatry, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Physiatry and who have training and experience with Traumatic Brain Injury (additionally, specialists in audiology are needed to evaluate any issue related to tinnitus due or hearing loss that may be a residual of a TBI, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist would be required to evaluate residuals of a TBI that effected the eyes).   Examinations for the residual effects of TBI, where a traumatic brain injury has been diagnosed by a Neurologist, Neurosurgeon, Physiatrist or Psychiatrist may be conducted by non-specialist, C&P providers if TBI DMA certified. All other body systems claimed conditions examinations do not need to be conducted by specialists unless specifically requested on an individual case basis by VA. Scheduling at a central or subcontractor's facilities is at the Contractor's discretion.

The Traumatic Brain Injury C&P exam worksheet allows for evaluation of any and all potential residuals of traumatic brain injury. The actual event, traumatic brain injury, is conceded by VA prior to scheduling of an evaluation.   The evaluation includes a comprehensive examination to document all physical or mental effects. Specialist examinations may be needed as indicated for evaluation of residuals involving the eye, audiology and mental/cognitive and/or psychological issues.   TBI Cognitive and /or any neuropsychologic assessment must be performed by a psychologist and/or psychiatrist.   Subsequent specific neuropsychologic testing generated from the initial cognitive/neuropsychologic assessment will be performed by a psychiatrist and/or/psychologist.  

Non-specialty examinations will be grouped into the following categories: 

A.	Comprehensive General Medical Examinations (CLIN 0001) represent complete base-line examinations covering all parts of the body.  Cold injury protocol examinations and aid and attendance or household status examinations when requested are also included in the Comprehensive General Medical Examination category.  Shared Examinations (BDD/DES/JE) are General Medical Examinations that are conducted in conjunction with Department of Defense. The Separation Health Assessment work sheet should be used instead of General Medical Examination Compensation and Pension (C&P) Worksheet. The Department of Defense may require additional laboratory, tests, and procedures to be performed than would normally be associated with a CLIN 0001 General Medical Examination. All costs are for Shared Examinations (exam, tests, procedures, labs, x-rays, photographs) are to be invoiced under CLIN 0004.

Joint Examinations (JE) are exam settings resulting from collaborative efforts of VA and DoD.  Disability Examinations conducted under this "Exam Setting" act as both the service member's separation physical for DoD purposes as well as the VA medical disability examination used for rating purposes.  To fulfill its function as the DoD separation physical, certain pre-requisite diagnostic tests known as the Part 1 examination, are performed based on DoD instruction.  This diagnostic testing will vary depending on the individual being examined, the branch of military and the military facility from which the service member is discharging and may not correspond to any claimed or referred conditions. Included in the approved diagnostic testing is:

i.     Audio Screening;
ii.    Snellen's Visual Acuity Screening;
iii.   Hem Occult;
iv.   PSA;
v.    EKG;
vi.   Chest X-Ray;
vii.  Lipid panel: CBC;
viii. Lipid panel: CMP;
ix.   Hepatitis C Screening;
x.    Urinalysis;
xi.   PAP Smear;
xii.  HIV Screening;
xiii. Fasting Glucose; and
xiv. Rapid Plasma Regain (RPR).

a.	Detailed Examinations - Level I includes examinations limited to specific conditions without review of other systems, but requiring examination based on three or more examination worksheets.

b.	Detailed Examinations - Level II include examinations limited to specific conditions without review of other systems, but requiring examination based on fewer than three examination worksheets.

B. Quick Start Examinations (CLIN 0032) Quick Start is one of the Pre-Discharge programs, as evidenced on the VA Pre-Discharge website (http://www.vba.va.gov/predischarge/ ).  

Quick Start claims are received by VA within 59 days and 1 day prior to the discharge of the claimant from military service.  Examinations for Quick Start claims are not shared with DOD.  The examination will be handled as if the claim was received after the service member's military discharge date.  Please use CLIN 0032 and respective sub CLINs when invoicing for this type of exam.

2.  Examinations for the following categories will NOT be required by the Contractor except for special cases that will be agreed upon in advance by VA and the Contractor: pregnant service members or Veterans; protocol examinations for Original Gulf War Environmental Claims for undiagnosed illnesses; U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims cases; examinations requiring hospitalization or surgical evaluation, such as sleep apnea or endometriosis needing laparoscopy; protocol examinations for former Prisoners of War; 38 USC 1151 initial determinations; Veterans residing in VA domiciles/nursing homes; and incarcerated Veterans. In addition, no request for review of records in the determination of Death Indemnity Compensation (DIC) or examinations for Veterans' or service members' spouses or dependents will be sent to the Contractor.

3.  Contractor shall schedule examinations as close to the Veteran's home of record as feasible but generally no further than fifty (50) miles for non-specialist examination and one hundred (100) miles for specialist examinations. The VA may allow for greater distances where service in remote geographical areas is required, with remote geographical areas being those that are sparsely populated and have limited numbers of potential examiners.  The Contractor shall reimburse the Veteran for mileage traveled in accordance with paragraph E.2 above. Proximity and travel time requirements are of higher priority than reimbursement costs.

4.  Contractor shall schedule all examinations. The volume of requests per month may vary. At a minimum service level, the Contractor shall notify the Veteran telephonically, via electronically secure method, or via a mailed postage-prepaid letter, so that the Veteran will receive notification of the scheduled appointment at least five calendar days prior to the scheduled appointment. In lieu of the five calendar days, verbal confirmation of attendance to the appointment is acceptable. The Contractor must also provide the Veteran with a follow-up notice of the appointment(s) by an alternate means no less than 48 hours before the scheduled appointment. The Contractor must also post a copy of the Veterans' appointment notification letter to the Contractor's website. There is no preferred file format at this time but the Contractor's site must be 508-compliant.

5.  Contractor shall provide examining physicians, examination facilities, available lab testing, and necessary support staff.  Contractor shall also provide general medical administrative services to include: scheduling examinations; providing notification to the individual to be examined; and electronic transmission of examination reports. Contractor shall provide a copy of the examination notice letter documenting the mailing address used for any examination cancelled for failure of an individual to report for examination (or certification of telephone notification).

6.	The Contractor shall provide physician(s) with a copy of the Veteran's medical records, if applicable or required by VA, prior to the examination in a secure, electronic manner.  If applicable, the contractor shall scan the entire contents of the claims file to be transmitted to the physician(s) electronically. For examinations not being processed through the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) and/or Virtual VA, the Contractor will be sent the hard copy of the Veterans' claims folders. 

For non-VBMS requests, the VARO shall send the Veterans' claims folders to the Contractor within four workdays of the exam request. For VBMS requests, the VA will have the medical records available in VBMS within 4 business days of the exam request.  If the claims folders are not received or made available through VBMS within seven calendar days after exam request, the examination request may be cancelled by the Contractor. 

Contractor shall return the Veterans' claims folders to their originating source in the same order in which they were received not later than five workdays after completion of the requested examination in the same condition in which they were sent; e.g., stapled items must be re-stapled together in the same manner, order, etc. 

The Contractor shall ensure that the records are returned via a secure, traceable mailing method. Upon completion of the examination, the contractor shall also make the scanned electronic copy available for VA to obtain and upload into its Virtual VA system. 

A claims file will not be sent to the Contractor for every examination request.   

In cases where a service member and/or Veteran presents medical records to the examiner provider, the service member and/or Veteran shall be directed to send those records to their appropriate VARO, and the provider shall not review the file unless provided by the VARO. If this is a service member going through the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), the service member should be directed to give this information to their Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officer (PEBLO), and the provider shall not review the file unless provided by the VARO/MSC. If the veteran or service member, the results submit recent test results to the VA will be forwarded to QTC and should be reviewed by the provider, at no additional cost to the VA.  Diagnostic tests should not be repeated unless there is indication of recent changes in the condition examined. Any test conducted within a twelve month period prior to the current examination shall be considered recent and sufficient. A copy of test results pertinent to the conditions evaluated by the physician shall be submitted to VA along with completed exam reports.

a.	C-Files will not be shipped for examinations requested under the Veterans Benefits Management Systems (VBMS) examination setting or as otherwise denoted in the examination request as having medical records available in VBMS. For claim types requested under the VBMS exam setting, the contractor shall access C-Files electronically through VBMS as opposed to receiving hard copy C-Files from the Regional Office. C-Files will not be shipped for examination requests under the BDD, JE, QS, or IDES exam setting where the request specifically denotes the request as being a VBMS request. This shall be noted in the "Comments Regarding the Veteran" section of the examination request and will clearly state "This is a VBMS request. No C-file will be shipped."

b.	VA will issue PIV Cards and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the contractor.
"	PIV Cards will be granted only to those who require access and those that have been NACI approved by the VA
"	GFE will consist of PIV Cards and laptops. The contractor shall obtain Windows XP drivers to be compatible with printers and scanners as appropriate.
"	The transfer of the GFE from VA to the contractor will be coordinated by the  COTR or designee
"	The contractor shall keep all equipment secure and maintain an inventory of all equipment and items.
"	The contractor shall have PIV Card approved personnel utilizing the GFE laptops to access VBMS to retrieve the electronic C-Files for Original Claim types for which ordinarily a C-file hard copy would be sent. Electronic files can be saved to the contractor secured web application from the GFE. The contractor shall proceed with its internal process of indexing and providing the records to their providers.

Upon receipt of completed VBMS examination reports from the clinician, the contractor will upload the completed reports and diagnostic information into VBMS under the specific claim folder. The contractor shall follow the procedures outlined on page 3 of the QTC Process Using VBMS Job Instruction Sheet dated April 16, 2013.

7.  The Contractor must provide toll-free telephone access to its administrative office from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (EST) Monday-Friday, excluding Federal Holidays.

8.  The Contractor shall provide VA access to its secure Management Information System for real-time status information such as Veteran examination requests. Contractor shall provide information technology capability to receive on-line examination requests, messages from VACO, maintain status information accessible by VAROs and VACO, maintain completed examination reports accessible in a database for a period of not less than 18 months, and return completed transcribed examination reports electronically to VA. Contractor shall post sensitive exams (i.e. for sensitive-level claimants identified by VA) such that they are accessible only to VACO and designated VAROs. Contractor must comply with requisite VA data/privacy security policy having the same or the equivalent (or better) security controls to safeguard Veterans' sensitive personal information (SPI).

9.  Contractor shall have the capability to send and receive encrypted e-mail in accordance with VA standards. The Contractor shall provide those addresses to the VAROs and VACO. See Security section of this document.

10.  Within 60 - 90 days after contract award, Contractor will receive electronically an encrypted text file (format predetermined by the VA) containing the examination requests, and must process examination requests on a daily basis. Daily workload will fluctuate based on current VA workload trends that are always subject to change.

11.  Contractor shall resolve bills sent by mistake to Veterans or Veteran's insurance related to examinations within 10 days.

12.  For Contract Medical Disability Examination requests that require further clarification, the Contractor shall contact the requesting VARO Exam Coordinator &/or Military Services Coordinator (MSC). If response by VARO Exam Coordinator/ MSC is unsatisfactory and will unnecessarily delay/prevent/ interfere with completion of request obligation/s, Contractor will then notify VACO.

Requests submitted using CAATS will use the following validation and triage process:
a.	The validation process is performed by the Contractor upon receipt of the request file in the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) folder.  Electronic checks are performed to ensure that the request file is able to be processed.  Duplicate requests and requests with an invalid format and/or missing data are rejected and returned to CAATS.  Valid requests continue to the triage process.
b.	The triage process consists of a Contractor review of the request and results in one of the following actions:  Accept, Reject or Cancel.
c.	Accept:  Triage results in an acceptance of the request and Accept status is returned through a CAATS file transfer.
i.	When a request is accepted, the date of request is set to the current date.
ii.	If the triage process also identified updates to the requested worksheets, a Worksheet Addendum is created and sent through a CAATS file transfer.
d.	Reject:  Triage results in rejection of the request and Reject status along with rationale for the action is returned through a CAATS file transfer.
i.	The VA can rework the request and resubmit it through the CAATS file transfer.  It is treated as a new request and undergoes the validation and triage process. 
e.	Cancel:  Triage results in cancellation of the request.  In order to cancel the request it is first accepted and then cancelled.  These actions are sent separately through a CAATS file transfer. 
f.	Automatic Accept:  The Contractor automatically accepts Requests if status is not updated (either Accept, Reject or Cancel) after 3 full business days have elapsed.  For example, a request is received on Monday and if the status has not been updated by Thursday evening, the request is automatically set to Accept status and returned through a CAATS file transfer. Business days are defined as Monday through Friday and exclusive of Federal holidays. 

13.  Contractor shall provide VA with an electronic version of their monthly invoices to the VA project manager for payment processing containing the following information: a list of services performed (an invoice, segregated by CLIN), including examination category or categories, tests completed with related Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, descriptive titles and associated fees.
 
14.  Contractors shall provide the name and contact information of a primary Point of Contact (POC) for each VARO. POCs can serve as the primarily liaison with multiple VAROs as long as there is sufficient coverage in this regard for each region supported as a result of the contract. 

15.  Examiners shall meet with Veterans within one (1) hour of scheduled appointment time.  Contractor shall investigate tardiness and habitual delays with physicians and take corrective action to eliminate or minimize future delays. 
16. The contractor shall follow the instructions on the worksheets.  If the worksheet requires an examiner to conduct an examination of a Veteran or service member to determine suitability for a particular diagnostic test, then the contractor shall not schedule such diagnostic test prior to the Veteran's or service member's examination. 
17. Contractor must be prepared to comply with requests for information, including those originating from Congress, using company letterhead, complete sentences, and professional English.

18.  Contractor shall comply with the requests of Government and independent auditors during audits of this contract and all associated contract documentation, including but not limited to invoices and medical disability examinations.

19.  Contractor shall prepare an emergency action plan for inclement weather or natural disasters for all scheduled exams in the region affected. 

20.  Contractor shall limit requests for rescheduling of any appointment(s) to one (1). Veterans and service members (including MSCs and PEBLOs who may request the reschedule on behalf of the service member) will have only one opportunity to request any or all appointment(s) to be rescheduled, unless otherwise requested and approved by VACO. If the Veteran or service member fails to show/or the rescheduled appointment(s), the Contractor notifies the VARO/military installation, the examination request will be considered "cancelled," the Contractor will invoice as a complete or partial no-show as applicable for that appointment(s), and the Veteran/service member must file a new request through the VARO/military installation.

EXAMINATION REQUIREMENTS

1.  All examinations shall be conducted in accordance with VA-issued examination worksheets specified in the examination request. The examination worksheets provide detailed examination requirements based upon legislative and court mandated criteria for VA disability entitlement determinations. Changes may be made periodically to the examination worksheets to reflect changing regulatory or medical requirements. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will notify the Contractor's Program Manager in writing when changes occur. Within 60 days of notification and provision of required information for file transfers, Contractor shall accommodate all technical changes without revision of the price schedule unless the change results in the provision of a new service for which pricing had not already been established.  Revisions to the VLER DAS file transfer (See Section Z) requirements for changes to existing DBQs and for the release of new DBQs will be reviewed upon receipt and Contractor will notify VA if price schedule updates are required.

2.  All test and procedures the examination worksheets require shall be conducted unless not medically advisable or declined by the individual examined.  The examination report must detail and document any reason for not performing a requested test or study.  Waivers for declined tests must be attached to the exams upon submission to VA. VA will not be providing a specific waiver form. Tests listed in the examination worksheets represent guidelines.  Additional standard tests may be used to establish a diagnosis or severity of disability.  Any additional tests necessary to establish a diagnosis or to determine severity of disease or injury shall also be conducted.  No invasive procedure shall be performed without the prior approval of all of the following entities: the requesting office, the individual to be examined, and the VARO and VACO.

3.  If recent test results are documented in the record and available to the examining physician for review, those tests need not be repeated unless specifically requested by the VARO or there is indication of recent changes in the condition examined.  Unless otherwise specified in the examination worksheets, any tests conducted within a twelve-month period prior to the current examination shall be considered recent and sufficient.

4.  All claimed conditions identified on the examination request MUST be examined.  All questions included in the examination worksheet must be answered.  If the answer is either yes or no, a clear statement must be included explaining why a definitive answer could not be provided and specifying the probability of a positive response with a statement of the evidentiary basis for that assumption.  A diagnosis must be provided or a statement included that the claimed condition was not found for each condition specified in the examination request.  If a diagnosis cannot either be established or ruled out, the findings must be documented with a clear statement of why a diagnosis could not be established.  

A statement that a diagnosis could not be established because additional tests are required will not be an acceptable reason for returning an examination without establishing a diagnosis or providing a statement that the claimed condition was not found.  Unless the required tests were not medically advisable or are declined by the individual examined, incomplete reports that include a statement of this nature will be deemed unacceptable.  

If a diagnosis is established which is different than an existing diagnosis for the same condition, the two diagnoses must be reconciled with a statement documenting the basis for change of diagnosis and whether the new diagnosis represents a progression of an earlier diagnosis, correction of a prior incorrect diagnosis, or a new independent entity.

5.  The Contractor shall return corrected insufficient examination reports and requests for clarification on inadequate examination reports to the VA within 14 calendar days without additional charge to VA.  The only exception will be for charges incurred due to additional tests authorized by VA. VA will send a CAATS file transfer to the Contractor indicating that the examination report is either insufficient or inadequate and include the specifics on the reason for return.  Insufficient examination reports are those that do not meet the examination Compensation and Pension (C&P) Worksheets and Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQ) requirements (i.e. no diagnosis, no testing performed, etc.)  Inadequate examination reports returned for clarification, correction, or completion will be amended and returned without additional charge.  See paragraph W, Performance Review Standards (PRS). All IDES examination requests for clarification, insufficient or inadequate, from DOD must be submitted through CAATS and sent to the contractor through the daily examination request transfer file. The contractor will expedite the processing of the request for all IDES cases. Specifically, these requests will be expedited and are requested to be completed in no more than 5 business days from the date of receipt. If a clarification is required due to omission of a claim/referred condition within the original examination request, a new examination request for the added condition must be submitted for which the contractor will invoice accordingly.

6.  Evaluation of musculo-skeletal conditions for functional loss of movement requires a minimum observation of three repetitions at the joint being examined.  

7.  Use of Goldmann Bowl Perimeter Testing is required for visual field tests. (The contractor can use other modern kinetic or automated perimetry devices but the resulting chart has to be translated on a Goldmann Bowl perimetry chart. The visual field will be tested only in cases of diplopia and/or blurred vision. The dry eye and visual deficits corrected with eyeglasses are not eligible for a Goldmann Bowl Test.   

8.  Comprehensive General Medical Examinations must document a complete review of each system. 

9.  Audiology exams will take place in a soundproof booth, as set forth in OSHA Standard 1910.95 App D.

10.  At the Veteran's request, family members, caregivers, and significant others are permitted to accompany the Veteran during an examination but may not participate in and/or interfere with the examination. Only service animals are permitted.

11.  The contractor shall schedule appointments for no less than the time length specified below for each type of Examination:

a.	Comprehensive General Medical Examination: 60 minutes 
b.	Detailed Examination - Level I: 45 minutes 
c.	Detailed Examination - Level II: 30 minutes 
d.	Initial Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) examinations: 90 minutes
e.	Audiology: 30 minutes
f.	Dental: 30 minutes
g.	Ophthalmology: 30 minutes
h.	Ear/Nose/Throat: 30 minutes  
i.	Psychiatry: 60 minutes 
j.	Musculoskeletal: 45 minutes
k.	Infectious/Immune/Nutritional Diseases: 45 minutes

t.	Neurologic: 45 minutes

The described schedule includes face-to-face time between the physician/audiologist/dentist/psychologist/psychiatrist/optometrist/ophthalmologist and Veteran. The number of disabilities to be examined determines the time frame needed as well as the criteria of the C&P examination worksheets.  The time frames are what VA finds are the minimum amounts of time to be expected in order to evaluate the disabilities appropriately.  Times are reflective of the times associated with CPT codes 99203 (30 minutes) 99204 (45 minutes) and 99205 (60 minutes). Changes in the allotted time for these CPT codes will result in changes in allotted time for Veteran appointments. There is no required scheduling timeframe for review PTSD examinations. Psychiatric testing is to only be performed as necessary for initial and review PTSD examinations.
TBI will include a "comprehensive medical evaluation" which would be 60 minutes, and the psychiatric/ cognitive or mental evaluation part of the TBI exam would be expected to be a separate 90 minutes, if an initial PTSD exam is needed.
	12.  Completed examination reports shall include an indication of the examiner's credentials (e.g. "MD" if performed by Medical Doctor) and signature. The person signing the examination shall have been the person who conducted the examination and the credentials HAVE TO appear in signature too, not only printed on the DBQ. Electronic signature is acceptable for examination reports.  
13.  The Contractor shall ensure that examination reports are adequate and in compliance with the examination request worksheets with review of test results by examiners documented, and any discrepancies resolved. 
14.  The Contractor shall document in the examination report that all gynecological, rectal/anal, and breast examinations are performed by a physician in the presence of an assistant.
15.  The Contractor shall forward to VA completed examination reports no later than 38-calendar days from receipt.  See paragraph W, PRS. Photographs shall be delivered within 24 hours of the report delivery date.
16.  The Contractor's examination quality shall be no less than 92% sufficient, which VACO staff will measure quarterly through sampling.  Quality will be determined based on completed examinations with all questions completely addressed and answered from the C&P examination worksheets; proper worksheets utilized; proper tests, procedures, laboratory work, and x-rays utilized; and correct billing codes and CLINs for examinations, tests, procedures, laboratory work, and x-rays utilized. See paragraph W, PRS. 
17.  The Contractor shall alert the Veteran or service member of any abnormal finding during the examination which the Veteran or service member should follow-up with their primary physician.
18.  Conform to the CFR below; the Contractor is hired on behalf of the VA Secretary, as a result cannot perform Independent Medical Opinion exams. 
The Routine Medical Opinion is part of the exam and is considered one DBQ, which will add to the number of DBQs and be billed as part of CLIN level I or II depending on the total number of DBQs for the examination provided. (Please see as a reference the literature below). 
Routine Medical Opinions 
Under the provisions of the 38 U.S.C. 5103A (d). Medical examinations for compensations claim: 
1. In the case of a claim for disability compensation, the assistance provided by the Secretary under subsection (a) Shall include providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim.
2. The Secretary shall treat an examination or opinion as being necessary to make a decision on a claim for purposes of paragraph (1) if the evidence of record before the Secretary, taking it into consideration all information and lay or medical evidence. (2.) does not contain sufficient medical evidence for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.
Medical opinions requested under the above statue are to be provided by VA and contract clinicians, and are part of the normal claims process. 
Independent Medical Opinions
Under the provisions of the 38 U.S.C. 5109, VA may request an expert medical opinion. In addition to that available in the Department, when it is considered to be warranted by the medical complexity or controversy involved in a particular case being considered. These advisory medical opinions will be obtained from one or more independent medical experts who are not employees of the Department (emphasis added).
The provision of the 38 CFR 3.328 set out the requirements for an independent medical opinion:
3.328 Independent medical opinions
(a)	General. When warranted by the medical complexity or controversy involved in pending claim, an advisory medical opinion may be obtained from one or more medical experts who are not employees of VA. Opinions shall be obtained from recognized medical schools, universities, clinics or medical institutions with which arrangements for such opinions have been made, and an appropriate official of the institution shall select the individual experts(s) to render an opinion. 
(b)	 Requests. A request for an independent medical opinion in conjunction with a claim pending at the regional office level may be initiated by the office having jurisdiction over the claim, by the claimant, or by his or her duly appointed representative. The request must be submitted in writing and must set forth in detail the reasons why the opinion is necessary. All such requests shall be submitted through the Veterans Service Center Manager or Pension Management Center Manager of the office having jurisdiction over the claim, and those requests which in the judgment of the Veterans Service Center Manager or Pension Management. Center Management merit consideration shall be referred to the Compensation Service of the Pension Fiduciary Service for approval. 
Medical Opinions
It is clear from the statue and regulations above, that a request for an independent medical opinion can only be initiated by the regional office having jurisdiction over the claim the Veteran or the Veteran's duly appointed representative. If warranted in the judgment of the VSCM or Pension Management Center Management, the request must be referred to the Compensation or Pension Service for approval. If approved, the medical opinion will be provided by a qualified expert who is not an employee of VA or hired contractor by the VA to serve the Veterans interests. 
19.  The Agent Orange three presumptive conditions, Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Hairy Cell/B-Cell Leukemia (HCL/BCL), Screening  IMO (CLIN 0033). The contractor shall review the C-File Folder submitted for review and determine whether a disability request for the Agent Orange three presumptive conditions was previously made and can be construed as a disability request from the claimant.  In addition, the contractor will identify if a grant of the Agent Orange three presumptive conditions was awarded, or if a previous disability request for the Agent Orange three presumptive conditions was denied between September 25, 1985, to August 31, 2010. 

a. The contractor shall review the entire claims folder and provide any additional information as to whether the Veteran in question qualifies for consideration as a Nehmer class member, based on the manifestation of the Agent Orange three presumptive conditions since the completion of military service in Vietnam, or actual exposure to herbicides during Vietnam military service.

b. The contractor shall provide a completed document Titled:  The Agent Orange Screening Checklist Review Template (please see Attachment C) which will include all necessary information required for the review.

c. This template is a completely different document than the existing DBQs for the three presumptive conditions, Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Hairy Cell/B-Cell Leukemia, (HCL/BCL) and the IMO DBQ. At the moment, there is no Agent Orange Worksheet/DBQ that encompasses all three conditions.

d. The contractor shall segregate and bill appropriately between the IMO (CLIN 0022) and the Agent Orange Screening IMO (CLIN 0033) in accordance with the Price Schedule. Both documents are examiner produced written documents required beyond the normal scope of an examination, and both documents are explicitly requested by the VAROs.  The Agent Orange three presumptive conditions- IMO is completed after the examiner has reviewed the Veteran's disability requests and medical record and The Agent Orange Screening Checklist Review Template. Once submitted it shall be billed in accordance with the Agent Orange Screening IMO (CLIN 0033).

	20. Peripheral Neuropathy Screening IMO (CLIN 0034).  The contractor shall review the Veteran's disability requests and medical evidence folder (C-file hardcopy or electronic) submitted for review and determine whether a disability request for Peripheral Neuropathy was previously made and can be construed as a disability request from the claimant.  In addition, the contractor will identify if a grant of Peripheral Neuropathy was awarded, or if a previous disability request for Peripheral Neuropathy was denied between September 25, 1985 and the date of the grant.

a. The contractor shall review the entire disability request folder (C-file) and provide any additional information as to whether the Veteran in question qualifies for consideration as a Nehmer class member based on the manifestation of Peripheral Neuropathy within one (1) year of completion of military service in Vietnam, or actual exposure to herbicides during Vietnam military service.

b. The contractor shall provide a completed document titled:  Agent Orange (AO) Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) Review Checklist (please see Attachment G) which will include all necessary information required for the review.  This document is different from the existing Peripheral Neuropathy DBQ and the IMO DBQ.  Currently, there is no Peripheral Neuropathy Worksheet/DBQ.

c. The contractor shall segregate and bill appropriately between the IMO (CLIN 0022) and the Peripheral Neuropathy IMO (CLIN 0034) in accordance with the Price Schedule. Both documents are examiner produced written documents required beyond the normal scope of an examination, and both documents are explicitly requested by the VAROs. The Peripheral Neuropathy IMO is completed after the examiner has reviewed the Veteran's disability requests and medical record and completed the Peripheral Neuropathy Review Template. Once submitted it shall be billed in accordance with the Peripheral Neuropathy IMO (CLIN 0034).

1. Evidence required to be reviewed includes, but is not limited to, the DD214/separation documents; all Service Treatment Records (STRs); Outpatient and inpatient treatment records, and overall, the full-claims' folder or "C-file". The size and volume of the claims folder is unique to each Veteran's claims history within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).  Some records may be only a few pages, while others may include multiple pages.

2. Multiple exams by different doctors in the same practice that occur on the same day are reimbursable by VA.  Same day appointments are allowed to expedite the claims process and prevent unnecessary travel by claimants.

3. Number of x-rays performed in one day can be more than allowed by Medicare to expedite the claims process. The VA encourages multiple same day appointments to expedite the claims process and improve timeliness of the claims. The scheduling of these appointments on the same day is expected to take into account the location of different appointments and accessibility of the claimants to attend all appointments in a timely manner. 

4. Earwax removal at same appointment as audiology exam/testing: Again for the convenience of the claimants and to expedite the claims process, VA is in favor of audiologists/ENT physicians who note earwax impaction at time of the C&P exam removing the cerumen and proceeding with the audiology/ear exam if possible. This practice expedites the claims process rather than sending claimant to a different doctor or back to their own treating physician/audiologist to remove the wax prior to the audiology exam.  Under these circumstances, Earwax removal - CPT 69210, would be allowed and reimbursed with CPT 92557, Comprehensive audiology testing and CLIN 0005, Complete Audiology/ENT exam.

5. According to the C& P Audiology worksheet, the Air Conduction and Speech testing is required. Bone Conduction is also required if Air Conduction threshold is greater than 15dB. The Contractor shall use CPT Code 92557 to invoice all Audiological testing regardless of whether Bone Conduction threshold is required to be performed.

6. Incorporate Medicare Approved National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits in the invoicing of CPT codes.  The NCCI edits are used in accordance with a Medicare Fee Schedule, which is published annually, and are revised on a regular basis.

<DESC><p>The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is the country's primary source of nationally representative, comprehensive person level data on health care use and expenses. The Household Component of the MEPS (HC) collects information on health care use, insurance coverage, access to care and other key data for a nationally representative sample of persons and families. The Medical Provider Component (MPC) of the MEPS collects information on expenses and payments for care from providers identified as sources of medical care use by participants in the MEPS HC. The Medical Organization Survey (MOS) will collect essential information on the provider's staffing, organization and policies for up to 6,000 of the MPC ambulatory care providers who are the Household Component respondent's usual source of medical care. To gain the expected analytic utility from this additional activity, linkages between the MEPS HC, MPC and MOS must be carefully maintained throughout data collection and processing. <br /><br />The current contract with AHRQ (HHSA290201300007C) is to conduct the MEPS Medical Provider Survey. This sole source modification will add two option periods to the existing contract. Option Period G will finalize the design of the survey, and will be concurrent with Option Year 2. Option Period H will collect the data and prepare the analytic files. Option Period H will be concurrent with Option Year 3.<br />RTI has been conducting the Medical Provider Component of the MPC since 2008. RTI has experience with the complex linkages in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the specific procedures that need to be in place to un-duplicate the identified providers and link them back to the Household Component. RTI has been collecting data from medical providers in the context of the MEPS for the past six years and has collected data from more than 100,000 MEPS ambulatory care providers.<br /><br />AHRQ requires seamless continuation of the MPC and MOS data collection, file development and linkage back to the MEPS Household Component data. RTI is the only contractor that can do the work to maintain the quality, validity, and consistency of the data. The use of another contractor would significantly increase the possibility of disruption to the quality and validity of the data. Another contractor could not immediately learn the intricacies and necessary linkages and un-duplication required for the MEPS data collection which is required to provide the MOS data in a timely manner to meet the time line requirements of the MEPS public use file data release schedule. Moreover, a new contractor would not have the background knowledge necessary for a consistent and successful completion of this contract requirement. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government as to whether or not to compete this proposed modification action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties regarding this sole source action may contact the Contract Specialist, Robert Zuhlke, at Robert.zuhlke@ahrq.hhs.gov, no later than 10:00 am ET on February 6, 2015. The final Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC)/Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) supporting this sole source action will publicly be made available as required after contract modification award.</p>

<SUBJECT>Continuation of the Year of the Research Leader Initiative
<SOLNBR>AG-32SB-S-15-TH001
<RESPDATE>020115
<CONTACT>Travis Heller, Email travis.heller@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis a contract with Gilburg Leadership, Inc., 110 Lincoln Street, Holyoke, MA 01040-1610, to provide the continuation of the "Year of the Research Leader" initiative. ARS requires consultation and facilitative support for the ongoing planning, coordination and-where appropriate-facilitation of all aspects of the Initiative as outlined: Steering Team Meetings, Webinar and Cohort Discussion Group Coordination Meetings, Planning Team Meetings, Planning Team Retreat, YRL Conference, Sub Team Facilitation/Support, and General Research, Planning &amp; Consultation.</p>
<p>The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Services are be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in: (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and/or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B).).</p>
<p>This work is a logical follow-on task to multiple previous USDA ARS orders which supports a prior phase of the Administrator's Office and Research Leader initiative. Preserving continuity of work and sustaining unique institutional knowledge are critical success factors for the initiative. Award to another firm would impose a steep learning curve, with cost in time and dollars to be borne by the government. Any break in continuity would put the government at risk of missing current and upcoming deadlines for recommendations and determination of next steps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, there would be a ripple effect of further delays in subsequent planning and implementation of those recommendations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The existing contractor also possesses critical insights into principal issues and factors currently being weighed as recommendations are being drafted and reviewed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Loss of clarity in these areas could cause harm by: affecting the quality of final work products of the current project team; and causing disruption in transition to upcoming project work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The content knowledge acquired through the previous tasks, coupled with working relationships that have been built, are essential elements needed to make a seamless transition to the next phase of the initiative.</p>
<p>Anticipated Date of Award: 02/02/2015</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. </strong>This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS) anticipates awarding a five (5) year Firm Fixed Price, sole source contract (base year plus 4 options) for the  Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) of the 120mm M931 Full Range Practice Cartridges (FRPC) and the M933A1 and M934A1 High Explosive (HE) Mortar Cartridges Ammunition to American Ordnance (AO), who is the operator of the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP).  This sole source contract is intended to be issued using 10 USC 2304(c) (3) as authorized by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i); Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services, to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization.  Awarding to IAAAP will allow the Government to continue the viability of the organic base and ultimately the effectiveness of America's defense industrial base as a whole. It will also help IAAAP maintain the capability to melt-pour medium and large caliber ammunition, which will allow the Army to have the ability to equip, sustain, and support troops and contingency operations at times of war for mobilization and potential surge requirements. This procurement provides the Army and industrial base a greater flexibility, which is required in an uncertain future by ensuring a responsive production capability at an Army Ammunition Plant.  This award also ensures the continued viability of the IAAAP LAP facility, its supplier base and vital facilities in the event of national emergency.    <br>  <br> The M931 FRP Mortar Cartridge utilizes an M781 Point Detonation Fuze which detonates upon impact and provides flash bang and smoke signature for training.   <br>  <br> The M933A1 and M934A1 High Explosive Mortar Cartridges are fuzed high explosive cartridges, intended for use against personnel and materiel targets, and provide fragmentation and blast effects.  The M933A1 and M934A1 Mortar Cartridges utilize a M783 Point Detonating/Delay (PD/DLY) Fuze and M734A1 Multi-Option (MO) Fuze, respectively.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION<br />FOR SOLE SOURCE<br />IAW FAR 13.501(a)(ii)<br />________________________________________
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development<br />Office of Policy Development &amp; Research (PD&amp;R) <br />451 7th Street, SW, Room 8120<br />Washington, DC 20140</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: Request approval of a sole source award to Moody's Analytics Services, for providing economic, demographic and housing data subscriptions.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY'S NEEDS (INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE): The service required is to provide economic, demographic and housing data subscriptions to a database that contains the most complete data and tools for analyzing the multi-family housing market nationwide.</p>
<p>These data and research products will be used by HUD's field economists in the Economic and Market Analysis Division (EMAD) in their ongoing studies of local housing market conditions. The local market analysis is of particular benefit to HUD's field economists, who are responsible for providing evaluations of local housing and community development related proposals.</p>
<p>The Government estimates the value of this acquisition to be $196,100 for a base and 1 option.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii): under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) or the authority of the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a) - Sole Source (including brand name) Acquisitions.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AUTHORITY CITED: Moody Analytics Services at Economy.com provides data and analysis at the metropolitan, regional and state levels, which is extremely valuable to field economists. In addition, Economy.com updates their information and databases on a monthly basis which provides timely and real time information to HUD's field economists. The Housing Market Monitor and Pr&eacute;cis reports will provide demographic, economic and housing data as well as analyses that are unique to Economy.com. The Pr&eacute;cis reports combine all necessary data that HUD's field economists need to analyze a housing market into one easy to access report. Other providers of multi-family data do not update information on a monthly basis, hence cannot provide access to real time up to date information to HUD field economists when they need it. Moody's Analytics Services at Economy.com is the sole provider of a subscription to a database that contains the most complete data and tools for analyzing the multi-family housing market nationwide.</p>
<p>Moody's Analytics Services is exclusively a United States firm and other than a small business.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES: Notice of intent to sole source was posted to the GPE on August 28, 2014. See paragraph 8 for results of the Notice of Intent.<br /><br />7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: It is expected the annual price will be not be higher than that available commercially or afforded to other Moody's Analytics customers.</p>
<p>8. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH EFFORTS CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: This requirement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. A Notice of Intent to Sole Source was posted on FedBizOpps on August 28, 2014 with a response required by September 8, 2014. The purpose for the notice was to determine if there were any other businesses with the capability to provide economic, demographic and housing data subscriptions to a database that contains the most complete data and tools for analyzing the multi-family housing market nationwide, and to determine whether this acquisition could be set-aside for small businesses. There were no responses to the posted notice. It has subsequently been determined that no contractor other than Moody's Analytics Services is capable of providing these services without unacceptable program delays and diminished program effectiveness.</p>
<p>The market research conducted by EMAD economists and technical experts, and the procurement office indicates that no other providers were found who offered the same amount of data covering all the variables provided by Economy.com, or unique analysis in the same format as Economy.com. In addition, Economy.com updates their information and databases on a monthly basis which provides real time information to HUD's field economists. The Housing Market Monitor and Pr&eacute;cis reports will provide economic, demographic and housing data that are unique to Economy.com.</p>
<p>9. OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. WHEN 6.302-1 IS CITED FOR FOLLOW-ON ACQUISITIONS AS DESCRIBED IN 6.302-1(A)(2)(ii), AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD BE DUPLICATED AND HOW THE COST WAS DERIVED: N/A</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF THE SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: None<br />11. STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) will work closely with PD&amp;R to monitor the commercial market for new sources that become available to provide economic, demographic and housing data subscription database that contains the most complete data and tools for analyzing the multi-family housing market nationwide.</p>
<p>12. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION: I certify that the facts contained in this justification are complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>Request for the Operation of the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET)
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation, intends to award a sole source one (1) year bridge contract to the current provider, AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, Inc., to provide monitoring services of the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET), which has been used to characterize trends in deposition levels and atmospheric concentrations of air pollutants and their precursors.  This includes requirements to operate and maintain 90 CASTNET monitoring stations that provide air quality and atmospheric deposition data for 39 states and Ontario, Canada.  The contractor will provide all materials, supplies, services and utilities necessary for the operation of these stations, and collect and ship air quality samples to the laboratory.  The contractor will also maintain the inventory and tracking system for over 30,000 parts and eq uipment owned by EPA.  EPA requires the contractor to electronically obtain air quality and meteorological data from all EPA monitoring stations and submit this data to EPA on a daily basis.
On March 2011, EPA's Forum on Environmental Measurements (FEM) issued a policy titled, "Policy to Assure Competency of Laboratories, Field Sampling, and Other Organizations Generating Environmental Measurement Data under Agency-Funded Acquisitions," which can be located at the following link:
http://www.epa.gov/fem/pdfs/fem-lab-competency-policy.pdf
This policy mandates that any organization generating environmental data under Agency funded acquisitions must submit documentation of their competency, which shall include participation in applicable certification and/or accreditation programs.  Laboratory methods (accreditations) that are required under the CASTNET scope of work include all seven (7) of the following:
*	EPA 300.0 (Modified) Determination of Inorganic Anions By IC *	EPA 350.1 (Modified) Determination of Ammonia/Ammonium by AC *	EPA 6010B (Modified) Determination of Inorganic Cations by ICP-OES *	EPA 150.1 Determination of Hydrogen Ion (pH) *	EPA 120.1 Determination of Specific Conductance *	EPA QA Guidance 2.12 40 CFR Part 50, App L Determination of PM2.5-PM10 *	EPA QA Guidance 2.11 40 CFR Part 50, App J Determination of PM10
Therefore, pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2), which implements 41 U.S.C. 254(c)(1), AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, Inc., is the only responsible source and is the only US laboratory that has been certified in all methods required by the CASTNET scope of work.  This requirement includes the FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services clause.
EPA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the Government's best interest. If there are other potential sources, submit your interest in strict accordance with these instructions below.
No solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP) is available for this procurement. Nevertheless, any company or individual that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a capabilities statement and evidence of a current accreditations to cover from now through a minimum of January 30, 2016 (estimated end date of bridge contract) but also specify accreditation date beyond this minimum; which, if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be submitted via e-mail with an email subject "Capability Statement & Proof of Accreditation for CASTNET" as no phone calls will be accepted.  A determination not to compete the described bridge contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.

<SOLNBR>W912DW15P0026
<ARCHDATE>01222016
<CONTACT>Monique A. Paano, 206-764-6084

<a href="mailto:monique.a.paano@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Seattle</a>
<DESC>SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT <br> 1.  Introduction <br>  <br> The USACE Seattle District intends to award a sole source contract to Bonner County Sheriff's Office.  Bonner County, Idaho. <br>  <br> 2.  Description of Services <br>  <br> The Bonner County Sheriff's Department (County) shall provide services to the Government on lands administered by the Corps of Engineers in the vicinity of Albeni Falls Dam (the Project).  The described services will provide security emphasis patrols after normal Corps duty hours at and around key facilities on the Project during periods of routine surveillance and generalized threat, and provide for a continuing law enforcement presence during periods of specific threat or incident.   <br>  <br> The County shall provide the necessary certified personnel, equipment, and vehicles or vessels required to provide patrols in the Project area.  For purposes of this contract, the Project area is defined as including:  the powerhouse, spillway, transformer yard, switchyard, shops and storage areas, the Visitor Center and adjacent communications building, and all associated roads, parking areas, and access points (including the south end of the spillway accessed from the Abeni Cove Road).  The Project area is located 4 miles west of Priest River, Idaho on U.S. Highway #2, and effectively includes all areas accessed from Highway #2 on Project roads. <br>  <br> The NAICS code is 922120. <br>  <br> 3.  Authority <br>  <br> DFARS 206.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. <br>  <br> 4.  Reasons for Sole Source <br> 	(a)  Background:  After the events of September 11, 2001, the Federal Government authorized the use of law enforcement to make emphasis patrols to protect project areas such as Albeni Falls Dam.  Memorandum for Records:  Application of 10 U.S.C. 2465 to Civil Works Projects and Facilities dated September 24, 2001 and Memorandum for Record:  Law Enforcement Services at Corps Water Resources Development Projects Under 42 U.S.C. 1962d-5d dated November 2, 2005, document the authorities and legal opinions allowing for law enforcement emphasis patrols during non-duty hours for projects like Albeni Falls Dam. <br>  <br> 	(b)  Justification:  The Bonner County Sheriff's Department is the only law enforcement agency having the authority and capability to provide the services required on Albeni Falls' Project areas.  They have full authority to enforce, and make arrests if necessary, local, state, and federal laws on lands and waters associated with the Project (concurrent jurisdiction) and are staffed and equipped to do so on a sustained basis.  Deputies who will be providing the services are trained law enforcement officers with the ability to patrol and monitor Project facilities, but more importantly, the authority to take formal action in the event of unlawful or terrorist activity at the Corps facilities.  Deputies are available around the clock and are based in the City of Priest River, which is close to the Project area.  Response time to emergency situations is between five and fifteen minutes under normal conditions.  This fast response time is critical to the safety of Corps employees and the public in today's environment.  The Bonner County Sheriff also has the ability to call in other agencies to support contracted activities or react to emergencies and security incidents. <br>  <br> 5.  No solicitation package will be issued.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC><p><br />The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications from qualified candidates, interested in providing the personal services described in the attached solicitation. Submissions shall be in accordance with the attached information at the place and time specified therein.</p>
<p>The objective of the contract is to obtain the services of a Senior Health Systems Strengthening Advisor who will provide management, leadership, and technical services on the full range of HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING (HSS) investments. The Senior Health Systems Strengthening Advisor serves as the Team Leader for the Health Systems Strengthening team - one of four teams that work under the overall direction of the OPH Director. Strategic planning, design, evaluation, coordination with development partners and GOK, representation and partner oversight will be critical elements of the position. As a USAID contract employee, the incumbent has the responsibility of understanding and incorporating the Agency's five core values in all aspects of his/her work. These core values are: (1) customer focus, (2) managing for results, (3) empowerment and accountability, (4) teamwork and participation, and (5) valuing diversity.</p>
<p>The incumbent will work at a senior level in a high-priority USG foreign assistance program that requires knowledge, experience, maturity, and an ability to function independently under a complex, highly demanding, frequently changing environment. The position is located in the Office of Population and Health, USAID/Kenya, in Nairobi, Kenya. She/he will advise USAID/Kenya on all aspects of health systems strengthening as it relates to the technical areas: family planning, maternal and child health, nutrition, tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. The incumbent will represent USAID at the highest government and donor levels. The incumbent will supervise approximately four Foreign Service National positions.</p>
<p>The Senior Health Systems Strengthening Advisor will report to the OPH Deputy Director, who provides overall operational oversight and supervision. Given the integrated nature of OPH, the heavy emphasis on inter-agency collaboration, and strong linkages with the GOK and private sector, it will be essential for the incumbent to demonstrate strong technical and management skills, complemented by outstanding communication and interpersonal skills. Donor collaboration is, equally, a critical function under this position.<br /><br />Sustainability is a central tenet of the HSS team, requiring that capacity is built in the public and private sectors within a wide range of areas including but not limited to: financing and resource management at all levels, training, supply chain management, policy/advocacy, commodity security, human resources, and governance/management. The Senior Health Systems Strengthening Advisor will provide managerial oversight and technical advice to support the implementation of this program through a combination of bilateral and field support programs.<br /><br />S/he will also work closely with the other three teams (PMI, HIV/AIDS and Family Health).</p>

<a href="mailto:jesse.l.onkka@usace.army.mil">USACE District, St. Paul</a>
<DESC>Lock and Dam 5A <br> Miter Gate Repair by Heat Straightening <br> Scope of Work <br> 1. General.  The contractor shall provide all plant, labor and material to repair bent webs and flanges of the vertical miter girder member through heat straightening. <br> 2. Repair Areas.  The downstream intermediate wall miter gate was damaged as the result of a tow boat impact several years ago.  The miter girder (last girder towards the centerline of the lock chamber) was left with an approximate four inch permanent distortion toward the lock wall on the upstream side of the member.  This distortion is limited to approximately the top 8 feet of the member directly under the top horizontal girder.  This permanent deflection does not allow the miter contact blocks to meet as intended.  The miter girder is a built up member made up of 3/8 inch thick web plate and L 6 x 4 x   flange angles.  These components are riveted together. See attached photographs and as-built drawings.  They are comprised of 1930s vintage ASTM A 7 steel.  Required yield strength was specified as 33,000 pounds per square inch.  See attached as-built drawing and damage photos.  <br> 3. Required Relevant Experience.  The Contractor shall have at least 10 years experience in conducting heat straightening repairs for damaged steel structures.  During the preceding three year period, the Contractor shall have conducted an average of at least five heat straightening projects per year.  The personnel conducting the heat straightening must have a minimum of 5 years experience on heat straightening projects.  Experience documentation shall include:  date of project, location, bridge owner, number and type of members straightened, and duration of the project. <br> 4. Equipment.   <br> a. Heating shall be with an oxygen-fuel combination.  The fuel provided will be acetylene.   <br> b. Heat application shall be by single or multiple orifice tips only.  The size of the tips shall be proportional to the thickness of the heated material.  As a guide, the tip sizes shown in the table below are recommended.  No cutting torch heads are permitted. <br> Steel Thickness (in)	Orifice Type	Size <br>  less than  1/4	Single	3 <br> 3/8	Single	4 <br> 1/2	Single	5 <br> 5/8	Single	7 <br> 3/4	Single	8 <br> 1	Single  <br> Rosebud	8 <br> 3 <br> 2	Single <br> Rosebud	8 <br> 4 <br>  <br>  <br> c. Jacks, come-alongs or other force application devices shall be gauged and calibrated so that the force exerted by the device may be controlled and measured.  No external force shall be applied to the structure by the Contractor unless it is measured. <br> 5. Damage Assessment.   <br> a. Suspected areas of cracking shall be called to the attention of the Government before any testing or work is performed. <br> 6. Heat Application.   <br> a. The temperature of the steel during heat straightening shall not exceed 1100 degrees Fahrenheit. <br> b. The Contractor shall use one or more of the following methods for routine, ongoing documented temperature verification during heat straightening: Temperature sensitive crayons, Pyrometer, or Infrared non-contact thermometer. <br> c. Material should be heated in a single pass and allowed to cool to below 250 degrees Fahrenheit prior to re-heating. <br> d. Vee heats shall be shifted over the yield zone on successive heating cycles. <br> e. Simultaneous vee heats may be used provided that the clear spacing between vees is greater than the width of the plate element. <br> f. Repair of previously heat straightened members in the same region of damage may be conducted once.  Further repairs of previously heat straightened members will not be conducted unless approved by the Government. <br> 7. Application of Jacking Forces. <br> 	a. Jacks shall be placed so that forces are relieved as straightening occurs during cooling. <br> 8. Field Supervision of Repair. <br> 	a. Heating temperatures shall be routinely monitored to ensure compliance with specified limits. <br> 9. Tolerances. <br> a. The dimensions of heat straightened structural members shall conform to the tolerances specified in the following table except as noted in paragraph 8. b. <br> Member Type	Minimum Tolerance <br> Beams, Truss members, or Columns <br>    Overall <br>    At Impact Point	 <br>  <br>   inch over 20 ft <br>   inch over 20 ft <br> Local Web Deviations	d/100 but not less than   inch <br> Local Flange Deviations	b/100 but not less than   inch <br> d is the depth of the member, b is the width of the flange <br> b. Relaxation of the tolerance limits will be at the discretion of the Government based on one or more of the following conditions: Type and location of damage in the member or degree of restoration required to restore structural integrity. <br> 10.

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-15-Q-200048 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS AND OEMS.

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 120 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 120 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition.  Evaluation Factors: SEE SECTION L & M INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS. <BR> <BR>The period of performance shall be for 120 days from award of contract for delivery, installation, inspection and acceptance. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010)  <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2014)<br /> (a)  Purpose.  The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br /> (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br /> (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br /> (b)  Scope.  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity.  For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br /> (c)  Warrant and Disclosure.  The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.  The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.  The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.  <br /> (d)  Remedies.  The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.  If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br /> (e)  Subcontracts.  The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br /> (f)  Prime Contractor Responsibilities.  The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.  The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.  If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g)  Waiver.  The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

This distortion is limited to approximately the top 8 feet of the member directly under the top horizontal girder. This permanent deflection does not allow the miter contact blocks to meet as intended. The miter girder is a built up member made up of 3/8 inch thick web plate and L 6 x 4 x flange angles. These components are riveted together. See attached photographs and as-built drawings. They are comprised of 1930s vintage ASTM A 7 steel. Required yield strength was specified as 33,000 pounds per square inch. See attached as-built drawing and damage photos. <br />3. Required Relevant Experience. The Contractor shall have at least 10 years experience in conducting heat straightening repairs for damaged steel structures. During the preceding three year period, the Contractor shall have conducted an average of at least five heat straightening projects per year. The personnel conducting the heat straightening must have a minimum of 5 years experience on heat straightening projects. Experience documentation shall include: date of project, location, bridge owner, number and type of members straightened, and duration of the project. <br />4. Equipment. <br />a. Heating shall be with an oxygen-fuel combination. The fuel provided will be acetylene. <br />b. Heat application shall be by single or multiple orifice tips only. The size of the tips shall be proportional to the thickness of the heated material. As a guide, the tip sizes shown in the table below are recommended. No cutting torch heads are permitted. <br />Steel Thickness (in) Orifice Type Size <br />less than 1/4 Single 3 <br />3/8 Single 4 <br />1/2 Single 5 <br />5/8 Single 7 <br />3/4 Single 8 <br />1 Single <br />Rosebud 8 <br />3 <br />2 Single <br />Rosebud 8 <br />4 <br /><br /><br />c. Jacks, come-alongs or other force application devices shall be gauged and calibrated so that the force exerted by the device may be controlled and measured. No external force shall be applied to the structure by the Contractor unless it is measured. <br />5. Damage Assessment. <br />a. Suspected areas of cracking shall be called to the attention of the Government before any testing or work is performed. <br />6. Heat Application. <br />a. The temperature of the steel during heat straightening shall not exceed 1100 degrees Fahrenheit. <br />b. The Contractor shall use one or more of the following methods for routine, ongoing documented temperature verification during heat straightening: Temperature sensitive crayons, Pyrometer, or Infrared non-contact thermometer. <br />c.

<p>* Refer to the attached CLIN Structure spreadsheet.  Please note there are two sheets to be completed in the Excel file.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for award, offerors must provide a quote for all CLINS listed.</p>
<p>USU owns patches that need be sewn on the outer left-chest pocket.  The patches are 4 X 3-1/2 X 1/8 inches [see the attached jpg picture for a sample].  USU can ship these patches to the awardee for this service.  Offerors must note that the integrity of the pocket must not be compromised.  Offerors should state in the quote package with pricing if this is a service they can provide.</p>
<p>The coats must be delivered by February 9, 2015.  If the patches can be sewn over the pocket, the coats may be delivered by February 17, 2015.  The required delivery dates for the future option years will be determined annually.  USU will disclose these dates at least two weeks prior to delivery.</p>
<p>Evaluation / Award Detail:</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a single, five-year, firm-fixed priced (FFP) purchase order (PO) to the offeror representing the best value to the Government based on the evaluation factors listed below.  Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first.  The Government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors.  The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the offeror quoting the highest technically rated item.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors (in order of importance):</p>
<p>1.	Technical.  Offerors must quote products that reflect the desired specifications outlined in the Minimum Specifications section.  To demonstrate, offerors must provide product literature for the quoted items.  Offerors must also indicate whether the required delivery date of February 9, 2015 can be met (or February 17, 2015 for the inclusion of the patch service).  If unable to meet this date, offerors must provide an alternative date when the delivery can be made.</p>
<p>We will consider those offers that do not perfectly meet our desired specs and sizes.  However, those offerors who can meet our specs and sizes will be evaluated higher than those offerors who can't.</p>
<p>2.	Price.  Offerors must include all applicable costs, e.g. shipping, in the quote.  The total quoted price for all components will be the evaluated price.  Offerors should include their preferred method of payment.  USU prefers to make payment(s) using the Visa Government Purchase Card (GPC).</p>
<p>In addition to providing the product literature, offerors must also submit a copy of the completed CLIN Structure spreadsheet* in the quote package.  Those offerors who fail to provide this copy in the quote package may be deemed nonresponsive:</p>
<p>CLINs 0001 through 0022: Consultation lab coats for women and men<br />Desired Specifications	Quoted Specification	Reference Page No. in the Quote Package/Product Literature<br />Color: White		<br />Material: Polyester/Cotton blend (at least 55% and no more than 85% polyester)		<br />Length: Waist-length		<br />Sleeves: Long		<br />Three buttons on front		<br />Two lower outer pockets		<br />One outer left-chest pocket		<br />Must in be in numeric sizing as listed in the CLIN Structure attachment (no XS, M, XL, etc.)		<br />* Refer to the attached CLIN Structure spreadsheet.  Please note there are two sheets to be completed in the Excel file.</p>
<p>Quoted items must be new.  Quotes for refurbished equipment will not be considered.</p>
<p>Offerors must also indicate in quote where item is manufactured.  Offerors may provide quotes for multiple coat models.</p>
<p>The Federal Government prefers not to use third-party-payment merchants, e.g. PayPal, to exchange currencies.  This is because these merchants can mask the actual merchant/vendor and impede the Government's effort to promote transparency.  If these third-party-payment merchants must be used, offeror must include a compelling justification in the quote package.  This will be considered as a part of the Price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>Items will be shipped to Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>See attached list for applicable provisions and clauses for this requirement.  Offerors must submit a copy of completed Required Provisions.  Failure to do so may result in the quote package being deemed nonresponsive.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>TITLE: Full Spectrum Targeting (FST)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-14-01</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers pertaining to the research, development, prototyping, integration, test and demonstration of innovative technologies, tools and practices to advance the future of the Air Force's targeting capabilities. The synergetic integration of kinetic and non-kinetic targeting across a distributed targeting enterprise will support a unified and continuous approach to analyzing a full spectrum of targets and spheres of influence (Air, Space Cyber and Social-Economic).</p>
<p><strong>Target Development, Analysis, and Assessment is the primary focus area for this BAA</strong></p>
<p>The Joint Targeting Cycle is the process that is used consistently across organizations that perform targeting-related tasks. This process consists of six phases: (1) End State/Commander's Objectives; (2) Target Development &amp; Prioritization; (3) Capabilities Analysis; (4) Commander's Decision and Force Assignment; (5) Mission Planning &amp; Force Execution; and (6) Assessment. The targeting enterprise lacks efficient workflow and data hand-offs, causing lost time, redundancy of effort, and lesser quality products and effects across air, space, &amp; cyberspace. The major processes and products relevant to target intelligence production include: Target Systems Analysis (TSA), Intermediate/Advanced Target Development (I/ATD) (Encompassing imagery preparation, target description and significance, Precise Point Mensuration (PPM), and weaponeering), Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE), Electronic Target Folder (ETF), Target Lists (TL) and Battle Damage Assessment (BDA). Development of portions or all of these intelligence products, specifically TSA, I/ATD, CDE, and BDA, are not automated and required considerable resources (time and labor) to produce. Due to the lengthy, disjointed workflow, lack of an automated production process, and limited analytical tools, these processes and accompanying products are also pre-disposed to high error rates and low production capacity. Additionally, a significant deficiency in the current Joint Targeting Cycle is the absence of non-kinetic data in the targeting products throughout. In order to synergize planning and effects across a multi-domain environment, it's essential for FST to include the full range of Cyber, Space, Directed Energy, Electronic Warfare (EW), and influence operations (e.g. Psychological Operation (PSYOPS)/ Military Information Support Operations (MISO)) data into a universal targeting workflow.</p>
<p>We seek new technologies and tools that automate and track the targeting process and workflows, improve the targeting workflow timeline, increase production capacity, enhance product quality, and incorporate Non-Kinetic data into the workflow and products.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Continuous Targeting Processes</span>: The objective in this area is to research and develop technologies that will automate the targeting workflow processing order to reduce the time and levels of effort required by targeteers to produce targeting products, increase quality and support the globally distributed production of targeting products. Challenges include but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Manage targeting resources (people, data, networks, applications, tasking) across the global targeting enterprise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Monitor global workflow status scalable from macro steps/phases of the workflow down to individual tasks and to include metrics data to support continuous process improvement<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Allow for high priority tasks to supersede lesser tasks in workflow</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target Data Management</span>: The objective of this topic is to explore, identify, and prototype innovative technologies allowing for improved data (to include Kinetic and Non-Kinetic) collection, availability, access, distribution, and quality. The goal is to help targeteers gather, assimilate, and vet relevant targeting information required to build and disseminate targeting products. Challenges include but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Global access and distribution of all requisite targeting data/products in formats that are both human and machine readable<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Store all relevant targeting data, finished products and raw data and make data available to other users in the workflow process as soon as possible/available<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Visualize and produce targeting products amenable for integration into documents or briefings (MS Office, Adobe, etc.)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Automatically search, retrieve, and populate data entry fields in specific targeting products as soon as possible/available<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Automatically request and collect pre and post-mission Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor data (Kinetic and Non-Kinetic) relating to specific targeting products as soon as possible/available<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) Improved linking of the overall campaign strategy to individual targeting tasks</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intelligence Assessment (IA)</span>: The objective in this area is to develop new technologies and prototypes that identify, combine, formulate and communicate target-related feedback and intelligence information enabling targeteers, planners and commanders a view of the success of ongoing operations from the tactical to the operational and strategic levels. Challenges include but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Cohesive assessments and decision support to measure success or failure to achieve the desired effect against individual targets and to facilitate comprehension of the total damage to entire target sets and systems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Timely determination of the campaign plan success (planned objectives versus actual results) achieved by the overall operation as measured over all friendly action against the adversary<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) The application of Kinetic and Non-Kinetic weaponeering solutions will require the development of innovative Multi-INT information fusion algorithms to support BDA<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Investigate and recommend a Cognitive Workflow Process for the production of BDA products <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Automated restrike recommendations based on unsuccessful targeting effects</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates overall scientific and technical merit for the development and/or enhancement of the technology; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness; and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIED will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the offeror believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information; a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and&nbsp;have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p><br />VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:<br />Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:<br />Patrick K. McCabe<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3197 <br />Email: <a href="mailto:patrick.mccabe.4@us.af.mil">patrick.mccabe.4@us.af.mil</a></p>

<p>The BOP intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price service contract with a five year base period and five one-year option periods.&nbsp; The offeror will be required to house a daily population of not more than 100% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The institution shall include a Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a minimum capacity of 100 beds. An additional five (5) SHU beds will be required for every 100 inmates over 2,000.

Services received from or provided to the resulting contract shall not be shared with other non-DOJ contractual obligations.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.</p>
<p>Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is proposed.

An offeror's proposal must in the sole opinion of the Bureau of Prisons, contain sufficient information for the Bureau to conduct a complete analysis.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith-based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP. <br /><br />The solicitation will be available on or after 1/22/2015, with an anticipated closing date for receipt of proposals on 3/09/2015.

Title: Market Survey for ISO Registration Services for Aviation Safety (AVS)

Name:  Andrea Roman, Contract Specialist

Organization: AAQ-420

Region: HQ - FAA Headquarters (Washington, DC)

Phone Number: 202-267-4691

E-Mail: andrea.roman@faa.gov

Date: 12/29/14

Phase: Commercial/Simplified

Procurement Method: Market Survey

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Line of Business has a requirement for ISO 9001:2008 registrar support services. Aerospace and transportation industry changes necessitate that the FAAs Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) that will enable the total organization to continually manage change that effectively improves safety oversight of the United States (U.S.) National Aerospace System (NAS).  The AVS organization is also deeply involved in the Agencies implementation of a Safety Management System (SMS) and the Next-Generation (NEXTGEN) air traffic control systems. The AVS organization is composed of over 7,000 people geographically distributed to over 150 locations that execute system, business and technical processes. Having completed two (2) three-year cycles of registration and surveillance audits, AVS must now complete another recertification audit and surveillance audits to sustain the certificate.  In order to accomplish this goal, AVS requires the services of a qualified contractor to perform the required recertification audit and the subsequent surveillance audits. The current contractor is ABS Quality Evaluation Inc., 16855 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77060 under Contract No. DTFAWA-12-C-00031, which ends 03/31/2015.

The purpose of this survey is to gather information in order to determine whether there is adequate competition among small businesses and to choose the procurement method for this requirement.  If adequate competition is determined to exist among small businesses then the FAA may determine to set aside the requirement for competition among small businesses, if this cannot be determined based on the response to this market survey then the requirement will be open to all business sizes.  The current contract (DTFAWA-12-C-00031) expires on 3/31/2015 and we have no plans to extend. Ninety percent of the ceiling amount on the contract has been awarded. The ceiling amount for the existing contract is $112,700.00.  

All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Andrea Roman, at andrea.roman@faa.gov. No phone calls will be accepted. Please see the attached market survey announcement and statement of work for more details. Responses are due by 10am, EST, February 5, 2015 to andrea.roman@faa.gov.

<DESC>**This announcement provides Amendment 000003 to Screening Information Request (SIR) / Request for Offer (RFO) DTFAWA-15-R-00006.  Amendment 000003 revises the date by which the FAA will post responses to offeror questions from 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday, January 26, 2015 to as soon as possible in accordance with the revised Section L.3.2.1 that is being provided with this amendment.  In addition, Amendment 000003 revises the proposal submission due date from 2:00 pm EST on Friday, February 6, 2015 to no later than a time and date to be determined and posted in an amendment to this SIR/RFO on the FAA Contract Opportunities website at https://faaco.faa.gov/ in accordance with the revised Section L.3.2.3 that is being provided with this amendment.**

**This announcement provides Amendment 000002 to Screening Information Request (SIR) / Request for Offer (RFO)DTFAWA-15-R-00006.  Amendment 000002 revises the date by which the FAA will post responses to offor questions from 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday, January 19, 2015 to 5:00 pm, EST on Monday, January 26, 2015 in accordance with the revised Section L.3.2.1 that is being provided with this amendment. In addition, this amendment revises the proposal submission due date from 2:00 p.m. EST on Friday, January 23, 2015 to 2:00 pm EST on Friday, February 6, 2015 in accordance with the revised Section L3.2.3 that is being provided with this amendment.**

**This announcement corrects the previous posting of Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) DTFAWA-15-R-00006 Amendment 000001.  The previous posting neglected to provide an amended Section A.  This announcement provides Amendment 00001 to Section A.  In addition, the previous posting of Amendment 000001 provided an Attachment J.4 that was incorrectly named Section J Att J.4 Amendment 00001.  The correct abbreviated name for this document is Section J Att J.4 Amendment 000001.  Because this correction only adds a fifth zero in the amendment number in the name for Attachment J.4 but does not change the document itself, a revised Attachment J.4 is not being provided at this time.**

**Amendment 000001 removes the previously posted Section J Attachment J.4 ARTCC CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL POWER SYSTEM SITE LIST MicroSoft (MS) Word document and replaces it with Section J Attachment J.4 Amendment 000001 in as an MS Excel document.  The amended J.4 attachment provides mailing addresses for all twenty-five (25) of the ACEPS facilities that were previously listed on the original Attachment J.4.  NOTE:  Offerors are NOT to contact these facilities in any manner  the addresses are being provided for proposal preparation only**  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the replacement of battery systems at 25 Air Route Traffic Control Center Critical/Essential Power System (ACEPS) facilities (21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), 3 large Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACONs) and 1 ACEPS training facility).  Certain facilities are supported by Valve Regulated Acid (VRLA) battery strings while other facilities are supported by Valve Lead Acid (VLA) units.  

The contractor must perform battery site visits and attend pre-installation meetings, supply and deliver the battery strings and individual batteries, remove and dispose of existing battery strings and individual batteries, install new battery strings and individual batteries, reinstall the existing battery monitoring systems and test the replacement battery strings and individual batteries with the Uninterruptible Power Module (UPM). The sequence of sites where battery strings and individual batteries must be replaced will be determined by the Government.

This Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO) requires Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products that meet the specifications in Section C.

This is a Small Business set-aside.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this effort is 335911 Storage Battery Manufacturing with the size standard of 500 employees.

The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP/IDIQ) with a period of performance of a two-year base period and six one-year option periods.  The base period is anticipated to begin April 1, 2015.

Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C.

<CONTACT>Perry, Jerry
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Conservation Training Center (NCTC) in Shepherdstown, WV intends to solicit for landscape maintenance and snow removal services for the facility.  The NCTC is an active training facility located on 532 acres fronting the Potomac River.  The facility consists of 18 buildings with approximately 450,000 square feet.  The campus is divided into an instructional area, a recreation area, a maintenance and utility support area, in addition to four guest lodges, accessed by 3.16 miles of paved public roadways, .66 miles of maintenance gravel roads, 30,284 SQYD of paved parking lots and loading dock areas, 2.94 miles of paved foot paths, 4.37 miles of non-paved walking trails, and a 300 foot wooden plank surface pedestrian bridge.  NCTC is a vigilant environmental conservation center, ensuring the sustainability of the site and protecting the surrounding flora and fauna.  All contractor equipment used and land management practices should reflect positive results under the LEED: Existing Buildings Operation and Maintenance thresholds, such as efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce heat island effects, eliminate light pollution, reduce noise pollution, and manage storm water runoff.  The NCTC land management plan strives for a native appearance rather than one that is impeccably groomed and overly prescripted, thus enhancing the natural functions of the site and its surrounding ecology.  
PROJECT SCOPE:  Sustainability management involves using low-impact landscape management, removal of snow and ice, cleaning sidewalks, managing pests, and maintaining the grounds.  Sustainable landscape maintenance involves using or restoring native and adapted plants, which require less maintenance, less irrigation, limited plant watering, and fewer or no applications of chemical fertilizer or pesticides.  The landscape maintenance services work includes mowing operations, edging, trimming, weeding and mulching, planting bed maintenance, removal of debris, repair of damaged turf, trees and shrubs, tree removal, pruning and maintenance, sign cleaning, roadway and trail maintenance, and land management maintenance.  Snow and ice removal services work includes anti-slip treatment of the NCTC campus roadways, parking lots , loading docks, paved and concrete sidewalks, patios, building entrances, stairways, and foot bridges.  Special care must be utilized in clearing the Commons and Quad areas where there is Decorative Pavement (stamped asphalt).  Information on a site visit and instructions to obtain access to the site will be provided in the solicitation.  It is anticipated that a single organized site visit will be conducted approximately one week after the release of the solicitation.
PROPOSAL PERIOD:  The request for proposals is scheduled for release on or about 05 January, 2015.  The proposals will be due on or about 04 February 2015.  The anticipated award is 16 March 2015. 
PROPOSAL PROCEDURES:  The acquisition will be issued as a Small Business Set-Aside, Request for Proposals, through FedBizOpps.  The solicitation will be for a base year and include four option years for a total of five years.  The magnitude of this project is estimated to be between $250,000.00 and $340,000.00 per year.  This acquisition will result in a single fixed price contract. Award shall be made to the responsible contractor, whose proposal, conforming to the request for proposal, will be most advantageous to the Government.  Evaluation criteria will be specified in the request for proposal, which will include, as attachments, a Statement of Work and other supporting documents.
This is an electronically issued acquisition.  The Government will issue the request for proposal via FedBizOpps.  Proposals will be received in hard/paper copies only.  Electronic and fax proposals will not be accepted.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by this agency.

<p>16. Description: <br />**Updated 22 January 2015: RFP has been posted**<br /><br />This solicitation is for one self-sustaining, U.S. flagged vessel, capable of maintaining an average speed of sixteen (16) knots and minimum operating range of 13,000 nautical miles (nm). The vessel shall have a minimum capacity of 2,350 TEUs and provide climate control for a minimum of 1,350 TEU ammunition laden containers.</p>
<p>Attached is a Draft RFP Section C providing part of the main technical portion of the RFP that will be forthcoming. Interested offerors are strongly encouraged to review the Draft RFP Section C now since the RFP will only be open for thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>Duration of the contract period: One 5 month base period with four 1-year option periods and one 6-month option period.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>17. Place of Contract Performance: Worldwide</p>
<p>18. Set-aside Status: This procurement will be competed as a tiered small business set-aside. If the government receives offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery; no offers received from other than small business concerns will be considered for award. If the Government does not receive offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery; all offers, including offers from other than small business concerns, will be considered for award.</p>
<p>19. Rationale for Small Business Strategy (as required by ASN(RDA) Memorandum, Improving Communications During the Market Research Process, dated 2 June 2014): The Contracting Officer could not make a conclusive determination, in an effort to promote small business participation, whether at least two or more offers would be received from small business concerns meeting the solicitation requirements at fair market prices. She determined that the use of a tiered or cascading evaluation of offers would be appropriate in accordance with DFARS 215.203-70 based on results of competition under RFP N00033-14-R-3201. MSC's Small Business Associate Director concurs with the determination of a tiered small business set-aside.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY UPDATE (01/22/2015)<br /></span></strong>Due to current and projected future Out of Reporting (OOR) aircraft rates, the USN strategy for F/A-18 A-A/B/C/D Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) has been revised. As the fleet continues to experience an increase in F/A-18A/B/C/D OOR, additional contractor DLM capacity is required. Accordingly, the USN intends to pursue a dual private source approach by continuing to use the current OEM vendor, The Boeing Company, Jacksonville FL, and establishing an alternative source pursuant to the authority at FAR 6.202 and DFARS 206.2, which would exclude The Boeing Company.
<p>The proposed competitive contract will include a base year plus two option years with an anticipated award in FY16. This contract will provide the alternative source the opportunity to demonstrate its capability to perform the F/A-18A/B/C/D DLM requirements, after which a multiple award contract will be pursued to allow both sources (OEM and alternative source) to compete for the required DLM.</p>
<p>In preparation for establishing an alternative source, PMA265 is acquiring the additional GFE to be provided to the alternative source.</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to release a draft RFP for this competitive procurement on or about 27 February 2015. Interested parties should check this site for future updates.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">The United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&amp;C) issues this initial RFI, in a planned series of RFIs, to collect information for planning purposes only regarding the concept of an Enterprise Automated Security Environment (EASE).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EASE is a concept; it is not an entity, system, or program. The EASE concept envisions an environment in which automated and dynamic enterprise-level cyberspace<sup>1</sup> defense capabilities&mdash;such as adaptive sensing, sense-making, decision-making, and acting&mdash;provide shared situational awareness and support response in cyber-relevant time<sup>2 </sup>.&nbsp; EASE itself is not a capability, but the concept aims to enable the government to improve its own cyberspace defense capabilities, benefiting from the enhanced interoperability and automation that EASE should create. In addition, other enterprises may voluntarily leverage this concept to augment their own cyberspace defense capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Making the EASE concept a reality will require the concerted, collaborative efforts of government, private sector, industry, academia, and other stakeholders, such as critical infrastructure<sup>3</sup> and key resources (CIKR) end users. This RFI represents just the first step in this direction.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - West Point has awarded a contract for the design and development of an emerging biometric authentication system based on non-traditional modalities incorporated in existing Active Authentication research. This includes research and development of a Biometrics Application Program Interface (API) consisting of: (1) A secure container for behavioral/cognitive-based and traditional biometric sensors and analysis engine applications; (2) sensor data fusion algorithms to support a multi-modality Active Authentication platform; (3) cryptographic algorithms and protocols using biometrics features to support the ability to transmit and receive data security using a key exchange that is client-verified; and (4) data collection support for specific biometric sensor that are part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Desktop and Mobile Active Authentication Program. Additionally, this effort will include technical subject matter expertise support for emerging behavioral based biometric capabilities and platforms. It is anticipated that the period of performance will include a base period from date of award through 31 July 2015 and an option period from 1 August 2015 through 30 June 2016.  <br>

<DESC>This requirement is for PCAS for the Air Traffic Control Tower at MCAF, building 2105, construction contract N40080-12-D-0409-0019.  The contractor for the design of this contract is Clark Nexsen. A sole source justification has been completed stating, Clark Nexsen is the designer of record (DOR) for the construction documents, and the PCAS represents a follow on contract for the continued effort to provide the requested HVAC, Architectural, and Electrical work. A Dynamic Small Business Search was completed to conduct market research, however no other design firm can achieve the level of familiarity held by Clark Nexsen for this set of construction documents.  Substantial duplication of effort will be necessary for another design firm to review the construction documents and provide any insight as to the intent of the original DOR.

Purchase Request Number 674-15-2-5065-0888.
      
2.  Nature and/or Description of Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open competition.  The proposed action is for emergency eepair amd replacement of water line break in the area behind and to the east of the Research Building, Chapel to include the CLC, Domiciliary, and Buildings 147, 146, 53, 47, 45 and 44 plus the IT Building 222 and the Safety Building 202 at the Temple VA Medical Center.  This service is required to make emergency repairs and replace approximately 800 feel of 6 inch ductal iron water pipe with two fire hydrants.  Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to CPS Utilities, LLC (DBA: Corenerstone Plumbing), 324 S. 8th St., Waco, TX 76701.   

3.  Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Engineering Department at the Temple VA Medical Center has a request for emergency eepair amd replacement of water line break in the area behind and to the east of the Research Building, Chapel to include the CLC, Domiciliary, and Buildings 147, 146, 53, 47, 45 and 44 plus the IT Building 222 and the Safety Building 202 at the Temple VA Medical Center.  On January 13, 2015 the Director of Central Texas Health Care System, Ms. Sallie Houser-Hanfelder sent out a Boradcast message notifying employees of the Water Line Breat at the Temple Campus.  Employees were notified that the valves had been shut off to the aforementioned buildings and notified that this may impact the affected areas with lowe water pressure.  The message further stated that the water is only to be used for flushing toilets, and employees must use hand sanitizers and bottled water for all other critical needs.  As a result of the water line break the surgrys scheduled to be performed at the Temple Campus on January 13th - the date the water line is repaired had to be cancelled.   On January 13, 2015 after normal business hours the Engineering Department contacted Contracting to request authorization to proceed with an Emergency procurement to repair and replace these water lines.  Authorization was granted on January 13, 2015 and the Contract was executed on January 14, 2015 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Unusal and Compelling Urgency. The period of performance was 01/14/2015 - 02/13/2015.  The total estimated value of the proposed action is $140,000.00   
                        
4.  Statutory Authority Premitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302.1  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Ensuring efficient and ongoing operations at the VA Medical Campus Temple is primary in requesting this emergency contract.  CPS Utilities, LLC.,  has the required technicians, and replacement parts necessary for this contract.  Delay in award of a contract will result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government, because the VA had to cancel scheduled surgreies and if the water break is not fixed in a timely manner it could eventually impact other areas of the hospital.   

6.  Description of Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Due to the urgency of this requirement, a synopsis was not posted to FedBizOpps.gov.  FAR 5.202 (a) (2) allows exceptions to the requirement of publicizing proposed contract actions due to unusual and compelling urgency circumstances.   

7.   Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2) the Contracting Officer shall determine pricing fair and reasonable based on a comparison to the Independent Government estimate.  The requirements of FAR 15.406-2, Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data are not applicable to this acquisition.  

8.  Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The services are commercial and sold within the market.  Market research was conducted by the using service to determine which contractor was best suited to meet the agency's needs.  CPS Utilities, LLC has the required technicians and the necessary replacement parts required to complete this requirement.   Due to the emergency nature of this requirement, the service is only available via the open market.  

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:   Not Applicable.   

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  There are no other sources but the proposed.

11.  A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be competed.
