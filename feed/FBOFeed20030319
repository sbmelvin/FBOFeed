<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation of offers to operate commercial services in Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area in Tennessee. The operation will include Rustic overnight lodging, dining room food and beverage, general souvenir sales and Horseback Stable service.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $121,042 - 129,000 annually. The term of this contract is expected to be six years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of 5% of gross revenue per year. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51 has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are expected to be less than $50,000 in the first year of the contract. The current concessionaire has been determined to have been a 'satisfactory' operator. The current concessionaire is considered not to be a 'preferred offeror' which basically means that they do not have to right to match the terms of any better offer. Offers must be received by 4:00 p.m. May 20, 2003. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).    There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service. Include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number. All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303. No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored. Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (The Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) intends increase the maximum quantity of BA-5347/U batteries that can be ordered under Firm-Fixed-Priced Contract Number DAAB07-98-D-R311 with Mathews Associates, Inc. (MAI) of Sanford, Florida, from  75,000 to 225,000.  This is a restricted acquisition under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  MAI is the only source that has designed and produced this battery in accordance with the Government's safety and performance requirements.  Any other source's product would need to undergo required safety and First Article Testing that would result in delivery delays of approximately one year from contract award.  The Government has initiated a follow-on multiple-awa rd, competitive acquisition (NextGen II, Phase IV), and projects contract awards for the BA-5347/U, or its replacement, in September 2003, with deliveries anticipated to commence in September 2004.  This battery is the only non-rechargeable power source fo r use in the Thermal Weapons Site (TWS).  The TWS is undergoing widespread fielding during a military build-up, and is being utilized by forces supporting Operation Enduring Freedom, resulting in increased requirements for the BA-5347/U battery.  Due to th e critical end item application of this battery for the TWS, the Government requires a steady supply of this battery  in order to meet mission requirements until deliveries commence under the NextGen II, Phase IV.  THIS IS SOLELY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES .

Up to four indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with a total contract period not to exceed three years.  The contracts may consist of a base period not to exceed one year, with a maximum of two one-year option periods.   Alternatively, the contracts may consist of one three-year contract period.  The total amount of work will not exceed $3,000,000 per contract.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. The contracts may include task orders with opt ions for engineering and design, checking of shop drawings and design during construction.  Award of the first contract is anticipated in fourth quarter, FY03.  The method used to allocate task orders among contracts will include consideration of experienc e and user needs, capacity to accomplish the order in the required timeframe, performance and quality of deliverables, and proximity of the firm to the project.  Funds are not presently available for the contracts.   This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  A separate announcement will be issued specifically set-aside for small businesses (to include 8A and HUBZone firms).  If a large business is selected for these contracts, it must comply with  FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for the Kansas City District are:  (1) at least 57.2% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed wi th small businesses (SB), including small disadvantaged businesses (SDB) and women-owned small businesses (WOSB); (2) at least 8.9% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with SDB; (3) at least 8.1% of a contractor's intended subcontract a mount be placed with WOSB; (4) at least 3% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small business concerns owned and controlled by service disabled veterans and (4) 3% placed with HUBZone small businesses.  The plan is not required wit h this submittal.  The small business standard for this effort is based on the average annual receipts of the concern and its affiliates for the preceding three (3) fiscal years.  A business is small for this effort if its average annual receipts do not ex ceed $4 million.

<CONTACT>Rebecca Vaughn, 256-895-1395
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama in support of the U.S. Military Academy (USMA), NY, intends to privatize its electric distribution system.  This privatization does not include the electric commodity and does not supplant e xisting commodity contracts.  Privatization is the transfer of ownership, which includes operation & maintenance, repair, improvements, etc. of Army owned systems to a non-Federal entity, and the subsequent acquisition of the utility distribution services from the new owners of the systems.  The Government will retain liability of any pre-existing environmental conditional conditions.  The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under10 U.S.C. 2688.  The conveyance will tr ansfer all rights, title, and interest of the United States Government in and to the utility distribution system.  The conveyance will not include any real property.  The contract for the acquisition of utility distribution services will be for a term of 5 0 years.    USMA’s electric distribution system is a modern, well-maintained system. Due to the large number of cadets and support staff, upgrades are frequently completed to maintain and meet state of the art education.  The local utility company enters the property at 2 locations with 35,000 volts and is then transformed to 13,800 volts and 4,160 volts. The transformation is accomplished by one (1) regulator station, four (4) primary substations, more than three dozen secondary substations and numerous transformers t hat deliver the power to the final user.  There are over 547,339 linear feet of underground primary cable and 150,660 linear feet of underground secondary cable.  These cables reach their destination through 439 manholes and 410,475 linear feet of mostly c oncrete encased duct.  There are 148,818 linear feet of overhead primary cable and 37,986 linear feet of overhead secondary cable.  The overhead has more than 303 utility poles with associated hardware.  There are over 1,099 street light standards and pole s that are a combination of a series of street lighting and multiple volt lighting with over 581,700 linear feet of underground overhead cable.  Many of the street light poles are specially cast structures.  Transformers number more than 200 and all oil fi lled transformers are tested every three years for PCB’s and other contaminants.  Preventive maintenance is performed regularly on all primary and secondary switching and all 100+ substation relays are tested yearly.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The RFP will be available during the March 2002 timeframe electronically through the Internet at www.hnd.usace.army.mil/contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), maintains ship stowage facilities for obsolete ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NRDF) at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), in Fort Eustis, VA; the Suisan Bay Reserve Fleet (SBRF), north of San Francisco, CA; and at the Beaumont Reserve Fleet in Beaumont, TX.  These ships have become obsolete, many are in a dilapidated, unsafe condition, and to some degree all contain various quantities of fuels, oils, asbestos, PCBs, lead paint, and other hazardous materials and hazardous wastes.  It is the intent of MARAD to issue at least one, and possibly more, Two-Step Invitation for Bids within 2003 for the complete dismantling and the hazardous materials/hazardous waste (HM/HW) removal and remediation/disposal for various ships in the NDRF.  The exact ships will be identified in each Two-Step IFB at the time of release.  These IFBs will be limited to domestic ship disposal proposals due to the poor condition of the ships chosen for disposal under them and their inability to be towed outside of the United States.  Depending upon the bids received, each ship may be awarded separately, or multiple awards may be made involving any combination of the ships, or alternatively, only one award may be made for all the ships included in any one IFB.  It is the Government’s intent to contract for the dismantling portion of the work on a firm fixed price basis, with the HM/HW remediation and disposal performed on a cost basis based upon actual, verifiable quantities of material/waste removed.  It is expected that the first IFB for this effort will be posted on the FedBizOps website in April 2003.  All IFBs issued will be subject to the availability of funding.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-12.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure services of a Biologist from Henry M. Jackson Foundation, 1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 600, Rockville, MD  20852.  The contractor should have extensive expertise in state-of-the-art Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, as well as complete familiarity with the relevant molecular biology and biochemical techniques to structural biology.  The specific tasks are as follows and will be included in the Request for Quote (RFQ).  The service will be for a Base Year with four (4) option years.  

The contractor shall provide personnel resources for research and development for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) within the National Institutes of Health.  The activities to be conducted under these categories concern the application of multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to the determination of three-dimensional structures of proteins and protein compexes.  A fundamental knowledge and understanding of state-of-the-art multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, of the application of this method to three-dimensional structure determination of larger proteins, of methods of protein expression, purification and mutagenesis, and of computational methods required to convert the experimental data into three-dimensional atomic structures, are key factors in accomplishing the tasks.  Specifically the contractor must provide key personnel with a PhD degree that involved extensive use of macromolecular NMR spectroscopy and its application to 3D structure determination, in conjunction with molecular biology techniques.

  Task Area 1. Protein NMR Section, NIDDK

	Task 1.  The Contractor shall provide support for the 3D structure determination of proteins using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and associated computational techniques with special emphasis on complexes of the bacterial phosphotransferase (PTS) pathway.  The task requires familiarity with NMR spectroscopy, biochemistry/molecular biology, and computer environments.  The effort shall initially focus on the 60 kDA dimeric complexes of IIAmannose with HPr and IIBmannose , and will subsequently be extended to the 90 kDA trimeric complex of IIAlactose and HPr.  The effort involves extensive interaction with personnel in the Protein NMR Section.  Initial work will focus on expressing and purifying appropriate quantities of isotopically labeled (15N, 13C and/or 2H) proteins.  This will be followed by the application of multidimensional separated and isotopically-filtered NMR experiments to derive (a) sequential backbone and sidechain assignments of the protein components within the complexes; (b) derivation of structural information in the form of interproton distances obtained from multidimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement measurements, long range  restraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements, and orientational restraints from measurements in oriented samples in dilute liquid crystalline media; and (c) finally calculation of 3D structures from the experimental NMR data using computational algorithms involving the application of simulated annealing methodologies (and in particular torsion angle and conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics).  

NIDDK has determined that based upon their experience and expertise, The Foundation is the only source with the unique qualifications that can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.

<DESC>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has a need for consulting services related to its financial management systems.  The consultant will serve as Financial Management?s functional resource and work in coordination with Information Resources Management on technical changes affecting the legacy business financial system interfacing with the core financial system, ensuring compliance with financial management requirements.  As a government corporation subject to the Credit Reform Act of 1990, OPIC has unique accounting and budget needs.  The Corporation must keep three sets of books to accommodate the accounting requirements of the federal budget, of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), and of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  OPIC uses version 11i of Oracle Government Financials (OGF), with product extensions to handle federal government accounting and budget requirements, as its core financial system.  OGF links to the legacy business financial systems via an interface program that runs daily.  The legacy system has been moved to an APPX-based platform.  As part of the on-going interface process which ranges from recording entries in the legacy system to generating financial reports from the system of record, OPIC seeks consulting services to perform the following:  1) Assess the impact of the APPX-based platform on the daily interface process, as follows:  Assess ways to eliminate the complexity of transactions processed through the daily interface.
Advise on ways to prevent data entry errors at the source.  Review APPX functionality to suggest enhancements to simplify the daily processing of transactions.  Review the current method of processing daily transactions through the interface scripts to determine if script changes will improve efficiency of the process.  Devise ways to minimize the amount of follow up review required to ensure proper translation of transactions into OGF.  Assess and recommend changes to mapping tables, programs and other aspects of the daily conversion process as required.  Provide documentation for the various process flows, procedural changes and efficient reconciliations.  2)  Ensure that interface processes allow for timely and correct recording and reporting of data for internal and external users, as follows:  Recommend ways to improve the various reconciliation processes needed to ensure efficient, timely, and accurate processing of all financial transactions.   Assess the impact of internal policy and procedural changes on the processing of financial information and subsequent reporting requirements.  Assess the impact of Credit Reform regulations and recommend changes to the processing to ensure proper classification of credit reform transactions and interact with OMB to ensure compliance with reporting requirements.  Evaluate the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on financial management and ensure that the changes are reflected in the recording, processing, and reporting of financial information.  Design and develop parameters for reports for internal and external purposes that efficiently access financial data from both the legacy and the core financial systems.  As a result of the preceding assessments and evaluations, provide written recommendations and examples that can be used to implement those recommendations. The most successful candidate will have extensive technical and functional experience with Oracle Government Financials in a federal government entity (preferably a U.S. Government corporation) subject to GAAP, FASAB, budgetary, and federal credit reform regulations and reporting requirements.
The government contemplates a one (1) man-year effort .  The Period of Performance for the base year will be July 3, 2002 to July 4, 2003 with five one-year options. 

Submit resumes by June 28, 2002 by 5:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation , ATTN:  Valerie Settles, 1100 New York Avenue, N. W., Room 11170 Washington, D. C.  20527.  No collect telephone calls will be accepted.

The total performance period for the contract will be six (6) weeks.  This requirement will be set-aside for small business under NAICS 234990 with a $28.5 million size standard.

<DESC>The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is soliciting interest from manufacturers of prime movers and drive trains for the electrical utility industry to assist in developing a novel variable speed drive system suitable for very high horsepower/very high torque electrical power generator applications.  A bench scale model demonstrated that the proposed design is simple, scalable, low cost, and potentially very efficient.  The purpose of the joint collaboration would be to develop, test and evaluate a small-scale version in a 250KW system.  With successful demonstration, a pilot scale application is proposed.  The technology in its most basic form is limited to small speed changes that yield a 40% change, but a more evolved design can achieve up to a 100% speed change in a single stage.  Application is ideally suited to infinitely fine tune driver speeds while maintaining synchronous generator speeds in turbine driven systems, such as steam, wind, gas and water, and in systems with piston engine drivers.  Knowledge and experience in working with prime mover, drive trains, and utility power plants would be beneficial.  If the development project is successful, the technology would be available for license to the party or parties providing funding and in-kind support.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The U.S Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), currently berths the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) vessel ?ex-Albert E. Watts? in a heavy weather moored condition at Little Sand Island, Mobile Bay, Alabama.  This 4,551 long ton tanker was built in 1941, and has become obsolete.  It is not operational, is extremely deteriorated, and contains unknown quantities of fuels, oils, asbestos, PCBs, lead paint, and other hazardous materials and wastes. It is MARAD?s intention to issue a Two Step Invitation to Bid (IFB) within the next month for the complete dismantling and hazardous materials/hazardous waste (HM/HW) remediation and disposal of this vessel. The Government intends to contract for the dismantling portion of the work on a firm fixed price basis, with the HM/HW remediation/disposal performed on a cost basis based on actual, verifiable quantities of materials and wastes found on the vessel during the remediation and disposal process.  It is expected that the IFB for this effort will be issued on the FedBizOps website in February of 2003.  The IFB will be issued subject to the availability of funding.

Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items (July 2002), DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items (Nov 1995), and DFARS 252.225-7000, Buy American Act-Balance Payment Program Certificate (Sep 1999) with the quotation.  Clauses and provisions may be accessed via the Internet, http://farsite. hill.af.mil or www.arnet.far.gov.  The following clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference and are to remain in full force in any resultant purchase order.  FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (Oct 2000) applies to this acquisition.  The following paragraphs of this clause are addended as follows: (b)(4) Offeror shall include one (1) product sample of a textbook, student textbooks, and instructor materials written and published by the offeror in sufficient detail to evaluate offeror’s technical capability to satisfy this requirement and (b)(10) Offer shall include at least two (2) references for it’s most recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items, including contract number and point of contact, including telephone number. Submit signed and dated quotations with company name, address, phone number, email address and point of contact.  Basis for award:  This is a competitive best value source selection.  Technical factors (adherence to SOW, sample, and delivery within 4-5 months after receipt of order (ARO) or earlier.) will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Past and present performance will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to price.  An offeror’s proposed prices will be determined by adding the quantities identified in CLINs 0001 and 0002 to confirm the extended amount of each CLIN.  CLINs 0001 and 0002 will be totaled to determine the overall price to be evaluated. The contracting officer shall seek performance information on the technically acceptable offerors based on the references provided by the offerors and data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offer’s ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating of the following:  
Exceptional/High Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Very Good/Significant Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
Satisfactory/Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Neutral/Unknown Confidence:  No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). 
Marginal/Little Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements.
Unsatisfactory/No Confidence:  Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
The evaluation will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  Offerors with no relevant past performance information shall receive the rating of “NEUTRAL” meaning the rating is treated neither favorable nor unfavorable. If the lowest price evaluated technically acceptable offer is judged to have an exceptional confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. The Government reserves the right to award a purchase order to other than the lowest evaluated price.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information as specified in this RFQ.    Offers may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information (PPI) to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse PPI is considered to be information resulting in an overall risk rating of unsatisfactory or marginal.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserve the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  The contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Award will be made to a single source.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2002) is incorporated into this RFP and is addended to add the following clause: 52.204-4, Printed or Copied Double-sided on Recycled Paper.  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order-Commercial (May 2002) is applicable.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS POSTING IS A MODIFICATION TO THE ORIGINAL POSTING. THE NEW, MODIFIED SYNOPSIS REFLECTS THE CORRECT  DUE DATE OF OFFERS (03/21/03).  THE SYNOPSIS POSTED 3/14/03 WAS POSTED ONLY TO THE LOCAL HANSCOM ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this synopsis/solicitation is 541511 (Size Standard - $21 Million).  Solicitation/Purchase Request number FUGPL930520100 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12, effective 24 January 2003.  The Government intends to solicit and award to ThermoAnalytics, Inc., of Calumet, Michigan, on a sole source basis.  One (1) contract line item for the addition of features to the ThermoAnalytics, Inc. Multi-Service Electro Optic Signature (MuSES) software suite, the Thermal Description File Input/Output Library (TDF I/O), and the MuSES Lite in support of the suite for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Weather Impact Decision Aids (WIDA) currently in development and operation.  These supplies and services have the following description. STATEMENT OF WORK: AFRL/VSBL requires that software features be added to ThermoAnalytics thermal/signature-solver software named MuSES.  TASKS: The following tasks will add features to MuSES, TDF I/O Library, and MuSES Lite to support the suite of AFRL/VSBL Weather Impact Decision Aids (WIDA) currently in development and operation.  TASK 1: Add a Patch Solver capability to MuSES to provide a Rapid Calculation Mode in WIDA software products such as Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS), Joint Environmental Exploration Segment (JEES), or Infrared Target Scene Simulation Software (IRTSS). This task will be accomplished through the following steps: (1) Eliminate lateral conduction (use existing patch generator so elements in the same patch have the same temperature).  (2) Add patch level access functions to the TDF I/O library.  (3) Deactivate calculation of extra node temperatures in each radiation patch so only one temperature is calculated for each patch. (4) Pre-compute apparent areas and store in a file for use in the thermal solution and when retrieving results with the TDF I/O library.  (5) Code Testing and Verification, Target Upgrades, TAWS Integration Support.  TASK 2: Provide Requested Software Revisions to MuSES Lite.  Initial target editing capability (re-scaling and re-painting) is included in MuSES Lite and associated function calls in the TDF I/O Library. The software was based on anticipated user requirements. As it is further exposed to the User Community, feedback is being generated resulting in new requirements and requested design changes to the Graphical User Interface. Additional changes are being requested for the associated Paint Databases for each target type.  TASK 3: The Contractor will modify three (3) MuSES IR target models for use in TAWS V3.1.2. Supporting documentation will be provided along with the target files. Support for testing and implementation and TAWS is required. The targets should have optimal runtime speed within TAWS. The targets will use unclassified input data and will be delivered through unclassified channels. The specified target models include the Roland II tank, the AAA Gun (KS-19, 100-mm), and the AAA Gun (S-60, 57-mm). The target files and support documentation will be delivered to the TAWS system integrator, NGIT, and to AFRL/VSBL.  DELIVERABLES/SCHEDULE: Deliverables will include all software product updates (including MuSES Pro, MuSES Lite, TDF I/O Library), target models, paint databases, briefing materials, and documentation developed under this contract per AFRL/VSBL specifications. The exact delivery date of each item will be coordinated with AFRL/VSBL. The period of performance is from contract award date through Sep 30, 2003.

DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS
This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided
under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA
requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building
information per the solicitation.
REASONABLE CARE:
1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon
determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.
Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or
with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as
architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair
contractors and equipment service contractors.
NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that
the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.
Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:
Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid
identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each
dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:
(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local
jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone
number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act
for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s
license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases
where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and
testified to by the submitter; and
(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or
certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun &
Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and
(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,
(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.
Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s)
picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU
documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time
of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.
2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of
the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal
purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized
use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after
completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding
hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and
removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract
and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record
copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded
against unauthorized use for the term of retention.
4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall
provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents,
with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.
Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals
process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from
computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents
and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable
and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building
information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>This modification is issued to respond to questions received, revise the specifications to incorporate a 10MHz rubidium clock and revise the Response date to 18 April 2003.


 Question 1.  The specifications at (3) stipulate the unit must operate of 110/22 VAC, which I assume is a typographical error for 110/220 VAC.  I note that detailed specification (h) refers to 110/220 VAC.  Please confirm.
 Answer.	Question 1. Should be corrected to read 120/220 Volts A.C.

Question 2.   The 10 MHz crystal oscillator is described as being output through an SMA type connector on the front or rear panel.  Please confirm whether an SMA connector is required, as our quotation Q02-1528-A specified a BNC type
Connector?
Answer.	Question 2, which defines the 10 MHz output should state that either an SMA or BNC connector could be utilized.

(3) Incorporate a 10 MHz rubidium clock, utilized to maintain long-term frequency accuracy. This atomic clock shall be phased locked to both 10.24 GHz and 10 MHz crystal reference.
Both the Ultra Low Noise 10 MHz Crystal Oscillator and 10 MHz Rubidium clock are locked together and used to lock to the 10.240 GHz microwave reference.  This phase lock is used to provide the means to phase lock an ultra low noise, highly stable reference for use with other coherent high stability RF systems.  A 10 MHz sine wave signal, (generated by distributing the locked ultra low noise crystal reference and Rubidium clock signals) shall be output through either a SMA or BNC type connector located on either the front or rear panel of the unit.  This signal shall have output power levels in the range of: + 7 to. +10 dBm.  The atomic clock shall have the following performance: a) Reference frequency 10.000 MHz; b) factory set accuracy, +/- 1 x 10^(-10), c) Aging, approximately 5 X 10^(-11)/month and 5 x 10^(-10) per year; d) Temperature Stability approximately 5 x 10^(-11)/degree C; e) Retrace +/- 5 x 10^(-11) (72 hours off, then 72 hours on).
The response date is extended to 18 April 2003.

<DESC>The following are questions and answers for NAMA-03-Q-0008, 
Events Planner.

*** THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ANSWERED PRIOR TO AWARD OF THIS SOLICITATION.***

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL COMBINED SYNOPSIS?SOLICITAION.  THE CLOSING DATE REMAINS UNCHANGED

1. Will you accept the proposal by Email?
     
Answer: Yes, we will accept proposals by email.  However, please contact Santo Plater by phone after you send your proposal to ensure that she has received it.

2. Should we figure Other Direct Costs, ie sound, lighting, staging, security, transportation, etc into the proposal?  

Answer: It is not necessary to include other direct costs.  As the Events Planner, you will be responsible for making contact with the responsible agencies that will provide these requirements such as security, transportation etc.  In the event it can?t be provided for through local and Gov?t agencies, the Events Planner will be then do market research and provide three sources to NARA who in turn will contract out for these services.

3. Is there an incumbent events planner contractor with NARA who will be considered for this project? 

Answer: The Foundation for the National Archives, a public/private partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration, has contracted with an events planner to oversee the Foundation-related events surrounding the reopening of the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom.  They are eligible to compete for this award also. 


4. The RFQ mentions working with the "...current Foundation-contracted
events planner and public relations firm..." Who is the current the
current firm? What is the contact's name and number?

Answer:   The public relations firm that the Foundation has contracted with is Susan Davis International the Events Planner that the Foundation has acquired is Peachey and Associates.  The Events Planner that gets this award will be required to work closely with these two companies.

5. When is the anticipated award date?
    
Answer: The anticipated award date is March 1, 2003
 
6. Is there a possibility of multiple awards to small businesses?
   
Answer: NARA anticipates making a single award for this requirement.

7. What constitutes as similar work / similar magnitude?

Answer:   a. Have you performed as an Events Planner in the past and if so was it on this scale, (involving as many activities, coordination efforts, high profile officials, etc...) 
b.  By magnitude we refer to dollar value. For example if you performed as an Events Planner where the dollar threshold was $25,000.00 and this project was for $100,000, that would not be the same magnitude of work.  There would be a lot more involved in a $100,000.00 project versus a $25,000.00 project. If you have performed as an Event s Planner on a $500,000.00 dollar project, it would safe to say that you could successfully accomplish this project.  

8. If the Offerors has not have any similar work/similar magnitude experience but does have years in event planning experience and can show in the RFQ that the Offerors can successfully do the work, will their RQF still be even consideration? 

Answer:  Based on the events that you have SUCCESSFULLY coordinated, and the magnitude of those efforts, we would determine if they would be considered relevant. 

9. Are there any cost that the government will be responsible for and should not be included in the Offerors bid, i.e., Insurance, liability? If so what are they?

Answer:  Any subcontract costs will be borne by NARA (see #11).

10. How many inquires/bidder for this RFQ ?

Answer: There is no way to anticipate how many quotes will be received for this effort.  We will know that at 3:30 on February 14, 03. 

11. Can the Event Planner have a partnering Events company or subcontract work out?

Answer.  Each agency can devise their quote any way the see fit to make the end result a success.  If you would like to hire someone/persons to assist in your effort that should be incorporated into your total fixed price amount. Your strategy of how to make this event successful, to include any work that you feel should be subcontracted out, will be taken into consideration as part of the evaluation for award. 

12. What is the turn around time when we will heard back if our RFQ is being considered?

Answer: We plan to make award no later than March 1, 03 and all unsuccessful bidders will be notified on or around that date. 

13. Do you want the brochures and or literature of our business?

Answer:  Any additional information that you can provide to better reflect your company?s credentials/abilities is appreciated. The most important information will be your past performance and your anticipated method of  performance for this project. 

14.  Will W.U. choose the P.R. firm? 

Answer:  No as stated in paragraph 4 above, The Foundation has a PR firm and NARA has Public Affairs personnel.  The Events Planner will work closely with these individuals.  

15. Will W.U. solicit the volunteers?
 
Answer: Yes, the Events Planner will be responsible for attaining volunteers where ever feasible.  

16. Do we provide the horses and horseman?
 
Answer:   The events planner will attempt to get volunteers, if this must be subcontracted out, the events planner will do the market research to get three sources and provide that information to NARA.  NARA will in turn issue a separate purchase for that service provided. 

17. Will there be any type of food provided, if so do we provide it?

Answer: The events planner will not be responsible for any food provided at any of the stated events. Just the coordination of the events.

18.  I was wondering how I could get more information regarding the request for proposals for the above event? Including how we might bid on such a project. I appreciate your response. 

Answer:  You would have to be more specific and state what additional information you are interested in.  Hopefully the attached questions will provide you with the additional information you need.


19.   Does the offeror need to include any Reps and Certs besides 52.212-3 and 52.212-5 in the proposal?

Answer:  To bid, simply forward your proposal based on the provided statement of requirements.  You will need to complete ALL areas of the Representations and Certifications.

 
20. a. Under the details section, September 17 reopening ceremony: At the
bottom, for the items in brackets: to what does the etc. refer?

Answer:  NARA has provided a basic agenda for what we envision to be a successful sequence of events surrounding the reopening of the Archives I.  What we are looking for from the successful awardee is the creativity to embellish on what we have provided to turn this event into something spectacular and memorable for all.  The etc? is what we are wanting the Events Planner to come up with.  
 
        b.  And, are they not asking for services with regard to preparing the invitation for
mailing, or any services in connection with the set up of the event itself? 

Answer:  We need the Events Planner to comprise the overall ?big picture? of  events that will transpire.  The specifics will be worked in more detail at a later date.   The invitations and things of that nature will/have already been handled by NARA and the Foundation.    

21.  Under the details section, September 18 thru 21st: At the bottom,
for the items in brackets: please clarify the meaning of coordinate media
coverage---does this mean the selected firm handles it entirely? Or does
the selected firm work with an in house media person?

Answer:  The events planner will work with in house and contracted media to coordinate media stops and coverage.
 
22. And to clarify the budget attachments required:

Answer:  Provide your total firm fixed price for this requirement.  ( A detailed breakdown of your cost is not required.)

23. Does the proposal require only the budgets for those components that the
contracted firm would be working on? For example, under September 17, there
are a lot of other costs connected with such a ceremony, but the proposal is
not asking for participation in those components. 

Answer:  While the ceremony is basically straightforward, the events planner should factor in any costs they think would be incurred to conduct a ceremony in the Rotunda.


24. In terms of the budget, are you asking for us to 
submit our budget for what it will cost to execute the event and/or or budget 
to execute the event alone. If so, is this inclusive of our costs?

Answer:  As stated in item #22 above, you are only required to submit a total lump sum price. 


25. How many pages should this RFQ be. Is there a limitation?

Answer: There is no limit to the number of pages submitted, however, please keep in mind that this is a simplified acquisition.

26. We are interested in responding to this request for proposal. What is due by what date? Is the complete proposal due on the 14th?
Answer:   February 14, 03 at 3:30 is the closing date for all submitted quotes to include a complete proposal.

27. PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The performance period referenced in the RFQ is for 90 days of planning between March 01 and October 15, 2003. Will your staff execute all the scheduled events during September or does the RFQ need to include planner fees for those three weeks as well? 

Answer: The Events Planner will be responsible for the planning and execution of all scheduled events and therefore should be reflected in your total bid price.  

28. COSTS: The RFQ calls for budgeting all costs. Does this mean I am expected to budget now for things such as: the actual copies of the Charters of Freedom, audio/visual (including lighting and video wall needs), generator power for all outdoor activities, travel accommodations for all of the 15 governors being invited, printing and mailing of all invitations, volunteers to provide tours of the Rotunda, public relations support referenced as "Media Coordination," and any other activities, suppliers or vendors that "I" foresee might be required? 

Answer: We need costs for a general look and feel of the day. Don't need to include invitations, volunteer tours of Rotunda, but if a video wall is needed, that would be included as overall look and feel of the day. 

29. SPONSORSHIPS: What percentage of the entire costs are you expecting to be realized through corporate or in-kind sponsorships? What benefits can be offered to partners? Are there any events that sponsors are not allowed to be represented at or included in? Will the sponsorships dollars be paid directly to the NARA Foundation, or will the planner use these monies to fund all scheduled activities? Is the planner responsible for producing the collateral materials needed for solicitation? 

Answer: Although we would like all of our costs covered, we expect only a small percentage of costs will be borne by partnerships. Money received would probably be deposited with our Foundation. 

30. PAYMENTS: Can you please clarify "Milestone Payments?" I couldn't find a reference to this language in Sec. 32 of the FAR. 

Answer:  NARA will authorize partial payments based on actual costs incurred/effort.  The specifics of these payments (i.e. frequency, amounts,) will be worked out after award. 

31.  CONTRACT LINE ITEM #: CLIN 0001. Where can I find information on what this means? 
SECURITY: There is no mention of security needs for any activities. Will the planner be responsible for planning and budgeting this cost? 

Answer: CLIN 0001 refers to the line item number for this project and there is only one, which is the Events Planner. The Events Planner will not be responsible for security.  

32.  MEDICAL/EMT SERVICES: Again, there is no mention of these services in the RFQ. 
Shall I budget for these costs now? 

Answer: No, however if these services will be needed, you should list them (but not necessarily include costs.) 

33. STREET CLOSINGS: For the actual week of the unveiling and tours at the NARA, do you anticipate activities to occur along the street such as within a mini fair/festival? 

Answer: Probably not, however we anticipate participating in a festival on the Pennsylvania side of our building for the weekend of September 20-22, 03, but should not require street closures. 

34. PAST PERFORMANCE REPORTS: I have been planning events for 15 years and opened my own small business in March of last year. In addition to the events I produced since last year, would you accept past performance reports from events I produced while being an employee of a company? I could supply letters of reference, etc. 

Answer: Yes, whether you worked independently or for an agency all past performance is welcomed to establish your abilities

<DESC>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has a need for consulting services related to its financial management systems.  The consultant will serve as Financial Management?s functional resource and work in coordination with Information Resources Management on technical changes affecting the legacy business financial system interfacing with the core financial system, ensuring compliance with financial management requirements.  As a government corporation subject to the Credit Reform Act of 1990, OPIC has unique accounting and budget needs.  The Corporation must keep three sets of books to accommodate the accounting requirements of the federal budget, of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), and of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  OPIC uses version 11i of Oracle Government Financials (OGF), with product extensions to handle federal government accounting and budget requirements, as its core financial system.  OGF links to the legacy business financial systems via an interface program that runs daily.  The legacy system has been moved to an APPX-based platform.  As part of the on-going interface process which ranges from recording entries in the legacy system to generating financial reports from the system of record, OPIC seeks consulting services to perform the following:  1) Assess the impact of the APPX-based platform on the daily interface process, as follows:  Assess ways to eliminate the complexity of transactions processed through the daily interface.
Advise on ways to prevent data entry errors at the source.  Review APPX functionality to suggest enhancements to simplify the daily processing of transactions.  Review the current method of processing daily transactions through the interface scripts to determine if script changes will improve efficiency of the process.  Devise ways to minimize the amount of follow up review required to ensure proper translation of transactions into OGF.  Assess and recommend changes to mapping tables, programs and other aspects of the daily conversion process as required.  Provide documentation for the various process flows, procedural changes and efficient reconciliations.  2)  Ensure that interface processes allow for timely and correct recording and reporting of data for internal and external users, as follows:  Recommend ways to improve the various reconciliation processes needed to ensure efficient, timely, and accurate processing of all financial transactions.   Assess the impact of internal policy and procedural changes on the processing of financial information and subsequent reporting requirements.  Assess the impact of Credit Reform regulations and recommend changes to the processing to ensure proper classification of credit reform transactions and interact with OMB to ensure compliance with reporting requirements.  Evaluate the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on financial management and ensure that the changes are reflected in the recording, processing, and reporting of financial information.  Design and develop parameters for reports for internal and external purposes that efficiently access financial data from both the legacy and the core financial systems.  As a result of the preceding assessments and evaluations, provide written recommendations and examples that can be used to implement those recommendations. The most successful candidate will have extensive technical and functional experience with Oracle Government Financials in a federal government entity (preferably a U.S. Government corporation) subject to GAAP, FASAB, budgetary, and federal credit reform regulations and reporting requirements.
The government contemplates a one (1) man-year effort .  The Period of Performance for the base year will be July 3, 2002 to July 4, 2003 with five one-year options. 
Your proposal should include (1) a detailed, written technical proposal explaining how your firm intends to meet the requirements contained in the Scope of Work; and (2) a price proposal on an hourly basis for the position you would dedicate to this effort.

The Task Order will be evaluated and awarded on a best value basis using the following evaluation criteria:  The evaluation criteria are listed i order of their relative importance:  (1) your understanding of the requirements.  (2) a description of your technical and management approach to accomplishing the requirements.  (3) corporate experience with federal government corporations subject to the Credit Reform Act of 1990; (4) familiarity with financial management software approved for federal government use; and (5) price.  

Your proposal must be received by fax, express mail or surface mail no later than the due date.  This request does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of proposals.  All firms involved with providing consulting services for OPIC will be requested to sign a Confidentiality Agreement.

<DESC>Statement of Needs:

Overview:

This is a total small business set-aside.  For this procurement a company is considered small if it has gross average annual sales for the proceeding three years of less than $6.0 million.  All responsible small businesses may submit an offer that will be considered.  The NAICS code for this action is 541430, Graphic Design Services, Size Standard $6.0 Million.  The Office of Personnel Management requires the services of a commercial vendor to provide design (consistent with OPM's established corporate image) for a wide range of products (i.e.: posters, charts, banners, flyers, pamphlets, books, etc...).  The vendor must be available/reachable 24/7.  Some orders may also require production of banners for indoor/outdoor use (1'x 10'- 4'x25') output and mounting of charts and posters on foam core (or equal), up to 3'x4', conversion of printing files for use on the Internet, and miscellaneous other graphic arts services.  This procurement will lead to the award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a period of performance of 1 year from the date of award.


Schedule:

Approximately 50% of the orders will be placed in the afternoon to late evening with delivery required by 8 am of the next day, 30% will require delivery within 2-3 days and the remaining 20% will be for 5 days or more.

If delivery is not made as required the order may no longer be required, and therefore the Government will render no payment.  If the product is still required only normal charges will be paid for the work performed (no surcharges).  Additionally, if the product does not match the approved proofs or furnished directions the Government reserves the right to reject the order and render no payment.

Contacts:

The vendor must provide contact names and phone numbers, as many orders will be placed late in the day or after normal business hours.

Pickup & Deliveries:
 
Contractor will pickup and deliver all materials to the Office of Personnel Management.  When possible government furnished material and deliverables will be transmitted electronically via email, to an FTP site, or as mutually agreed.

Frequency of Orders:

OPM is unable to predict with any certainty the frequency or orders, generally 1 - 4 orders will be placed each month.  Orders will be placed via telephone accompanied with a task order from the Publications Services Division.

Average number of orders per month will be 2.  Our estimate of the types of orders that will be placed is as follows:

10 invitations/cards (OPM to print orders that require printing/silk screening versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract) 1 color, stock furnished.

4 posters (OPM to print orders that require printing versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract), 2 - 4 colors, gloss finish stock, mounted on foam core, 2 - 10 copies for electronic production.

6 orders for charts/graphs, averaging 5 - 10 products per order, 2 - 4 colors, matte finish stock, mounted on foam core, 3' x 4'.

2 books, 48 - 250 pages (OPM to print), 2 - 4 colors.

6 banners, some with 2 or more products with the same or different images, 4-color process.

4 pamphlets, 4 - 16 pages (OPM to print), 2 - 4 colors.

2 orders requiring conversion of files for use on the Internet, these products will normally be the books or pamphlets produced under this contract.


Government Furnished Material:

When the Government deems it possible all materials will be furnished to the vendor electronically.  Otherwise, the vendor must pickup the GFM from the Office of Personnel Management or a mutually agreed upon location.


Samples:

When submitting your bid please provide samples of no less than 5 previous products designed by your company.


Proposal Preparation Requirements:

In submitting an offer for this project, the contractor must provide:

Technical Proposal (Original and two copies)
Resumes of key personnel
A description and samples of similar work performed in the last 24 months
Customer references including names and telephone numbers of company contacts
Timeline for completion of tasks and technical plan describing how work would be accomplished.
Minimum level of work/reimbursement needed to perform under this contract.
Price per hour for design work.
Price to produce products listed under Frequency of Orders (samples of these products are available for viewing at OPM in Room 5H35).

Vendor must address the following issues in their proposal:

Means of providing after hours service and contact information.

Evaluation:

A blanket purchase agreement will be established with the offeror OPM determines offers the best value.  Award from this solicitation will be made on a "best value" basis. In making that determination, selecting the successful offeror, the technical factors bear significantly more importance than cost, but cost could be the deciding factor if there are no essential technical differences among the most highly rated offers.


Technical Evaluation:

Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria. They are listed in descending order of importance:

Experience/ education of key personnel 
Quality of past performance based on input from references
Quality and relevance of plan for accomplishing work and other relevant information
Experience in performing similar projects
Approach for handling and sanitizing mail, or alternative delivery method (photocopy or digital transmission)


Cost Evaluation:

The OPM will evaluate the estimated prices you have proposed for the jobs listed in the "Frequency of Orders" section of the request for quotations in addition to the price per hour you have proposed for design work.  For evaluation purposes, we estimate there will be 775 design hours of service.

The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, so initial offers should be on terms most favorable to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror.

Please provide your response no later than March 28, 2003, at 3:00PM, to the following address:

<DESC>This is a modification to correct typographical errors in the notice issued on March 14, 2003.  This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in support of the Department of Defense (DoD), seeks practical, yet innovative methods for solving difficult, real-time resource allocation and scheduling problems in uncertain, partially-observable environments.  MDA desires to interact with academia and industry to review cutting-edge techniques and explore new solution concepts potentially across domains beyond missile defense with significant promise for applicability in supporting the Ballistic Missile Defense Decision Architecture (BMD-DA).

The objective of the BMD-DA is to identify, within the pressing, real-time constraints of a ballistic missile engagement, a sensor and weapon allocation policy that will be effective in defeating the threat.  During such an engagement, this system must determine when, and in what mode, various sensors will be employed to estimate the position and projected movement of a given target complex, comprised of re-entry vehicles, decoys, debris, etc. as well as the classification of its individual components.  This information, in turn, must be used to determine the most effective assignments for a limited number of weapons which may be used to destroy incoming targets.  Due to the complexity and high number of interacting factors in this system, determining the optimal allocation of sensor and weapon resources in real-time has proved to be challenging.  

DoD is currently working to deploy an initial missile defense capability in 2004, with an increasingly robust system to be implemented in subsequent years.  Initial testing of the BMD-DA is scheduled to begin in 2004 with initial deployment beginning in 2006.

To address the challenge of developing a practical BMD-DA, MDA desires to review promising mathematical and computing techniques with potential applicability to the problem domain.  Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Markov Decision Processes (particularly partially-observable MDPs); (2) Bayesian networks (BN), decision networks & other computational models for probabilistic inference and decision making; (3) approximate stochastic dynamic programming; (4) expert systems and other artificial intelligence methods; (5) neural networks & other adaptive techniques; (6) planning and scheduling approaches; (7) game-theoretic approaches; (8) stochastic optimization; (9) parallel computing algorithms, and other methods for improved computational efficiency; and (10) methods to evaluate the quality of a given resource allocation policy when the global optimum is unavailable.

Given the limited time available before deployment of the BMD-DA, proposed approaches should emphasize run-time efficiency and scalability to realistic problem scales.  MDA is particularly interested in solutions with potential to transition to the BMD-DA over the next decade.  It is strongly preferred that proposed solutions rely only on technology expected to be available over that time horizon.


MDA will review responses to this RFI to determine compatibility with the goals stated above, and intends to invite authors of selected responses to a conference scheduled for the week of May 12, 2003 to review future research directions for advanced algorithms supporting Command & Control, Battle Management, & Communications (C2BMC) in national missile defense.  The conference will be based on a working panel format in which authors will brief their ideas and field questions and comments from a review panel.  The outcome of the conference will be the generation of a roadmap for model and algorithm development that will support the deployment of an effective missile defense decision architecture over the next decade.


The government invites interested parties to submit presentation abstracts and candidate solution methods.  Abstracts should be 1-2 pages in length, and provide the following information: (1) title; (2) author & contact information; (3) abstract to include the following: summary of the solution concept; discussion of why this approach appears to be promising; suggested success criteria; representative performance results, if available; and anticipated applicability to missile defense weapon & sensor allocation; (4) recent work performed relevant to the abstract; (5) organization(s) for which the work was performed; and (6) references and papers supporting the abstract.

Any anticipated limits, constraints, or costs related to testing or distributing required software should be clearly stated, as well as any proprietary & non-disclosure requirements. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  

Authors should send responses electronically (in Word or PDF format) to Ms. Joy Smith (Joy.Smith@bmdo.osd.mil, telephone 703-695-9209) at MDA/CTI no later than 04/18/2003. 

This is a request for information (RFI) and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the government will issue a procurement.  The government does not intend to otherwise pay for information received in response to the RFI.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to omit clause 52.225-1 and clarify the following:

1) Alarm price needs to include shipping costs.
2) Emphasize that orders are received from posts as needed. Some weeks there won't be orders, some weeks there will be. The vendor does not need to stock all 2000 alarms but will have to be able to ship the alarms ordered on an as needed basis within a reasonable time of the order being placed to the vendor. A reasonable time for shipping to SA-32T from time of order is one-two weeks. The orders can be as small as 1 alarm to 100's
3) Explain the way it has worked so far is that the vendor bills the Department of State after they ship a particular order of alarms to SA-32T. 



BRAND NAME OR EQUAL  ALL OR NONE.  NO SPLIT SHIPMENTS. MUST MEET ALL SPECIFICATIONS. SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRED. F.O.B. DESTINATION. LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA). REQUIRED DELIVERY: APRIL 30, 2003.

All responsible small businesses may submit a quote which if timely received shall be considered by the agency.


Vendors shall fax quote by the deadline to P.O.C.
Vendors shall call to confirm receipt after faxing quote.

Under the proposed continuation, the Contractor will continue to maintain the “Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SACCC) for the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS)” by providing overall project management, scientific and analytical support to investigators and to NIH programmatic staff  for the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS).  This Contractor is responsible for the planning, implementation, and overall coordination of field activities, data and biological specimens collection, collation, and management.  The Contractor also provides critical statistical and epidemiologic support to the WITS investigators and has a crucial role in the performance and productivity of the project as a whole.  Interruption of the SACCC’s activities will lead to complete paralysis of clinical and biological data collation and processing, analysis of results, development of further scientific concepts and publication  and impede the longitudinal analysis of health outcomes of mothers and children affected by HIV/AIDS. The Division of AIDS requires this continuation to coincide with the completion of the WITS project over the next four years.  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>Microarrays
<DESC>The John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Wayne State University, Division of Molecular Medicine and Genetics for microarrays.  The proposed contract action is for purchase of microarrays needed to investigate the hypothesis that Osteonectin, TIMP-1 and Intelectin gene expressions are markers of malignant transformation of mesothelial cells to mesothelioma which will help define the prognosis of patients with MPM, and influence pathways associated with the pathogenesis of mesothelioma.  A preliminary data set had been defined utilizing the Wayne State Molecular Laboratory and it's services.  The research team now needs to validate and confirm it's findings by analyzing a second set of RNA samples.  It is imperative to the research study's accuracy that the same batch/lot of microarrays and hybridization conditions be utilized to achieve significance in the correlation of clinical parameters with the prognostication of these patient samples.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(A).  All FAR provisions and clauses may be reviewed and/or obtained from the General Service Internet address http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation documents will be issued.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses received, is solely the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered soley for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Firms that believe they can meet the VA's requirements must submit proof to the Contracting Officer no later than April 2, 2003, 3:00PM local time.

If quoting on an ?or Equal? vendor must include sufficient information to allow evaluation. Please quote FOB Destination pricing. Contractor must be CCR registered to receive award. Take note of the following provisions: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items; 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items; 52.212-3 (ALT III); 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items; Take note of the following stipulation: PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER?CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999) (a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term ?EFT? refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-- (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database. (f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-- (i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-- (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. (g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. (j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. (End) F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991) (a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means -- (1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and (2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee. (b) The Contractor shall -- (1) (i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or (ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements; (2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading; (3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract; (4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract; (5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and (6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.

SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall provide Event planning/coordination services for the events and activities surrounding the rededication of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom.  Quotes must include:
     - Development of a plan, budget, and timeline for all activities (see detail section)..
     - Outreach to strategic and corporate partners for sponsorship and in-kind support, maximizing the use of volunteers.
     - Close communications and partnering with the current Foundation-contracted events planner and public relations firm and the Archivist's staff to ensure the seamless coordination of all events.
     - While the Government expects that most participants and vendors will be unpaid volunteers, if contracts are required, perform detailed market research and recommend suppliers and vendors to the NARA contracting activity while ensuring timely completion of contracted events.
     -  At the completion of this project, the events planner must provide a summary report, which will also serve as the basis for final payment. 
Details:
- Fifty years ago, on December 15, 1952, the most sacred documents of our history, the Charters of Freedom - the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights were formally enshrined in the National Archives. On July 4, 2001, access to the Charters and to the Rotunda was halted as extensive restoration and renovation projects began.
- The National Archives will unveil the newly restored Charters of Freedom at a rededication ceremony at the National Archives on September 17, 2003, Constitution Day.  This is the first in a series of events culminating in the opening of the National Archives Experience in July 2004.  Events marking the return of the Charters will take place the week prior, during, and after the rededication.
- Planned events include:
? September 6th - Saturday (or sooner depending on media stops). Copies of the Charters of Freedom begin the journey by horseback from Philadelphia to their resting place in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom. Assuming progress of about 15 miles a day, the Charters would be scheduled to arrive at the National Archives on Tuesday, September 16th.  [Planner would be required to work with NARA to determine route of the journey, solicit participation from equestrian groups, work with PR firm to coordinate services of local police departments, media, veterinary services (if needed), State Governors, District government regarding route and road closures, etc.]
? September 12th - Friday. This day would be set aside for the day-long preview of the Rotunda and Charters of Freedom by NARA staff. College Park, Federal Register and Washington National Records Center (WNRC) staff would be bused to the National Archives Building. [Although this event would be coordinated by NARA staff, the planner would serve as an advisor.]
? September 16th - Tuesday.  The copies of the Charters of Freedom arrive at the National Archives Building by horseback, with full military pomp and circumstance. The Charters are ceremoniously carried up the steps and delivered to the Archivist at the bronze doors entrance. Once the Archivist receives and carries them inside the Rotunda, a military honor guard assumes its post at the doors. It will remain in place until the formal reopening the morning of the 17th. Once night falls on the 16th, bathe the bronze doors and honor guard in spotlights shining up the ceremonial steps.  [Planner would be required to plan the day's events including working with the District government regarding route and road closures, permission for evening spotlights, coordinating with the Military Commander for the District of Columbia to acquire the services of the U.S. military (bands, color guards, etc.), etc.] 
? September 17th - Wednesday. The Charters of Freedom recognize and delineate our rights as Americans. That should be the theme for the day. As such, let's recognize and celebrate those whose efforts to ensure those rights came before us - a group of veterans; those who protect our rights today - a contingent of soldiers representative of the color and gender of our Armed Forces; those who teach our rights as Americans - a group of teachers, one from every school jurisdiction in the metropolitan area; and those who are just learning about their rights - a group of schoolkids, again, one from each school jurisdiction.
- Also invited to attend the Rotunda reopening will be former Presidents of the United States, the Mayor of Washington, National Archives Foundation Board members and special invitees, and senior NARA staff. Others to be invited as space allows. Adequate space must be retained for the media. 
- At the official opening of the Rotunda invited participants include the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush, former Presidents including Nancy Reagan representing President Reagan, Lady Bird Johnson, the Chief Justice of the United States, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, and the Governors of the first 13 states enter the Rotunda. All are greeted by the Archivist. This event should be broadcast and shown on the Internet.
- The ceremony should take about an hour. Upon conclusion, the Rotunda and galleries would be made available to the media for tours, interviews, film set ups, etc. [Planner would be required to work with NARA on obtaining approval from the District government on possible road closures, permission to use a video wall on the steps of Constitution Ave., coordinate with Military Commander on obtaining military bands and color guards, advising NARA on proper protocol for invited dignitaries, etc.]
- September 18th - 21th.  The 18th should serve as the Grand Reopening to the Public day with special public activities through the 21st.  [Planner would assist NARA in all logistics pertaining to the reopening to the public; short welcoming speech by the Archivist; explore cost and acquisition of commemorative souvenir for opening day visitors; coordinate media coverage.]
 - Week of September 22nd - Education Week. Invite 3rd or 4th grade students or other appropriate grades from all area jurisdictions - D.C., Montgomery, Prince Georges, Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax counties. Students and their teachers would be given guided tours of the Rotunda, educational packets, and a small remembrance of their visit.  [Planner would assist NARA in logistics pertaining to Education Week.]
