Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8 (a) Certification letter (if applicable).

<CONTACT>Annette  Harkless, (405)  954-8925
<DESC>The FAA's Aviation Safety (AVS) organization that is responsible for promoting aviation safety by regulating and overseeing the civil aviation industry intends to issue a contract for its Aircraft Certification Service (AIR) organization located in Fort Worth, TX.   The AIR organization is responsible for developing, administering and ensuring compliance to standards governing the design, production, airworthiness, and continued operational safety of civil aircraft and related components.  Among AIR's most valuable assets are the knowledge, skills, and abilities of its workforce.  This is especially true in the issuance of engineering and manufacturing approvals for aircraft design, related components, and production systems.  Data generated during original certifications is used as a basis for design and production modifications, some of which may occur twenty or more years after the original approval.  Currently AIR personnel are dependent on labor-intensive work processes and an archaic paper-based information system.  These processes, combined with limited resources, could lead to decreased operational productivity and mission effectiveness and negatively impact management oversight of the AIR designees' workforce. In order to provide continued operational safety, AIR needs an integrated source of safety and compliance information and processes organized for easy, quick access, anytime, anyplace.  Automated tools are needed for capturing knowledge and work metrics as part of normal work activities.  Contemporary practices are required for increasing collaboration such as the use of electronic meetings to share project information.  Automated tools are required for analyzing data to predict potentially unsafe conditions and for providing easily accessible management information.  The Aviation Safety Knowledge Management Environment (ASKME) will meet these identified needs by storing AIR knowledge assets making them accessible, facilitating management and workforce decision making, providing a proactive system safety approach, and improving productivity in accomplishing the AIR mission.   This announcement is a Market Survey used to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA Certified 8(a) and Small Business concerns.   At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other Small Business competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512, with a size standard of $21.0 Million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(a) Certification letter (if applicable).  Failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA SEDB 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.   The contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, equipment and the services necessary to perform the requirements in the Statement of Work attached. The FAA intends to have any resultant contract in place by December 15, 2006.  The anticipated period of performance is 12-months. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 10 type-written pages. No type font less than 12-point may be used. Interested sources are required to provide the following:         (1) a capability summary describing the corporate approach to performing the work specified.  At a minimum it shall address the following: a)  The vendor's overall corporate structure from a technical perspective; i.e., how it is aligned (top-down) to oversee, manage and ensure quality services to the Customer.  b)  The vendor's access to additional resources, skills, subcontractors, subject matter experts, etc., if necessary, to successfully perform the proposed effort.  c)  The vendor's program management support, data analysis, planning techniques, and other resources to be employed in rendering the products and services described in the each of major tasks specified above.  d)  The vendor's overarching cost and schedule management controls to be employed in performing the major tasks specified above.           (2) information concerning contracts which are considered relevant in demonstrating ability to perform the proposed effort for a Government agency or private company.   At a minimum, the description shall include the information below for contracts performed within the past three (3) years:   Project title/description Customer name  Project start-end dates  Project value  Client point of contact (POC) information including e-mail address and telephone number  Description of work performed  Description of why the work is relevant to the proposed effort  The FAA will not be liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.   Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no solicitation exists at this time; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  All responses/submittals, including attachments, should be submitted electronically to the following email address: annette.harkless@faa.gov.  (Reference market survey DTFAAC-07-R-00006). All responses/submittals, including attachments, should be submitted in either Microsoft Word, or portable document format (pdf).  Also please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per e-mail, therefore responses/submittals may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received. If you cannot respond electronically, please send one (1) copy to: Federal Aviation Administration Attn:  Annette Harkless, Contracting Officer, AMQ-320 P.O. Box 25082  6500 S.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is procuring services under Solicitation HSCG84-07-Q-AA8183 which will be available on or about September 21, 2006 via FedBizOps. In an event of severe weather, during the hurricane season which runs from May 1 to November 30, members of the Joint Forces Offices (JFO) of the U. S. Coast Guard Sector New Orleans would need a safe location that is away from current hurricane and potential future hurricane hazards and dangers to lives. The facility would need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead U. S. Coast Guard post hurricane operations.  The U. S. Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the "first right" to use the facility in an event of severe weather affecting the Gulf shore resulting in evacuation of New Orleans, LA.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than tropical force winds, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for JFO stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit, this will require that USCG Sector New Orleans JFO members to stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  It is anticipated that the minimum period of time would be 3 days with a maximum of 42 days per occurrence.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The JFO location needs to be located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in order for the team to work out of the Integrated Command Post located in Baton Rouge.  A total of 25 hotel rooms will be needed.  Parking will be needed for up to 50 vehicles.  The NAICS code is 721110.  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing October 2006.  All vendors will be responsible for obtaining the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the above site.  Any and all questions regarding the solicitation should be submitted, in writing, to Mrs. Roberta Smith at Roberta.H.Smith@uscg.mil.  This requirement will be issued using Full and Open Competition procedures.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232.33.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The USDA/FSA/Conservation and Environmental Programs Division, has a requirement for the following: Any companies that has the capability to provide such services should submit capability statements to: USDA/FSA/Acquisition Management Division/SpecialProjects Branch, Attn: Alonzo Jacobs at 1280 Maryland Avenue, SW, Portals Bldg., Suite 580A, Washington, DC 20024, not later than October 31, 2006 at 3:00PM. This address accepts USPS and Express Mail deliveries. This requirement will require a firm that has the ability to capably manage an effort that wiil produce 20 (Twenty) Individual Programmatic Environmental Assessments in 20 States. This effort may require extensive subcontractor effort and presence in those 20 States. Companies that are capable and interested should forward capability statements, and experiences in managing an effort of this scope and complexity, and be capable of delivering high quality technical products. Companies that are experienced in delivering this service may share with USDA its experiences, problems encountered and any suggestions that may aid USDA in acquiring these services.

Conservation Reserve Program
Twenty Individual Programmatic Environmental Assessments

1.  INTRODUCTION

The Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, authorized the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).  The program is governed by regulations published in 7 CFR, part 1410.  The program is implemented by FSA on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture?s Commodity Credit Corporation.

CRP is the largest voluntary conservation program operated by the Federal government and has implemented conservation practices on over 36 million acres of private land.   CRP has evolved from its early roots as primarily an erosion control initiative to an environmental program that addresses diverse local and national natural resource priorities.  The program offers participants annual rental payments for 10 to 15 years and cost share assistance to eligible producers who establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible land to reduce soil erosion, improve water quality, and enhance wildlife habitat.  FSA bases rental rates on the relative productivity of the soils within each county and the average cash rent or cash rent equivalent.

Haying and Grazing 
Haying and grazing of CRP acreage is authorized under certain conditions to improve the quality and performance of the CRP cover or to provide emergency relief to livestock producers due to certain natural disasters. There are two types of haying and grazing authorization: managed and emergency.
 
Primary Nesting Season 
Generally, CRP acreage may not be hayed or grazed during the Primary Nesting Season for certain wildlife established by state FSA committees in consultation with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) State Technical Committee.
 
Managed Haying and Grazing 
Managed haying and grazing is authorized no more frequently than one out of every three years after the CRP cover is fully established. Managed haying and grazing may be available less frequently in a particular area depending upon local conditions, resource capacity, and the conservation goals of the program. Also, acreage either hayed or grazed under managed or emergency provisions in either of the previous two years is ineligible for managed haying or grazing in the current year.

Managed haying is authorized for a single period up to 90 days. Managed grazing is authorized for a single period up to 120 days or for two 60-day periods. CRP participants requesting managed haying and grazing must file a request with their local FSA office indicating the acreage to be hayed or grazed before the activity begins. Additionally, CRP participants requesting managed haying and grazing are assessed a 25 percent payment reduction except when managed haying and grazing is conducted in an "emergency" area.


2.  OBJECTIVE

The Agency seeks the services of an experienced contractor to coordinate all relevant environmental planning, studies, and documentation services, including public involvement and coordination support, for the preparation of 20 individual Programmatic Environmental Assessments (PEA) for the following States:

Arizona	New York
California	North Dakota
Colorado	Oklahoma
Idaho	Oregon
Indiana	South Dakota
Kansas	Texas
Montana	Utah
Nebraska	Washington
Nevada	Wisconsin
New Mexico	Wyoming

Due to the size and complexity of the tasks related to this contract, it is envisioned that the Contractor shall serve as a Prime Contractor working with other consulting firms and utilizing subcontractors in each of the 20 States to furfill the requirements of this project. It is highly recommended that qualified state environmental consulting firms, familiar with state agricultural and wildlife issues, be used in completion of these PEAs.

The State-level PEAs shall specifically focus on the potential effects of allowing managed haying and grazing on land enrolled in CRP and the potential impacts on ground nesting birds and other wildlife.  The primary focus of these PEAs shall be but are not limited to:
?	Establishment of beginning and ending dates for primary nesting seasons;
?	Frequency of allowing managed haying or grazing;
?	Intensity (stocking rates);
?	Effects of managed haying and grazing on environmental resources such as soil, water, wildlife, and plants;
?	Effects of managed haying and grazing on various conservation practices; 
?	Effects of managed haying and grazing on different land types such as riparian areas versus upland areas; and
?	Socio-economic factors.

Each of the PEA documents prepared for the 20 States shall be consistent in their analysis, methodology, and approach with multiple Alternatives being examined.  All PEAs shall be as clear and concise as possible in accordance with 40 CFR Sec. 1508.9. FSA recognizes that programmatic NEPA documents can be substantial in size; however, the analysis shall not be more excessive than necessary to inform the decision makers of the environemtnal impacts.

In addition, such analysis shall consider a managed haying and grazing alternative that seeks to optimize the benefits of that activity, consistent with meeting soil conservation and water quality objectives of CRP with FSA seeking the input of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on such alternative.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  The Contractor shall supply all necessary labor, materials, expertise etc. to successfully complete all relevant Federal and State statutory and regulatory requirements necessary to complete 20 individual PEAs.  Any and all software, data, and other materials acquired during this project are the property of FSA and shall be turned over to FSA at the close of this project.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO DELETE THE STATEMENT  THAT ?PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE EVALUATED UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT?, AND REVISE THE STATEMENT ?PROPOSAL EVALUATIONS WILL BE COMPLETED NOT EARLIER THAN 60 DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT?, TO READ,  ?PROPOSAL EVALUATIONS FOR ALL PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS WILL BE COMPLETED NOT EARLIER THAN 60 DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT? AS CITED UNDER THE HEADING ?ADDITIONAL INFORMATION?, SECOND PARAGRAPH.  THE MSTAR BAA IS REISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-06-MSTAR-BAA MODIFICATION 01.

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  

MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary?s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, MDA must be able to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through fundamental scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This push is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Advanced Technology Deputate (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.
  
MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program in order to sponsor fundamental, BMDS relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program, administered by MDA/DV, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MSTAR is a competitive, science and technology university research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

This BAA will remain open until December 29, 2006.  Offerors may submit separate proposals on any or all the specified topic areas of research. Proposal evaluations for all proposal submissions will be completed not earlier than 60 days after the close of the announcement.  Offerors may be contacted by the reviewers as necessary for additional information/clarifications.  

The Government may use selected FFRDC, support contractor, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors and other non-governmental personnel to assist the Government during the evaluation process.

The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential Conflict of Interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. In addition, the contractor shall be subject to the clause LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (EPAAR 1552.209-74), which may limit the contractor?s eligibility to perform work as a prime Contractor or subcontractor under an ensuing EPA contract, further, that for the life of this contract the contractor shall be ineligible to enter into a contract to perform work for any of the following types of firms unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer: (1) Firms within the regulated community that discharge processed water or which provide treatment of wastewater or drinking water. (2) Firms that manufacture/sell/import water treatment chemicals and/or equipment, to include firms that manufacture/sell/import point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment devices. (3) Firms that provide advisory and/or technical services relating to waste minimization, waste management, and wastewater treatment and control for regulated industries.  (4) Firms that act in a consulting, advisory, or legal capacity with, or for, firms trying to overturn or avoid application of effluent guidelines or regulations within the scope of this work could manipulate data outcomes to effect a particular determination in favor of their clients, and   (5) Firms that own or operate community water systems. The requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.522 million.

Background:

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers conducting research on treatment, prevention, diagno?sis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infection and disease in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations, including both domestic and international clinical sites. The NICHD is interested in identifying whether there any interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to serve as the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Studies Coordinating Center, which encompasses both clinical trials on the treatment and management of HIV infection in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and non-pregnant women domestically and internationally, including infrastructure development as well as clinical trials. The Coordinating Center contract currently encompasses several inter-related projects: the NICHD Network of clinical trials sites; the Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI); a trial of post-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-exposed infants (NICHD/HPTN 040 Trial); the India Perinatal Project; and site monitoring for phase III investigator-initiated clinical trials.

Scope of activities:

Current activities conducted within the Coordinating Center contract include the following:

	NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network

The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network (NICHD Network) has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987.  The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.  The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) and Adult ACTG funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN), and Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 20 centers, located in 18 cities, in 10 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are six international clinical trials sites: five sites in different areas of Brazil, and one in the Bahamas.    NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials.  The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols.  The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.  

	Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative 

Through the experience of the NICHD Network with directly opening antiretroviral drug treatment trials in sites in Brazil and Bahamas in 1998 and 1999, NICHD identified a need for further training and development to increase Latin American and Caribbean capacity for the conduct of clinical trials, particularly those involving experimental drugs.  During 2000, NICHD and Coordinating Center began the NICHD International Site Development Initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean (NISDI) to address this need.  NISDI is designed to provide capacity-building and training to international sites through the conduct of two observational studies: one in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants; and the other in HIV-exposed, but uninfected infants and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents. The goal of this initiative is to train investigators and develop sites that will be able to participate in future international prevention and treatment trials. The Coordinating Center currently subcontracts with 25 sites in six countries participating in the protocols from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Bahamas, Jamaica and Peru.  As of July 2006 there were 1,136 pregnant women and 1,522 pediatric patients enrolled into their respective protocols.  

	Clinical Trial of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of HIV-Exposed Infants in Latin America and the U.S.

NICHD, through the Coordinating Center contract, is conducting a study to evaluate the efficacy of antiretroviral prophylaxis provided only to the infant in situations in which the mother has not received any antiretroviral therapy prior to delivery.  This includes women who are first identified as HIV-infected during labor, and therefore are unable to receive antepartum or intrapartum prophylaxis. This study compares three different types of post-exposure prophylaxis in such infants standard zidovudine for six weeks to the infant (standard in Brazil and U.S.); a combination of zidovudine with nevirapine; and a triple combination of zidovudine, nevirapine and nelfinavir.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for all aspects of clinical trials management, including protocol and forms design, drug repository and dispensation, regulatory issues, data management and data analysis.  Participating sites include 6 sites in the US, 8 sites in Brazil, 1 site in Argentina, and 1 site in South Africa in Johannesburg with a second site in Cape Town about to open.  

	India Perinatal Initiative 

Collaboration with investigators in southern India on a perinatal HIV prevention project was initiated in late 2000, entitled "An observational study of the seroprevalence of, and interventions to decrease the risk of maternal to child transmission of HIV in Tamil Nadu, India".  During Stage I of the study, all pregnant women registered in the antenatal clinics were offered the opportunity to participate in an educational session about HIV infection and transmission. Pre- and post-session assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were administered to a random sample of women.  Voluntary counseling and HIV testing were offered to all women, and the seroprevalence rated was estimated.  Enrollment into this part of the protocol took place between December 2003 and December 2004.   During Stage II, those women identified as HIV-infected were offered enrollment in a prospective cohort study and offered antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother to child transmission (initially zidovudine, then zidovudine plus single-dose nevirapine).  Enrollment into this part of the protocol began in early 2004, and the final subject study visits were completed in May 2006.    It is anticipated that close-out of sites, analyses and laboratory testing of stored samples from this study will continue into the new Coordinating Center project period.

	Site Monitoring of Phase III NICHD-Funded Investigator Initiated International trials

As the NICHD international research grant portfolio has increased to include large phase III clinical trials conducted in resource-limited countries, there is an increasing need to ensure that such investigator-initiated trials are conducted ethically, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, and with attention to human subject safety.  The Coordinating Center will conduct site monitoring for selected NICHD grantees conducting large clinical trials to ensure appropriate trial conduct.  The Coordinating Center is currently performing site monitoring for the NICHD-funded NEVEREST (Nevirapine Resistance Study) trial evaluating response to therapy in women and children exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of mother to child transmission being conducted in South Africa.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to specifically request information from industry regarding the proposed CLIN structure of the Book Personalization Operations, found in Section B.4.6 and Table B.7.   Questions/comments regarding other areas of the RFP will not be accepted at this time.   As currently structured, the book personalization operations CLIN contains graduated level of volume and requests a unit rate per passport at each level.   The Department of State envisions that at the beginning of each contract year, the contractor will be given a quantity estimate for the year, for example, the vendor may be told that the expected quantity is 4,500,000.    This estimate would be updated as needed  throughout the period of performance.    As passports are produced, the vendor would charge the government the unit price for the range 4,000,001 to 5,000,000.   The Department is contemplating an alternative structure where the vendor would offer a firm, fixed-price for a given capacity.  Using the example above, the vendor would offer $XXXXXX for 4,000,001 to 5,000,000 passports and would receive this amount regardless if 4,000,001 passports or 4,999,999 passports were needed.   Performance metrics and incentives/disincentives would ensure that the vendor is motivated to produce the maximum amount possible.  In this second scenario, the Department solicits feedback from industry on methods to compensate the vendor in the event the actual production exceeds the capacity ordered, e.g. the vendor is asked to actually print 5,225,000 books.    Comments are requested by 4:00 p.m. EST via e-mail to MejiaKJ at state dot gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED AND MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED.

<RESPDATE>102706

<CONTACT>Steve Bense Contract Specialist 708-786-5175
<DESC>This is a correction to a previously published sources sought announcement, changing the final date for response and correcting the NAICS code.  Interested vendors should contact the contracting officer, via email (steve.bense@va.gov), as part of this market research.  No collect calls.  Interested vendors who have already responded to earlier announcements from the contracting officer on this topic need not respond to this correction. The VA National Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program is intending to replace its current direct-to-patient distribution contract. The basic operation of the current contract is synopsized as follows:  - Automated transmissions, to the contractor, of prescriptions from each CMOP facility.  - Contractor maintains sufficient on-hand stock for real-time fulfillment of prescriptions within a minimum time period.  - Contractor expeditiously ships the prescriptions direct to the patient within a minimum time period.  - Contractor timely invoices each CMOP for prescription fulfillment. In general, the prescribed products being delivered direct to the patient consist of approximately 1,000 different types of medical / surgical (MED/SURG) items (e.g.: syringes, adult diapers, dressing kits, etc.) and some over-the-counter (OTC) products (e.g.: dietary supplements, etc.).  The prescriptions being delivered will be shipped direct to veteran patients who are located in any part of the United States or its territories, and will vary in product size. This is a correction to the previously published and modified sources sought announcement.  This is not an announcement of a solicitation, nor is it a request for proposals or quotations.  Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website for any further information related to this topic.

The number of awards the government may award is still under consideration, however at this point in time the government may award as many as 8 contracts but anticipates awarding  approximately 5 contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP may identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small and provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and; (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued in early 2007.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at www.eps.gov./ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the fedbizopps website under IVL (Interested Vendor?s List). This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Logistics Command Maintenance Center has a requirement for an integral air conditioning system for a MK48 Logistics Vehicle System (LVS) cab and the cabin of a USMC HMMWV.  Currently these up-armored vehicles have Red Dot Corp. systems that mount the condenser and fan components on the exterior of the vehicles. The Maintenance Center is interested in the possibility of keeping the entire system within the confines of the vehicles and an increased resistance of the components to sea spray corrosion.   The requirement is for (1) one each sample A/C system for each vehicle type. The systems will be for testing purposes. Any award for sample systems will include the drawings and rights to the designs etc. The possibility of multiple awards for this requirement exists.  A site visit is encouraged to examine the vehicles unless a potential source has past performance supplying A/C units for similar applications or is familiar with the vehicles.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT

The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for Building 6 Seismic Upgrade Project Construction services.  

Building 6 is a one-story steel framed building built in approximately 1941.   It is circular in plan with a diameter of 161?-4? and a height at the perimeter of 44 feet.  The dome rises to a height of 81 feet at the center of the building.  It is separated from the surrounding annex building by a 7-1/2 inch joint.  The structural system of Building 6 is a steel braced frame.  The roof is supported by a system of arched steel roof trusses, which are supported by 24 steel columns at the perimeter of the building.  A 30 ton radial bridge crane is supported by a center pivot and another 24 steel crane columns.

The Building 6 lateral system is diagonal steel bracing located around the perimeter of the building.  The original structure has been modified with some original braces removed and some replaced by 4? x 3-1/2? double angles connected to gussets with high-strength bolts.

Considerations in the selection of the seismic upgrade approach were the congested nature of Building 6 which appears to preclude the use of heavy lifting equipment to install new structural steel.  The presence of sensitive laboratory equipment and the desire to minimize concrete demolition or welding are also primary considerations.  

The proposed seismic upgrade project includes the replacement of existing steel braces, new connections, and modifications to the radial crane central support.  These are described below:

All of the existing double angle lower tier braces will be replaced with new double channel braces.  Then layout will generally match existing layout except that the work-point at the base will be approximately at he top of existing floor slab.  In some cases, the work point will be slightly higher to permit the braces to avoid existing equipment.  

New connections will be provided at the ends of the replaced braces.  These will have larger gussets sized to meet the required demands.  The connection of the double channels to the gusset plates will be one of three methods: high-strength bolting with shop drilled holes, high-strength bolting with field drilled holes, or welding.  It is anticipated one end of the double angle braces will be connected with high-strength bolting with shop drilled holes and the other with either high-strength bolting with field drilled holes to provide installation tolerance.  Welding will be limited to the braced to column connections on the ground level only. 

At the upper tier of bracing, some existing connections will be replaced similar to the approach described above.

The restraint of the crane bridge beam central support will be modified to provide additional lateral stiffness.  This is anticipated to be accomplished by adding new stiffer lateral springs.

The relocation, temporary work and modification of plumbing and fire protection systems will be provided where systems are affected by or would impede the structural modification work.  Similar electrical relocation and modification work will be Owner-performed.

The total construction cost for the work is estimated to be between $1 million and 5 million dollars.  The project will occur during three six-week shut-down periods:  Phase I starting on May 14, 2007; Phase II beginning on or about April 1, 2008; Phase III commencing on or about April 1, 2009.  Around-the-clock work will be permitted during the first 4 weeks of the 6 week periods, and day shift only will be available for the remaining 2 weeks.  Other contractors and client labor forces will be performing work during the same timeframe.  The contractor will be required to share access, use of cranes, etc. during these shut-down periods. 

Three lay-down areas will be provided to the contractor for storage of materials required for construction:  a remote one in the Building 51 parking area, one small area adjacent to Building 6, and one designated location within the perimeter of the work area.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  FOR:  High Temperature Database for the development of Advanced Turbine Engine Mechanical Systems. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/PRTM), Propulsion Directorate, Turbine Engine Division is considering the award of a sixty (60) month program which will require operation, mechanical design, instrumentation, and installations of laboratory test machines to measure the mechanical and physical properties of high temperature lubricants, bearing materials, and the performance of bearing systems. Anticipated solicitation release date is 1st or 2nd Quarter CY 2007.  The purpose of this synopsis is to provide the AF technical team with the ability to determine capabilities of potential respondents.  The goal of this effort is to extend and document a database of design requirements and material capability for mechanical systems of turbine engines for manned and unmanned aircraft being developed under Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) Program.  The effort will be performed predominantly on site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  Test planning, data reduction, and interpretation of all results will be required.  Typical data will include rolling contact fatigue, friction and wear characterization of bearing, cage and gear materials, and the performance of foil and full scale rolling element bearings.  Businesses interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing the company?s technical expertise, experience, and facilities to accomplish the work described above.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center Nutrition Department intends to procure on an urgent and compelling sole source basis to US Foodservice, Inc at:

US Foodservice, Inc.
Baltimore/Washington Division (2C)
P.O. Box 728
8024 Telegraph Road
Severn, MD  21144

to continue to provide  the following food supplies and estimated quantities for the following period of November 15, 2006 to May 14, 2007 The listing of food supplies and estimated average quantities over the last 9 months is posted as a separate file on FedBiz Opps. 

The Nutrition Department implemented a Nutrition Information System in November, 2003.  For all food 
required a Clinical Dietitian must review all  ingredients and approve before it can be provided/served to a 
patient because there are compliancies that the Nutrition Department has to adhere to for JCAHO and safe
patient care. The Nutrition Department completed a comprehensive inventory with US Foods when the
Nutrition Information System was implemented in 2002.  

Requirements for Food Distribution services to be provided include, but are not limited to the following

Food will be ordered using an electronic on-line system.  

Food ordered on Monday will be delivered on Wednesday between
6:30-8:30am

Food ordered on Wednesday will be delivered on Friday between
6:30-8:30am

Food ordered on Friday will be delivered on Monday between 
6:30am-8:30am

Substitutions ? Dieticians must receive notice of any product that is not available at the time of product order.  All substitutions must be approved by a Clinical Dietitian in advance of delivery.  In the event that US Foods can?t provide an appropriate substitute the government reserves the right to purchase required
items from another vendor. 
   
The contractor providing the services must have the requisite experience in providing food distribution services as described above.

This requirement is deemed to be urgent and compelling under the authority of FAR 6.302-2  as this requirement is for food supplies to feed patients hospitalized in the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The agency?s need for the services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.  Delay in award of this requirement could result in serious injury to patients.  The current contractor US Foodservice products being provided to the Nutrition Department at the NIH Clinical Center have been analyzed for nutritional safety and approved by Clinical Dietitians in the Department to be served to Clinical Center patients, many of whom are on very specialized research protocols with extreme dietary restrictions.  These products meet all compliancies established by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) as well as other relevant medical requirements that are integral to patient treatment.  US Foodservcie products have been cataloged in the Department?s Nutrition Information System (CBord) planning patient meals and care plans.  Any other company?s products would have to be analyzed and assessed for patient safety and compliancies established by the JCAHO.  The time required to complete such an analysis and assessment of new products pose an unacceptable risk and danger to patients.  US Foodservice has the required ability to provide the necessary food supplies to the NIH Clinical Center without any lapse in services during the next six (6) months while the Government establishes a long term contract for the provision of required food supplies for patients hospitalized in the Clinical Center. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.     The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the capability of your firm to provide the required food supplies and services.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and a solicitation document will not be issued.     All capability statements received within 5 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed interim purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, TACOM- Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. is conducting a market survey to identify sources that are capable of supplying a lightweight molding  material(s) for cylindrical containers.  Material(s) need to have the ability  to be molded by common processes, particularly injection molding, with a cured  state having a low overall weight and high impact strength.  The material(s)  will be used to fabricate two types of cylindrical ammunition containers: Container #1:  2.72â€ OD (max), 2.40â€ ID (min), 17.73â€ outside length (max),  17.53â€ inside length (min), total estimated weight of .56 lbs.   Container #2:  4â€ OD (max), 3.24â€ID (min), 27.0625â€ outside length (max),  26.5â€ inside length (min), total estimated weight of 3 lbs.  Attached drawings may be used for reference to address concerns regarding the  cap and body tube distinction of each container.  It is desired that the  material(s) identified be of lowest raw material and manufacturing cost while  meeting requirements.  Cured containers shall not creep, exhibit low toxicity,  resist UV and be resistant to such chemicals as hydraulic fluid, gasoline,  ethylene glycol, lubricating oil and diesel fuel.  Low smoke (less than 200  when tested IAW ASTM-E662) and flame spread indexes (less than 25 when tested  IAW ASTM-E162) are desirable.   Both containers must meet performance  requirements of both 3 ft. and 7 ft. drop testing, and vibrational (secured  and loose cargo) testing at -60Â°F, ambient, and +145Â°F temperature extremes in  accordance with MIL-STD-1904A while holding contents weighing 10 lbs. and 4  lbs. for containers 1 and 2 respectively.  One or more materials may be  presented by interested sources, and the two containers need not be made of  the same material.  Manufacturing and disposal processes need to be  environmentally friendly, with ability to dispose in common landfills  necessary. All responding sources shall provide a summary of their company's capabilities including organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, a  description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing process, inspection  capability, personnel, past experience, proven monthly production capacity,  possible partnering/teaming arrangements; and whether the company is a small  or large business.  The market survey is for planning purposes only and shall  not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of  the government.  The Government will utilize the information provided for  planning purposes only.  All information submitted will be provided at no cost  to the government and will be held in a confidential status.  The contractor  shall provide all information requested in this notification within 30 days of  this publication by electronic mail to mescal@pica.army.mil. Reference note 26.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Announcement.  This is not a request for proposal, quotation or bid.  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is looking for contractors capable of providing the services as described below.  The Government will use the responses t o make appropriate acquisition decisions.  Interested sources should respond with a capability statement, list of similar projects, and references, along with documentation of their socio-economic classifications in a document not to exceed 5 pages.  The N AICS Code being considered for this project is 237990 with a size standard of $31M. Background:  The project is referred to as the Lower Kingman Islands project.  The Lower Kingman Islands project involves Lower Kingman Island and adjacent Heritage Island.  Heritage Island is located in Kingman Lake just downstream of Benning Road in Wash ington, DC.  Lower Kingman Island lies between Kingman Lake and the mainstream Anacostia River.  These islands are within Kingman Lake, near RFK Memorial Stadium, on the Anacostia River, on the east side of Washington DC.  Kingman Lake was constructed when  the Corps of Engineers extensively dredged existing freshwater tidal marsh habitat from the 1920s through the 1930s to create recreation opportunities for area residents.  The two islands were created from the dredged material.   Kingman Lake is hydraulic ally connected to the Anacostia River, and is approximately 110 acres in size. The Anacostia River watershed is highly urbanized and has been identified as a high priority area for restoration by the Chesapeake Bay Program. The proposed project would construct aquatic and riparian ecosystem restoration on both Lower Kingman and Heritage Islands.  The major components of the Lower Kingman Islands project consists of restoration of approximately 44 habitat acres, consisting of wetlands (2.3 acres), grasslands (6.5 acres), and forest buffer establishment (11.4 acres).  Restoration will reduce imperviousness on the islands, removing significant invasive vegetative species (greater than 20 acres), planting native forest buffers, co nnecting riparian habitat and restoring vernal pool habitat (Heritage Island).  Some minor passive recreational features are also included.   All interested sources should provide the required information stated above by mail, email or fax by 3:00 p.m., local time, 13 November 2006.  Send responses by mail to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, Contracting Division, P.O. Box 17 15, Baltimore, MD 21203-1715, Attn: Linda M. Evans.

<SUBJECT>Pre-Industry Day Demonstration for Diver Hull Imaging and Navigation System (DHINS)
<DESC>All interested contractors are invited to attend a Pre-Industry Day Demonstration for Diver Hull Imaging and Navigation System (DHINS) with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel.  This system will be used to improve the capabilities of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) divers in conducting Navy Fleet Support Operations.  This event will be held on 28 November 2006 at EDO Corporation, 2800 Shirlington Rd, Suite 1200, Arlington, VA.  Directions to the facility are available upon request; additionally, EDO offices are available by Metro via the Shirlington Gateway shuttle at the Pentagon City Metro stop – if interested in this option, please call 202-207-5825 for schedule.  The objective of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future DHINS procurement.  DHINS will improve the capability of EOD divers to rapidly reconnoiter ship and berthing areas and investigate and localize unexploded ordna!  nce (UXO) objects that impose a threat to Joint and Maritime operations.  Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) are also planned to incorporate system interoperability with Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs); integration with Expeditionary Command ,Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems; and to implement connectivity with a Ship Hull database configured for DHINS applications.  DHINS will be composed of a target detection and imaging sensor integrated with a precise navigation sub-system and a communication sub-system to enable the accurate detection and mapping of targets which present a potential threat to high value assets.  The system will be used by U.S. Navy EOD divers in performing under hull search and target prosecution missions and will be capable of providing a dive team the ability to search one CVN Carrier class Vessel or two smaller vessels without significant degradation of capabilities when conducting operations on two separate !  platforms.  Top-side display and command and control equipment will co mplete the system configuration.  The system will be designed such that its operation will not inadvertently actuate limpet mines equipped with anti-tampering and/or anti-removal features.  Input received from this Pre-Industry Day Demonstration will facilitate refinement of a competitive acquisition strategy.  Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Systems Integration Phase.  Attendance at the Pre-Industry Day Demonstration is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals; however, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions, answers, and industry input.  Seating is limited.  Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per organization.  Read ahead documentation will be posted for viewing or about 17 November 2006.  Attendees are requested to register for the DHINS Pre-Industry Day Demonstration by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(!  s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, address, telephone number, and e-mail address not later than 20 November 2006.  Registration may be faxed or e-mailed to the Technical Point of Contact (POC) below.  The purpose of this Pre-Industry Day Demonstration is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved, nor is the Government obligated to any future acquisition or procurement action.  For questions please contact the Technical POC: Patrick Whang (301) 744-4094, FAX (301) 744-6947, e-mail: patrick.y.whang@ navy.mil. or for contractual issues contact Eddie Rogan at (301) 744-6677, edward.rogan@navy.mil.

Goals of Industry Day:     a. Communicate to industry the anticipated content of each future contract. b. Allow NASA/45SW to solicit industry feedback. c. Promote competition on each of the follow-on acquisitions. d. Identify potential sources.     Questions and Answers for Industry Day:     A question and answer (Q&A) period will follow at the end of the industry day presentation. Industry is reminded that we are in the early acquisition planning phases for the restructuring activity, and therefore we reserve the right to modify or alter our approach. NOTE: No solicitations have been issued and both NASA/45SW anticipate release of draft Requests for Proposal (RFP(s)) in the future for each of identified future contracts.     We anticipate separate industry briefings or other communications with industry for each of the individual acquisitions in the future, as appropriate.

The following FAR and DFARS clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition.  The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.

FAR provision 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  Addenda to 52.212-1:  The following four paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision:  (d) Product Samples (e) Multiple Offers (h) Multiple Awards and (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

52.212-2           EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  
If a proposal has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.  In the evaluation of the lowest price, the Government will determine the advantages and disadvantages that might result from making more than one award (multiple awards).  It is assumed, for the purposes of evaluating offers, that $500.00 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation, and individual awards will be for the items or combination of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including assumed administrative costs.

Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature that clearly indicates that the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  Descriptive literature must be provided for Line Items 0001 through 0007.

Descriptive literature shall also indicate the stretch wrap manufacturer.  This information must be provided since the manufacturer must be a small business in accordance with FAR 52.219-6.




?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a proposal.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the CLIN to which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
    												
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  







The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed 
within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the
services provided.
b.	A list of any ?significant problems? encountered for the contracts reported in response to
paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.

References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

Price
If a proposal has been determined acceptable under each of the non-price factors listed above, the Government will then evaluate the proposal for the lowest price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals.

Contractors are required to include a completed copy of the FAR provision    52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items (Alternate I) and DFARS provision 252-212-7000,  Offeror Representations and Certifications ?

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STRUCTURAL STRENGTH TEST BRANCH DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM ASSEMBLY.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions. 1. Question: Were do you want the 15ft cable that comes out of the Tripp Lite power strip to go?	Have you thought about using an external AC power connection plug like (HUBBELL PN: HBL2325SW)?  Answer:  The cord is to exit the system underneath the BNC panel.  The rear doors of the unit will only be used during moving and shipping.  When the door is attached, the cord is to be coiled up inside the rack. 2. There were no 19” rack mount kits for the SCXI 1001 and PXI 1050 chassis’s specified.  I am assuming they are needed. Answer: Yes, there is an additional part required that should have been included in our parts list.  The part is National Instruments Rack Mount Kit Model SCXI-1370 Part Number 776577-70.  The quantity is four parts per unit. 3. Question: Do you want filler panels for the unused slots in the PXI chassis? Answer: Yes, but all the PXI chassis we have received in prototyping this system had front filler panels already installed at the factory. 4. Question:  Did you mean SCXI 1102 32CH TC Module rather than SCXI 1502? Answer:  No.  We do mean the SCXI-1502.  That is a custom part designed by NI to meet our calibration requirements.   5.  Question:  Did you want BNC/TC 2095 Terminal Block PN: 777508-01 instead of 779709-01? Answer: No. We do mean part number 779709-01. This is the other custom part to which I referred in #4.   6. Question: Would you consider adding a second pair of Mounting Angles? This will eliminate clearance problems with BNC/TC-2095 and the Chassis Guides as well as clearance issues with the Front doors and Mounting Brackets on the PXI/SCXI Chassis.   Answer: Yes.  7. Question: Also, would you consider adding a 2U Blank panel on the Rear of the console?  The Rack Mount Keyboard/Monitor requires a min depth of 27.5 inches.  If the Keyboard/Monitor Tray is 27.5 inches deep and the BNC/TC 2095 is 7.7 inches deep that leaves approximately 1.5 inches clearance for cable connections to the 2095.  Answer:  Yes. 8. Question: What Operating system do you need for the PXI-8105 Controller? Answer: Microsoft Windows XP Professional. 9. Question:  It is atypical for V I Engineering to deliver a system intended to be robust with a series of breadboard modules.  Depending on the requirements for the breadboard circuit there may be a better solution. Please address the following questions: 9.1.	What is the intended usage of the circuit described in the figure “Precision Voltage Standard with Divider Circuit and RDH Synchronization Input/Output” on page 16 of the system specification? 9.2.	Would NASA consider a fabricated PCB in place of the breadboard solution on page 16 of the system specification? 9.3.	Is there an advantage or disadvantage for NASA to receive a fabricated PCB? Answers: 9.1) The described circuit is part of the calibration system, providing a stable nominal voltage of the appropriate range. 9.2) Yes. 9.3) At this time there is no advantage or disadvantage for NASA to receive a fabricated PCB. 10. Question: The system specification requires documentation for summarizing the build and testing procedure.	However, there is no mention of additional documentation requirements. 10.1.	Does NASA require that mechanical drawings be produced and shipped with each system?  10.2.	Does NASA require that any electrical drawings be produced and shipped with each system? Answer: 2.1) Mechanical drawings are not required.  Any changes made to assembly procedure should be described in text and with a sketch. 2.2) Electrical drawings would be needed if any changes were proposed and made to circuits or custom electronic components.  The due date for receipt of offers is OR  extended to November 1, 2006. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 10/16/06.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
